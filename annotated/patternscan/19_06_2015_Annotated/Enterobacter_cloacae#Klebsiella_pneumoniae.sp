TI  == enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae; versatile bacterial pathogens confronting antibiotic treatment.
AB  == enterobacter aerogenes and e. cloacae have been reported as important opportunistic and multiresistant bacterial pathogens for humans during the last three decades in hospital wards. these gram-negative bacteria have been largely described during several outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections in europe and  particularly in france. the dissemination of enterobacter sp. is associated with  the presence of redundant regulatory cascades that efficiently control the membrane permeability ensuring the bacterial protection and the expression of detoxifying enzymes involved in antibiotic degradation/inactivation. in addition, these bacterial species are able to acquire numerous genetic mobile elements that strongly contribute to antibiotic resistance. moreover, this particular fitness help them to colonize several environments and hosts and rapidly and efficiently  adapt their metabolism and physiology to external conditions and environmental stresses. enterobacter is a versatile bacterium able to promptly respond to the antibiotic treatment in the colonized patient. the balance of the prevalence, e.  aerogenes versus e. cloacae, in the reported hospital infections during the last  period, questions about the horizontal transmission of mobile elements containing antibiotic resistance genes, e.g., the efficacy of the exchange of resistance genes klebsiella pneumoniae to enterobacter sp. it is also important to mention the possible role of antibiotic use in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases in this e. aerogenes/e. cloacae evolution.

TI  == phenotypic expression and prevalence of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in samples collected from patients in various wards of mulago hospital, uganda.
AB  == background: resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins among enterobacteriaceae has been reported yet they serve as the last line treatment for severe infections in uganda and other countries. this resistance often leads  to nosocomial infection outbreaks and therapeutic failures from multidrug resistant bacteria. the main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae in clinical samples of patients in various wards of mulago hospital; uganda's main national referral and teaching hospital. methods: this cross-sectional study was conducted between january-april, 2014. purposive consecutive sampling was used to collect pus swab, urine, blood and csf samples from patients in the various wards. a total of 245 consecutive, non-repetitive, clinical samples were obtained and tested for phenotypic esbl production using the double disc synergy test using cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime-clavulanic acid and ceftazidime-clavulanic acid. results: results show that 47 % of the 245  samples had enterobacteriaceae isolates. of these isolates 62 % were esbl producers while 38 % were of non-esbl phenotype. e. coli was the most isolated organism (53.9 %), followed by k. pneumoniae (28.7 %). majority of enterobacteriaceae organisms were isolated from urine samples, followed by pus samples and of these 64.9 % and 47.4 % were esbl-producers respectively. klebsiella pneumoniae had the highest percentage of esbl producers (72.7 %). there was a higher percentage of isolates showing resistance to ceftazidime (73 %) compared to cefotaxime (57.5 %). all enterobacter cloacae isolates showed resistance to ceftazidime. there were no statistically significant association between phenotype (esbl/non-esbl) and patients' age or gender or enterobacteriaceae spp. conclusions: this study reveals a high prevalence of esbl producing organisms in mulago hospital and high levels of resistance to third generation cephalosporins. in addition to undertaking appropriate infection control measures, there is urgent need for formulation of an antibiotic policy in uganda to prevent spread of these organisms. this also calls for continuous monitoring and reporting of the presence of such organisms in order to ensure rational and judicious use of antibiotics by clinicians.

TI  == molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae from humans in the community.
AB  == objective: to investigate the molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (esc)-resistant enterobacteriaceae collected during a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence and risk factors for faecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae  in humans living in areas with high or low broiler density. methods: esc-resistant enterobacteriaceae were identified by combination disc-diffusion test. esbl/ampc/carbapenemase genes were analysed using pcr and sequencing. for e. coli, phylogenetic groups and mlst were determined. plasmids were characterized by transformation and pcr-based replicon typing. subtyping of plasmids was done by plasmid multilocus sequence typing. results: 175 esc-resistant enterobacteriaceae were cultured from 165/1,033 individuals. the isolates were escherichia coli(n=65), citrobacter freundii (n=52), enterobacter cloacae (n=38), morganella morganii (n=5), enterobacter aerogenes (n=4), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=3), hafnia alvei (n=2), shigella spp. (n=2), citrobacter amalonaticus (n=1), escherichia hermannii (n=1), kluyvera cryocrescens (n=1), and pantoea agglomerans (n=1). the following esbl genes were recovered in 55 isolates originating from 49 of 1,033 (4.7 %) persons: blactx-m-1 (n=17), blactx-m-15 (n=16), blactx-m-14 (n=9), blactx-m-2 (n=3), blactx-m-3 (n=2), blactx-m-24 (n=2), blactx-m-27 (n=1), blactx-m-32 (n=1), blashv-12 (n=2), blashv-65 (n=1) and blatem-52 (n=1). plasmidic ampc (pampc) genes were discovered in 6 out of 1,033 (0.6 %) persons. one person carried two different e. coli isolates, one with blactx-m-1 and the other with blacmy-2 and therefore the prevalence of persons carrying enterobacteriaceae harboring esbl and/or pampc genes was 5.2 %. in eight e. coli isolates the ampc phenotype was caused by mutations in the ampc promoter  region. no carbapenemase genes were identified. a large variety of e. coli genotypes was found, st131 and st10 being most common. conclusions: esbl/pampc genes resembled those from patients in dutch hospitals, indicating that healthy humans form a reservoir for transmission of these determinants to vulnerable people. the role of poultry in the transmission to humans in the community remains to be elucidated.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftolozane alone and in combination with tazobactam against extended spectrum beta-lactamase harboring enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == ceftolozane formally, cxa-101, is a new antipseudomonal cephalosporin that is also active in vitro against enterobacteriaceae, but is vulnerable to extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the addition of tazobactam is intended to broaden coverage of most esbl-producing e. coli and k. pneumonia as well as other enterobacteriaceae. the in vitro activities of ceftolozane/tazobactam combinations against 67 clinically and molecularly characterized esbl producing isolates were examined by checkerboard mic to evaluate its potential clinical feasibility and to assess the optimal tazobactam concentrations to be used in mic determinations of ceftolozane. isolates included escherichia coli (n=32), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=19), enterobacter cloacae (n=15) and 1 citrobacter freundii. checkerboard experiments were performed to study interactions over the  range of 0.008-64 mg/l ceftolozane and 0.063-32 mg/l tazobactam using two-fold dilution series. the mic50 and mic90 of ceftolozane alone for all isolates were 16 and >/=64 mg/l respectively. increasing concentrations of tazobactam resulted  in decreasing mics of ceftolozane. the 50th and 90th percentile concentrations of tazobactam required to reduce the mic of ceftolozane to 8 mg/l for all organisms  in this esbl collection were 0.5 and 4 mg/l respectively. for e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae these values were 0.5 and 2, 1 and 16, and 0.5 and 4 mg/l respectively. when combined with a fixed amount of 4 mg/l tazobactam (current clsi concentration used for susceptibility testing), 90% of the isolates would have an mic of </=4 mg/l. the combination ceftolozane/tazobactam is a promising alternative option for treating infections due to esbl harboring isolates.

TI  == clonal dissemination of oxa-370- producing klebsiella pneumoniae in rio de janeiro, brazil.
AB  == enzymes of the oxa-48-family have become one of the most important beta-lactamases in the world. a new oxa-48 variant (oxa-370) was first described  in an enterobacter hormaechei isolated in rio grande do sul (south region of brazil) in 2013. here we report the detection of the blaoxa-370 gene in 24 isolates belonging to three enterobacteriaceae species (22 in klebsiella pneumoniae, 01 in enterobacter cloacae and 01 in enterobacter aerogenes) from five hospitals in rio de janeiro in 2013 and 2014. the isolates showed a multidrug resistance profile and 12.5% were resistant to polymyxin b. besides blaoxa-370, no other carbapenemase genes were observed, by pcr, whereas blaoxa-1  was found in all isolates and 22 (91.6%) possessed blactx-m-15. molecular typing  by pfge in the k. pneumoniae isolates, showed the presence of two clonal groups (kpa - 21 isolates and kpb - 1 isolate). kpa was characterized as st16 and kpb as st1041 by mlst. st16 has been observed in kpc-producing k. pneumoniae in rio de janeiro. plasmid analysis performed in six oxa-370-representative isolates showed plasmids harboring the blaoxa-370 gene in all strains, ranging from 25 kb to 150  kb. thus, this study suggests that there is an urgent need to investigate the presence of oxa-370 and the dissemination of the clone k. pneumoniae st16 carrying this gene in brazil.

TI  == inhibition of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase resistance enzymes by metal salts.
AB  == aminoglycosides (ags) are clinically relevant antibiotics used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as mycobacteria. as with all current antibacterial agents, resistance to ags is an increasing problem. the most common mechanism of resistance to ags is the presence of ag-modifying enzymes (ames) in bacterial cells, with ag acetyltransferases (aacs) being the most prevalent. recently, it was discovered that zn(2+) metal ions displayed an inhibitory effect on the resistance enzyme aac(6')-ib in acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli. in this study, we explore a wide array of metal salts (mg(2+), cr(3+), cr(6+), mn(2+), co(2+), ni(2+), cu(2+), zn(2+), cd(2+), and au(3+) with different counter ions) and their inhibitory effect on a large repertoire of aacs [aac(2')-ic, aac(3)-ia, aac(3)-ib, aac(3)-iv, aac(6')-ib', aac(6')-ie, aac(6')-iid, and eis]. in addition, we determine the mic values for amikacin and tobramycin in combination  with a zinc pyrithione complex in clinical isolates of various bacterial strains  (two strains of a. baumannii, three of enterobacter cloacae, and four of klebsiella pneumoniae) and one representative of each species purchased from the  american type culture collection.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of kpc-2-producing enterobacteriaceae (non-klebsiella pneumoniae) isolated from brazil.
AB  == in brazil, since 2009, there has been an ever increasing widespread of the blakpc-2 gene, mainly in klebsiella pneumoniae. this study aims to assess the molecular epidemiology and genetic background of this gene in enterobacteriaceae  (non-k. pneumoniae) species from 9 brazilian states between 2009 and 2011. three  hundred eighty-seven isolates were analyzed exhibiting nonsusceptibility to carbapenems, in which the blakpc-2 gene was detected in 21.4%. by disk diffusion  and e-test, these isolates exhibited high rates of resistance to most of the antimicrobials tested, including tigecycline (45.6% nonsusceptible) and polymyxin b (16.5%), the most resistant species being enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae. we found great clonal diversity and a variety of blakpc-2-carrying plasmids, all of them exhibiting a partial tn4401 structure. therefore, this study demonstrates the dissemination of kpc-2 in 9 enterobacteriaceae species, including species that were not previously described  such as pantoea agglomerans and providencia stuartii.

TI  == dominance of imp-4-producing enterobacter cloacae among carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in australia.
AB  == the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) has been increasing worldwide. blaimp has been reported to be the predominant carbapenemase-encoding gene within enterobacteriaceae in australia. however, there are limited data currently available on cpe from queensland, australia. a total of 58 cpe isolates were isolated between july 2009 and march 2014 from queensland hospitals. the clonality of isolates was determined by diversilab repetitive sequence-based pcr. the isolates were investigated for the resistance  mechanisms carbapenemase, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and ampc beta-lactamase and for aminoglycoside resistance and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes by pcr. the plasmid types associated with carbapenemase-encoding genes were characterized. the majority of the cpe were enterobacter cloacae (n =  29). the majority of queensland cpe isolates were imp producers and comprised 11  species (n = 48). nine ndm-producing enterobacteriaceae were identified. one ndm-producing klebsiella pneumoniae isolate coproduced oxa-48. one k. pneumoniae  isolate was an oxa-181 producer. the incidence of imp producers increased significantly in 2013. blaimp-4 was found in all imp-producing isolates. blatem,  qnrb, and aaca4 were common among imp-4 producers. the hi2 (67%) and l/m (21%) replicons were associated with blaimp-4. all hi2 plasmids were of sequence type 1 (st1). all but one of the ndm producers possessed blactx-m-15. the 16s rrna methylase genes found among ndm producers were arma, rmtb, rmtc, and rmtf. the substantial increase in the prevalence of cpe in queensland has been associated mainly with the emergence e. cloacae strains possessing hi2 plasmids carrying blaimp-4 over the past 2 years. the importation of ndm producers and/or oxa-48-like producers in patients also contributed to the increased emergence of  cpe.

TI  == [the biological characteristics of dominated agents of acute enteric infections].
AB  == in 2003-2012 the rate of increase of morbidity of acute enteric infections caused by opportunistic microorganisms came to 3.6%. in the etiologic structure prevailed klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterobacter cloacae.  their percentage varied from 70.5% to 81.6%. the opportunistic microorganisms isolated from feces of patients with acute enteric infections and individuals from control group characterized by presence of pathogenic factors of broad spectrum. the adhesive characteristics were manifested by 50.8+/-4.4% of analyzed cultures isolated from patients with symptoms of diarrhea infection and by 19.5+/-3.5% in control group. the anti-lysozyme activity was manifested correspondingly in 86.2+/-3.0% and 61.7+/-4.3% of strains. the anti-complement activity was manifested in 70.8+/-3.9% and 61.7+/-4.3% of strains. the anti-interferon activity was manifested in 100% and 95.3+/-1.9% of strains correspondingly. the level of adhesive activity in e. cloacae (35.0+/-7.5%) and anti-complement and adhesive activity in k. pneumoniae consisted 100% and 85.0+/-5.6% of strains isolated from feces of patients with acute enteric infections reliably (p<0.05) exceeded values in individuals from control group.

TI  == multidrug resistance found in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae from rural water reservoirs in guantao, china.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae have been isolated from humans and animals across the world. however, data on prevalence of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae from rural water reservoirs is limited. this study aimed to isolate and characterize esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in rural water reservoirs in guantao, china. esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae were  found in 5 (16.7%) of 30 sampled rural water reservoirs. sixty-six individual isolates expressing an esbl phenotype were obtained in the present study. species identification showed that 42 representatives of escherichia coli, 17 klebsiella  pneumoniae, 4 raoultella planticola, and 3 enterobacter cloacae. twenty isolates  contained a single bla gene, including ctx-m (17 strains), tem (2 strains), and shv (1 strain). forty-six isolates contained more than one type of beta-lactamase genes. esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated in this study were all multidrug resistant. these findings indicated that the serious contamination of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in rural water reservoirs existed in guantao, china.

TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against enterobacteriaceae isolates from u.s. hospitals (2011 to 2013) and characterization of beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) inhibited 99.9% (20,698/20,709) of enterobacteriaceae isolates at </=8 mug/ml. this compound was  active against resistant subsets, including ceftazidime-nonsusceptible enterobacter cloacae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype isolates. an esbl phenotype was noted among 12.4% (1,696/13,692 isolates from targeted species) of the isolates, including 776 escherichia coli (12.0% for this species; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 721 klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 119 klebsiella oxytoca (10.3%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and 80 proteus mirabilis (4.9%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) isolates. the most common enzymes detected among esbl phenotype isolates from 2013 (n = 743) screened using a microarray-based assay were ctx-m-15-like (n = 307), kpc (n = 120), shv esbls (n = 118), and ctx-m-14-like (n = 110). kpc producers were highly resistant to comparators, and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.3% susceptible) were the most active agents against these strains. meropenem (mic50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml) and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) were active against ctx-m-producing isolates. other enzymes were also observed, and ceftazidime-avibactam displayed good activity against the isolates producing less common enzymes. among 11 isolates displaying ceftazidime-avibactam mic values of >8 mug/ml, three were k. pneumoniae strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases (all ceftazidime-avibactam mics, >32 mug/ml), with two ndm-1 producers and one k. pneumoniae strain carrying the blakpc-2 and blavim-4 genes. therapeutic options for isolates producing beta-lactamases may be limited, and ceftazidime-avibactam, which displayed good activity against strains, including those producing kpc enzymes, merits further study in infections where such organisms occur.

TI  == prospective multicenter study of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae from  83 hospitals in spain reveals high in vitro susceptibility to colistin and meropenem.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the impact of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) in spain in 2013 by describing the prevalence, dissemination, and geographic distribution of cpe clones, and their population structure and antibiotic susceptibility. from february 2013 to may 2013, 83 hospitals (about 40,000 hospital beds) prospectively collected nonduplicate enterobacteriaceae using the screening cutoff recommended by eucast. carbapenemase characterization was performed by phenotypic methods and confirmed  by pcr and sequencing. multilocus sequencing types (mlst) were determined for klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. a total of 702 enterobacteriaceae isolates met the inclusion criteria; 379 (54%) were cpe. oxa-48 (71.5%) and vim-1 (25.3%) were the most frequent carbapenemases, and k. pneumoniae (74.4%), enterobacter cloacae (10.3%), and e. coli (8.4%) were the species most affected.  susceptibility to colistin, amikacin, and meropenem was 95.5%, 81.3%, and 74.7%,  respectively. the most prevalent sequence types (sts) were st11 and st405 for k.  pneumoniae and st131 for e. coli. forty-five (54.1%) of the hospitals had at least one cpe case. for k. pneumoniae, st11/oxa-48, st15/oxa-48, st405/oxa-48, and st11/vim-1 were detected in two or more spanish provinces. st11 isolates carried four carbapenemases (vim-1, oxa-48, kpc-2, and oxa-245), but st405 isolates carried oxa-48 only. a wide interregional spread of cpe in spain was observed, mainly due to a few successful clones of oxa-48-producing k. pneumoniae (e.g., st11 and st405). the dissemination of oxa-48-producing e. coli is a new finding of public health concern. according to the susceptibilities determined in vitro, most of the cpe (94.5%) had three or more options for antibiotic treatment.

TI  == the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), a simple and low-cost alternative for the carba np test to assess phenotypic carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods.
AB  == a new phenotypic test, called the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), was developed to detect carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods within eight hours. this method showed high concordance with results obtained by pcr to detect genes coding for the carbapenemases kpc, ndm, oxa-48, vim, imp and oxa-23. it allows reliable detection of carbapenemase activity encoded by various genes in species of enterobacteriaceae (e.g., klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and  enterobacter cloacae), but also in non-fermenters pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the cim was shown to be a cost-effective and highly robust phenotypic screening method that can reliably detect carbapenemase activity.

TI  == carbapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacteriaceae in taiwan.
AB  == a total of 1135 carbapenem-resistant (nonsusceptible) enterobacteriaceae (cre) isolates were recovered between november 2010 and july 2012 (517 from 2010-2011 and 618 from 2012) from 4 hospitals in taiwan. carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) comprised 5.0% (57 isolates), including 17 kpc-2 (16 klebsiella pneumoniae and 1 escherichia coli), 1 ndm-1 (k. oxytoca), 37 imp-8 (26 enterobacter cloacae, 4 citrobacter freundii, 4 raoultella planticola, 1 k. pneumoniae, 1 e. coli and 1 k. oxytoca), and 2 vim-1 (1 e. cloacae, 1 e. coli). the kpc-2-positive k. pneumoniae were highly clonal even in isolates from different hospitals, and all were st11. imp-8 positive e. cloacae from the same hospitals showed higher similarity in pfge pattern than those from different hospitals. a total of 518 cre isolates (45.6%) were positive for blaesbl, while 704 (62.0%) isolates were blaampc-positive, 382 (33.6% overall) of which carried  both blaesbl and blaampc. ctx-m (414, 80.0%) was the most common blaesbl, while dha (497, 70.6%) and cmy (157, 22.3%) were the most common blaampc. co-carriage of blaesbl and blaampc was detected in 31 (54.4%) and 15 (26.3%) of the 57 cpe, respectively. kpc-2 was the most common carbapenemase detected in k. pneumoniae (2.8%), while imp-8 was the most common in e. cloacae (9.7%). all kpc-2-positive  cre were resistant to all three tested carbapenems. however, fourteen of the 37 imp-8-positive cre were susceptible to both imipenem and meropenem in vitro. intra- and inter-hospital spread of kpc-2-producing k. pneumoniae and imp-8-producing e. cloacae likely occurred. although the prevalence of cpe is still low, careful monitoring is urgently needed. non-susceptibility to ertapenem might need to be considered as one criterion of definition for cre in areas where imp type carbapenemase is prevalent.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to confirm the existence of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae carrying the bla ndm-1 gene in clinics in hainan province, china. collected clinical bacterial isolates that were enterobacteriaceae strains suspected of producing carbapenemase were used as experimental strains. drug resistance to imipenem, meropenem and other antibacterial agents was tested. imipenem/imipenem inhibitor (ip/ipi) e-testing was conducted to identify the bacterial strains that produced metallo-beta-lactamases. the bla ndm-1 drug resistance gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and agarose gel electrophoresis (age) and sequencing were conducted to identify the products. the species of the strains carrying the bla ndm-1 gene were determined using a biochemical identification system. through the ip/ipi e-test, 21 of the 30 collected enterobacteriaceae strains were found to be positive, indicating that 70% of the strains produced metallo-beta-lactamases. following bla ndm-1 gene pcr amplification, age and sequencing tests confirmed that nine of the strains carried the bla ndm-1 drug resistance gene. the biochemical identification system indicated that four of the strains were klebsiella pneumoniae, two were escherichia coli, two were enterobacter cloacae and one was enterobacter aerogenes. drug susceptibility testing in vitro demonstrated that the strains were 100% resistant to a broad spectrum antibiotic plus lactamase inhibitor, cephalosporins and carbapenems. however, they had high sensitivity rates to polymyxin b and tigecycline of 100 and 88.9%, respectively. the sensitivity rate  to amikacin was also high at 77.8%, whereas sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was moderate at rates of 44.4 and 33.3% respectively. this clinical study of enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the bla ndm-1 gene in hainan shows a bacterial tolerance that is different from that in previous studies, which requires further in-depth study.

TI  == predominance of kpc-3 in a survey for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae  in portugal.
AB  == among the 2,105 enterobacteriaceae tested in a survey done in portugal, 165 were  nonsusceptible to carbapenems, from which 35 (26 klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 escherichia coli, 2 enterobacter aerogenes, and 3 enterobacter cloacae isolates and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate) were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers by the presence of 30 tn4401d-blakpc-3, 4 inti3-blages-5, and one inti1-blavim-2 gene, alone or in combination with other bla genes. the dissemination of blakpc-3 gene carried by an incf plasmid suggests lateral gene transfer as a major mechanism of dissemination.

TI  == a statistical approach for determination of disk diffusion-based cutoff values for systematic characterization of wild-type and non-wild-type bacterial populations in antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == in this study, we introduce a new approach for determination of epidemiologic cutoffs (ecoffs) and resistant-population cutoffs (rcoffs) based on receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. as an example, the method was applied for  determination of ecoffs for seven different beta-lactam antibiotics and wild-type populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae. in addition, rcoffs were determined for bacterial populations with defined resistance mechanisms ("resistotypes"), i.e., extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-positive e. coli, esbl-positive k. pneumoniae, and esbl-positive e. cloacae; ampc cephalosporinase-positive e. coli and ampc-positive k. pneumoniae;  and broad-spectrum beta-lactamase (bsbl)-positive e. coli. rcoffs and ecoffs are  instrumental for a systematic characterization of associations between resistotypes and wild-type populations.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == carbapenem susceptibility among escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae isolates obtained from patients in intensive care units in taiwan in 2005, 2007, and 2009.
AB  == to investigate the evolutionary trends in non-susceptibility of carbapenems against the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan during 2005-2009, we applied the breakpoints of mics recommended by clinical and laboratory standards institute and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing in 2013. escalations in imipenem mic levels for overall e. coli and e. cloacae isolates and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing k. pneumoniae isolates were noted during this period. the overall mic levels against imipenem and meropenem for subgroups of esbl producers of 3 enterobacteriaceae species were significantly higher than those of respective overall groups in 2007 and 2009. compared with meropenem, we found that significant evidence of imipenem mic creep and evidence of extraordinarily high rates of non-susceptibility to ertapenem among isolates of 3 species in 2009 existed. the prominent rises in rates of ertapenem non-susceptibility for esbl-producing e. coli and k. pneumoniae during  2005-2009 and rate of esbl positivity for e. cloacae between 4 years were notably found. based on our findings, ertapenem should be used cautiously in management of the icu infections caused by these potentially esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates in taiwan.

TI  == in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

TI  == alveolar and serum concentrations of imipenem in two lung transplant recipients supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
AB  == venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) is increasingly used in patients with respiratory failure who fail conventional treatment. postoperative  pneumonia is the most common infection after lung transplantation (40%). imipenem is frequently used for empirical treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive care unit. nevertheless, few data are available on the impact of ecmo on pharmacokinetics, and no data on imipenem dosing during ecmo. currently, no guidelines exist for antibiotic dosing during ecmo support. we report the cases of 2 patients supported with venovenous ecmo for refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome following single lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis, treated empirically with 1 g of imipenem intravenously every 6 h. enterobacter cloacae was isolated from the respiratory sample of patient 1 and klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from the respiratory sample of patient 2. minimum inhibitory concentrations of the 2 isolated strains were 0.125 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. both patients were still alive on day 28. this is the first report, to our knowledge, of imipenem concentrations in lung transplantation patients supported with ecmo. this study confirms high variability in imipenem trough concentrations in patients on ecmo and with preserved renal function. an elevated dosing regimen (4 g/24 h) is more likely to optimize drug exposure, and therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended, where available. population pharmacokinetic studies are indicated to develop evidence-based dosing guidelines for ecmo patients.

TI  == evolution of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae at the global and national level: what should be expected in the future?
AB  == in recent years, enterobacteriaceae isolates have increased their potential to become highly drug resistant by acquiring resistance to carbapenems, primarily due to the production of acquired carbapenemases. the carbapenemases detected in  enterobacteriaceae are largely of the kpc, vim, ndm, imp and oxa-48 types. although the epidemiological origin and geographic distribution of carbapenemases are clearly different, they all first appeared in the late 20th century. only a decade later, these enzymes have already become established and have expanded globally. an important epidemiological change has occurred in spain in recent years, characterized by a rapid increase in the number of cases of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe), causing both nosocomial outbreaks and single infections. the impact of cpe in spain is primarily due to oxa-48-producing and vim-1-producing klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, although other species such as escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae are also increasing. the emergence of cpe as a cause of community-onset infections is a matter of great concern. taking into account recent experience, and considering the fact that increasing numbers of patients are becoming infected by cpe and reservoirs of carbapenemases are growing globally, the trend of the cpe epidemic  points toward a rise in its incidence. to prevent a massive cpe pandemic, a well-coordinated response from all health professionals and national and supranational authorities is clearly needed.

TI  == [trends in antibiotic resistance in medellin and municipalities of the metropolitan area between 2007 and 2012: results of six years of surveillance].
AB  == introduction: bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance  programs. objective: to determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in medellin and its metropolitan area. materials and methods: percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using whonet 5.6 program. for interpretation of susceptibility results, clsi standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. using the epi-info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. results: in six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). in escherichia coli and serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). k. pneumoniae , s. marcescens and  e. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii .  conclusions: the resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of e. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae . it is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime-avibactam combination in in vitro checkerboard assays.
AB  == to evaluate the in vitro effects of the combination of ceftazidime and avibactam  on the mics of both compounds, checkerboard assays were performed for 81 clinical strains, including 55 enterobacteriaceae strains (32 klebsiella pneumoniae, 19 escherichia coli, 1 citrobacter freundii, and 3 enterobacter cloacae) and 26 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, all with known resistance mechanisms such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and carbapenemases, phenotypically or molecularly determined. phenotypically ceftazidime-resistant strains (n=69) were  analyzed in more detail. for the enterobacteriaceae strains, a concentration-dependent effect of avibactam was found for most strains with a maximum effect of avibactam at a concentration of 4 mg/liter, which decreased all ceftazidime mics to </=4 mg/liter. avibactam alone also showed antibacterial activity (the mic50 and mic90 being 8 and 16 mg/liter, respectively). for the ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa strains, considerable inhibition of beta-lactamases by avibactam was acquired at a concentration of 4 mg/liter, which decreased all ceftazidime mics except one to </=8 mg/liter (the clsi and eucast susceptible breakpoint). increasing the concentration of avibactam further decreased the mics, resulting in a maximum effect for most strains at 8 to 16 mg/liter. in summary, for most strains, the tested addition of avibactam of 4 mg/liter restored the antibacterial activity of ceftazidime to a level comparable to that of wild-type strains, indicating full inhibition, and strains became susceptible according to the eucast and clsi criteria. based on these in vitro data, avibactam is a promising inhibitor of different beta-lactamases, including  esbls and carbapenemases.

TI  == prevalence and diversity of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae from marine beach waters.
AB  == a total of 1,351 enterobacteriaceae isolates from 144 seawater samples were collected over a four-year period from three public beaches in the eastern adriatic sea in croatia. approximately 35% of the strains were multidrug-resistant. blaesbl genes were detected in 4.2% of the isolated enterobacteriaceae, the main species of which were escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. blatem-1+shv-12 was the most dominant genotype, followed by blactx-m-15.raoultella terrigena and e. intermedius simultaneously harboured blatem-1,blashv-11/12 and blactx-m-15. isolate fingerprinting revealed that marine e. coli isolates were clonally related to ctx-m-producing strains from a regional university hospital. these results indicate that marine beach waters are reservoirs of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and thus constitute a public health problem with further potential to act as mediators in gene flow between marine coastal areas and clinical settings.

TI  == epidemiological characteristics of blandm-1 in enterobacteriaceae and the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii complex in china from 2011 to 2012.
AB  == objectives: the study aimed to investigate the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of blandm-1 (encoding new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1) in enterobacteriaceae and the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii complex (abc) in china from july 2011 to june 2012. methods: pcr was used to screen for the presence of blandm-1 in all organisms studied. for blandm-1-positive strains, 16s rrna analysis and analytical profile index (api) strips were used to identify the bacterial genus and species. the abcs were reconfirmed by pcr detection of blaoxa-51-like. antibiotic susceptibilities of the bacteria were assessed by determining minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)  of them using two-fold agar dilution test, as recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). molecular typing was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). s1 nuclease-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (s1-pfge) and southern blot hybridization were conducted to ascertain the gene location of blandm-1. conjugation experiments were conducted to determine the transmission of blandm-1-positive strains. results: among 2,170  enterobacteriaceae and 600 abcs, seven enterobacteriaceae strains and two a. calcoaceticus isolates from five different cities carried the blandm-1 gene. the  seven enterobacteriaceae strains comprised four klebsiella pneumoniae, one enterobacter cloacae, one enterobacter aerogen and one citrobacter freundii. all  seven were non-susceptible to imipenem, meropenem or ertapenem. two a. calcoaceticus species were resistant to imipenem and meropenem. three k. pneumoniae showed the same pfge profiles. the blandm-1 genes of eight strains were localized on plasmids, while one was chromosomal. conclusions: compared with previous reports, the numbers and species containing the blandm-1 in enterobacteriaceae have significantly increased in china. most of them are able to disseminate the gene, which is cause for concern. consecutive surveillance should be implemented and should also focus on the dissemination of blandm-1 among gram-negative clinical isolates.

TI  == countrywide spread of oxa-48 carbapenemase in lebanon: surveillance and genetic characterization of carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae in 10 hospitals over a one-year period.
AB  == objectives: to detect, characterize, and assess the genetic clonality of carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae in 10 lebanese hospitals in 2012. methods: selected enterobacteriaceae isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems were subject to phenotypic study including antibiotic susceptibility, cloxacillin effect, modified hodge test, and activity of efflux pump inhibitor. carbapenemase genes were detected using pcr; clonal relatedness was studied by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. results: out of 8717 enterobacteriaceae isolated in 2012, 102 (1.2%) showed reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. thirty-one (70%) of the 44 studied clinical isolates harbored blaoxa-48, including 15 klebsiella pneumoniae, eight escherichia coli, four serratia marcescens, three enterobacter cloacae, and one morganella morganii. the majority of oxa-48 producers co-secreted an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, while one had an acquired ampc of the acc type. in the non-oxa-48 producers, carbapenem resistance was attributed to the production of acquired ampc cephalosporinases of mox or cit type, outer membrane impermeability, and/or efflux pump overproduction. dna fingerprints revealed that oxa-48 producers were different, except for clonal relatedness among four k. pneumoniae, two e. coli, two e. cloacae, and three s. marcescens. conclusions: nosocomial carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae are moderately spread in lebanon and the predominant mechanism is oxa-48 production.

TI  == a five-year experience of carbapenem resistance in enterobacteriaceae causing neonatal septicaemia: predominance of ndm-1.
AB  == treatment of neonatal sepsis has become a challenge with the emergence of carbapenemase-producing bacteria. this study documents the trend of carbapenem susceptibility in enterobacteriaceae that caused septicaemia in neonates over a five year period (2007-2011) and the molecular characterisation of enterobacteriaceae resistant to carbapenems and cephalosporins. hundred and five  enterobacteriaceae including escherichia coli (n = 27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n  = 68) and enterobacter spp. (n = 10) were isolated from blood of septicaemic neonates followed by antibiotic susceptibility tests, determination of mic values, phenotypic and genotypic detection of beta-lactamases. carbapenem was the most active antimicrobial tested after tigecycline. ctx-m type was the most prevalent esbl throughout the period (82%). new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1), which is a recent addition to the carbapenemase list, was the only carbapenemase identified in our setting. fourteen percent of the isolates possessed blandm-1. carbapenem non-susceptibility was first observed in 2007 and  it was due to loss of omp f/ompk36 in combination with the presence of esbls/ampcs. ndm-1 first emerged in e. coli during 2008; later in 2010, the resistance was detected in k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae isolates. ndm-1-producing isolates were resistant to other broad-spectrum antibiotics and possessed esbls,  ampcs, 16s-rrna methylases, aac(6')-ib-cr, bleomycin resistant gene and class 1 integron. pulsed field gel electrophoresis of the ndm-1-producing isolates indicated that the isolates were clonally diverse. the study also showed that there was a significantly higher incidence of sepsis caused by ndm-1-harbouring isolates in the male sex, in neonates with low birth weight and neonates born at  an extramural centre. however, sepsis with ndm-1-harbouring isolates did not result in a higher mortality rate. the study is the first to review the carbapenem resistance patterns in neonatal sepsis over an extended period of time. the study highlights the persistence of esbls (ctx-ms) and the emergence of ndm-1 in enterobacteriaceae in the unit.

TI  == incidence of fecal enterobacteriaceae producing broad-spectrum beta-lactamases in patients with hematological malignancies.
AB  == aim: given the steadily increasing numbers of resistant bacteria, the frequency and severity of infections are on the rise. in patients with hematological malignancies, the treatment itself increases the risk of complicating bacterial infections. one important mechanisms of resistance is production of broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, increasingly detected not only in bacterial pathogens but also in bacteria contained in the normal microflora of the human body. the objectives of this study were determination and analysis of the prevalence of multiresistant esbl- and ampc-positive enterobacteriaceae in the gastrointestinal tract (git) of patients with hematological malignancies. methods: for 3 months, rectal swabs were taken from patients with hematological malignancies and analyzed using chromogenic screening plates to isolate esbl- and ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae. beta-lactamase production was determined by phenotype tests and confirmed by detecting genes encoding esbl and ampc types. at the same time, esbl- and ampc-positive enterobacteriaceae were isolated from clinical samples collected from patients with bacterial infection. results: over  the study period, fifteen patients (21%) of all patients treated at the department of hemato-oncology were shown to have esbl- or ampc-positive enterobacteriaceae in their git. most frequently identified were esbl-positive strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and ampc-positive strains of citrobacter freundii. the esbl enzymes were mainly of the ctx-m type. isolates producing ampc were found to contain genes for enzymes mainly from the cit and dha groups. conclusion: the study identified patients diagnosed with urinary tract and bloodstream infections caused by esbl-positive strain of klebsiella pneumoniae and ampc-positive strain of enterobacter cloacae contained in the git microflora.

TI  == single-molecule sequencing to track plasmid diversity of hospital-associated carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == public health officials have raised concerns that plasmid transfer between enterobacteriaceae species may spread resistance to carbapenems, an antibiotic class of last resort, thereby rendering common health care-associated infections  nearly impossible to treat. to determine the diversity of carbapenemase-encoding  plasmids and assess their mobility among bacterial species, we performed comprehensive surveillance and genomic sequencing of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in the national institutes of health (nih) clinical center patient population and hospital environment. we isolated a repertoire of carbapenemase-encoding enterobacteriaceae, including multiple strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and pantoea species. long-read genome sequencing with full end-to-end assembly revealed that these organisms carry the carbapenem  resistance genes on a wide array of plasmids. k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae isolated simultaneously from a single patient harbored two different carbapenemase-encoding plasmids, indicating that plasmid transfer between organisms was unlikely within this patient. we did, however, find evidence of horizontal transfer of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids between k. pneumoniae, e.  cloacae, and c. freundii in the hospital environment. our data, including full plasmid identification, challenge assumptions about horizontal gene transfer events within patients and identify possible connections between patients and the hospital environment. in addition, we identified a new carbapenemase-encoding plasmid of potentially high clinical impact carried by k. pneumoniae, e. coli, e. cloacae, and pantoea species, in unrelated patients and in the hospital environment.

TI  == mlst reveals potentially high-risk international clones of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == objectives: to perform the first multinational enterobacter cloacae clonality study, using the mlst scheme newly developed in japan. methods: the analysis included 195 rectal carriage e. cloacae isolates resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (escs), collected from patients in 12 hospital units across europe and israel. all of the isolates were typed by pfge and 173 isolates were subjected to mlst. esc resistance was analysed phenotypically; genes encoding esbls and carbapenemases were identified by pcr and sequencing. results: mlst distinguished 88 sts, which correlated with the pfge data. pfge was more discriminatory, producing 129 pulsotypes (169 patterns). numerous sts were observed in several countries each. the most widespread were st66, st78, st108 and st114, each having at least 10 isolates from three to five countries, diversified into multiple pulsotypes, with clusters of related isolates in one or more centres. analysis of the sts against the mlst database revealed several epidemic clonal complexes, such as those with central genotypes st74 (including st78) or st114 (including st66). esc resistance was equally related to overexpression of the ampc cephalosporinase and to esbl production. among esbl producers some spreading subclones were identified, including specific st66, st78 and st114 pulsotypes, associated with ctx-m-15 production. several isolates produced carbapenemase vim-1 or kpc-2. conclusions: together with the information available in the mlst database, our results suggest that, like escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, e. cloacae harbours clonal lineages of increased epidemic potential that may be associated with resistance spread.

TI  == expansion of esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae in hospitalized patients: a successful story of international clones (st15, st147, st336) and epidemic plasmids (incr, incfiik).
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize by a multi-level approach extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates other than e. coli from portuguese hospitals. eighty-eight esbl-producing clinical isolates (69 klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 enterobacter cloacae complex, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 enterobacter asburiae, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1 serratia marcescens) recovered from hospitals located in the north (a) or centre (b, c) regions during two time periods (2006-7 and 2010) were analyzed. standard methods were used for bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, esbl characterization, clonal (pfge, mlst) and plasmid (s1-pfge, i-ceui-pfge, replicon typing, hybridization) analysis. isolates produced mostly ctx-m-15 (47%) or shv-12 (30%), and less frequently other shv- (15%; shv-2, -5, -28, -55, -106) or  tem- (9%; tem-10, -24, -199)-types, with marked local and temporal variations. the increase of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv esbl-types observed in hospital a was associated with the amplification of multidrug-resistant (mdr) k. pneumoniae epidemic clones (st15, st147, st336). shv-12 and tem-type esbls were mostly identified in diverse isolates of different enterobacteriaceae species in hospitals b and c in 2006-7. particular plasmid types were linked to blactx-m-15  (incr or non-typeable plasmids), blashv-12 (incr or inchi2), blashv-28/-55/-106 (incfiik1 or incfiik5), blatem-10 (incl/m) or blatem-24 (inca/c), mostly in epidemic clones. in our country, the amplification of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv-type esbl among non-e. coli enterobacteriaceae is linked to international mdr k. pneumoniae clones (st15, st147, st336) and plasmid types (incr, incfiik). furthermore, we highlight the potential of incfiik plasmids (here firstly associated with blashv-2/-28/-55/-106) to disseminate as antibiotic resistance plasmids.

TI  == klebsiella species associated with bovine mastitis in newfoundland.
AB  == klebsiella spp. is a common cause of bovine mastitis, but information regarding its molecular epidemiology is lacking from many parts of the world. on using mass spectrometry and partial sequencing of the rpob gene, it was found that over a one year study, k. variicola and enterobacter cloacae were misidentified as k. pneumoniae in a small number of clinical mastitis (cm) cases from newfoundland. results suggest that the currently used standard biochemical/phenotypic tests lack the sensitivity required to accurately discriminate among the three mentioned gram negative bacteria. in addition, a single strain of k. variicola was associated with cm from one farm in the study as demonstrated by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr. to the best of our knowledge, k. variicola, which is normally found in the environment, has not been isolated previously from milk obtained from cows with cm. therefore, it is possible that k. variicola was  not detected in milk samples in the past due to the inability of standard tests to discriminate it from other klebsiella species.

TI  == chemical composition and antibacterial activity of lavandula coronopifolia essential oil against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the composition of the essential oil (eo) of lavandula coronopifolia from morocco and to evaluate its in vitro antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from clinical infections. the antimicrobial activity was assessed by a broth micro-well dilution method using multiresistant clinical isolates of 11 pathogenic bacteria: klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, klebsiella ornithinolytica, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, hafnia alvei, salmonella spp., acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the main compounds of the oil were carvacrol (48.9%), e-caryophyllene (10.8%) and caryophyllene oxide (7.7%). the oil showed activity against all tested strains with minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranging between 1% and 4%. for most of the strains, the mic value was equivalent to the minimal bactericidal concentration value, indicating a clear bactericidal effect of l. coronopifolia eo.

TI  == highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an iraqi burn care unit.
AB  == objective: in low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. we describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in iraq. methods: we performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between july 2008 and september 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in iraq who developed sepsis. results: in 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% ci 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. the most commonly isolated organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). a high proportion of enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and s. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. for gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. conclusions: burn patients with sepsis in iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class  antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.

TI  == emergence of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria in saint petersburg,  russia.
AB  == the emergence and spread of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria represents a serious public health concern. here we show that of 477 gram-negative isolates collected from 18 hospitals between november 2011 and february 2013 in saint petersburg (russia), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were greater than the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) epidemiological cut-off value of at least one carbapenem antibiotic in 101 isolates (21.2%). the bla(ndm-1) gene was detected by pcr in 17 klebsiella pneumoniae and 1 acinetobacter nosocomialis isolate. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) revealed that all ndm-1-producing k. pneumoniae isolates belonged to sequence type 340 (st340) and harboured genes encoding additional beta-lactamases; presence of the bla(ctx-m-1-like) gene correlated with aztreonam resistance, whilst its absence correlated with susceptibility. the epidemiological situation in saint petersburg can be assessed as regional spread  of ndm-1-producers. the bla(kpc-2) gene was detected in two k. pneumoniae isolates (st258 and st273) and one enterobacter cloacae isolate. two e. cloacae isolates harboured the bla(vim-4) gene, and one k. pneumoniae (st395) isolate harboured the bla(oxa-48) gene. in ndm-1-producers, mics of biapenem were the lowest compared with those of other carbapenems. most isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and polymyxin, except for one k. pneumoniae isolate that was found to be polymyxin-resistant and one e. cloacae isolate that was tigecycline-resistant. only one patient with a urinary tract infection caused by  kpc-2-producing k. pneumoniae had a history of travel abroad (southeast asia). thus, there is an actual threat of the emergence of an alarming endemic situation with ndm-1-producers in saint petersburg.

TI  == microbiological features of kpc-producing enterobacter isolates identified in a u.s. hospital system.
AB  == microbiological data regarding klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing enterobacter spp. are scarce. in this study, 11 unique kpc-producing enterobacter isolates were identified among 44 ertapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacter isolates collected between 2009 and 2013 at a hospital system in western pennsylvania. all cases were healthcare-associated and occurred in medically complex patients. while pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed diverse restriction patterns overall, multilocus sequence  typing identified enterobacter cloacae isolates with sequence types 93 and 171 from 2 hospitals each. the levels of carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations were highly variable. all isolates remained susceptible to colistin and tigecycline, and the majority, to amikacin and doxycycline. a blakpc-carrying incn plasmid conferring trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was identified in 3 of the isolates. spread of blakpc in enterobacter spp. appears to be due to  a combination of plasmid-mediated and clonal processes.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == french regional surveillance program of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli: results from a 2-year period.
AB  == in february 2011, the carb-lr group was created as a sentinel laboratory-based surveillance network to control the emergence of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (cr gnb) in a french southern region. we report the epidemiological results of a 2-year study. all the gram-negative bacilli isolates detected in the different labs (hospital and community settings) of a french southern region and with reduced susceptibility to ertapenem and/or imipenem were characterised with regard to antibiotic resistance, bla genes content, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr) profiles and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). a total of 221 strains were analysed. acinetobacter baumannii was the most prevalent carbapenemase-producing bacteria, with a majority of oxa-23 producers (n = 37). one isolate co-produced oxa-23 and oxa-58  enzymes. klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) (oxa-48 producer: n = 29, kpc producer: n = 1), followed by escherichia coli (oxa-48 producer: n = 8, kpc producer: n = 1) and enterobacter cloacae (oxa-48 producer, n = 1). one isolate of pseudomonas aeruginosa produced a vim-1 carbapenemase. a clonal diversity of carbapenemase-producing k. pneumoniae and e. coli was noted with different mlsts. on the other hand, almost all oxa-23-producing a. baumannii strains belonged to the widespread st2/international clone ii. the link between the detection of cr gnb and a foreign country was less obvious, suggesting the beginning of a local cross-transmission. the number of cr gnb cases in our french southern region has  sharply increased very recently due to the diffusion of oxa-48 producers.

TI  == antibiotic consumption and its influence on the resistance in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the most serious problems in current medicine. an important factor contributing to the growing prevalence of multiresistant bacteria is application of antibiotics. this study aimed at analyzing the development of resistance of enterobacteriaceae to selected beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics in the university hospital olomouc and assessing the effect of selection pressure of these antibiotics. methods: for the period between 1 january 2000 and 31 december 2011, resistance of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, meropenem,  piperacillin/tazobactam, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides was retrospectively studied. for the assessment of selection pressure of antibiotics, a parameter of  defined daily dose in absolute annual consumption (dddatb) based on the atc/ddd classification and in relative annual consumption (rdddatb) as the number of defined daily doses per 100 bed-days was used. the relationship between frequency of strains resistant to a particular antibiotic and antibiotic consumption was assessed by linear regression analysis using spearman's correlation. the level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. results: a total of 113,027 isolates from the enterobacteriaceae family were analyzed. there was a significant effect of selection pressure of the primary antibiotic in the following cases: piperacillin/tazobactam in klebsiella pneumoniae, gentamicin in  klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli and amikacin in escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. also, there was significant correlation between resistance  to ceftazidime and consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam in klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. no relationship was found between consumption of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and resistance to ceftazidime or between fluoroquinolone consumption and resistance to ciprofloxacin. conclusion:  the study showed the effects of both direct and indirect selection pressure on increasing resistance to gentamicin, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. given the fact that no correlation was found between resistance to fluoroquinolones and consumption of either primary or secondary antibiotics, we assume that the increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones is probably due to circulation of resistance genes in the bacterial population and that this resistance was not affected by reduced use of these antibiotics.

TI  == multiresistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae from humans, companion animals and horses in central hesse, germany.
AB  == background: multiresistant gram-negative bacteria producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are an emerging problem in human and veterinary medicine. this study focused on comparative molecular characterization of beta-lactamase and esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates from central hesse in germany. isolates originated from humans, companion animals (dogs and cats) and horses. results: in this study 153 (83.6%) of the human isolates (n = 183) and 163 (91.6%) of the animal isolates (n = 178) were confirmed as esbl producers by pcr  and subsequent sequencing of the pcr amplicons. predominant esbl subtypes in human and animal samples were ctx-m-15 (49.3%) and ctx-m-1 (25.8%) respectively.  subtype blactx-m-2 was found almost exclusively in equine and was absent from human isolates. the carbapenemase oxa-48 was detected in 19 ertapenem-resistant companion animal isolates in this study. the plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance (pmqr) gene aac('6)-ib-cr was the most frequently detected antibiotic- resistance gene present in 27.9% of the human and 36.9% of the animal ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. combinations of two or up to six different resistance genes (penicillinases, esbls and pmqr) were detected in 70% of all isolates investigated. the most frequent species in this study was escherichia coli (74%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (17.5%), and enterobacter cloacae (4.2%). investigation of escherichia coli phylogenetic groups revealed underrepresentation of group b2 within the animal isolates. conclusions: isolates from human, companion animals and horses shared several characteristics regarding presence of esbl, pmqr and combination of different resistance genes. the results indicate active transmission and dissemination of multi-resistant enterobacteriaceae among human and animal populations.

AB  == treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from  vietnam. this study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in vietnam during 2009-2011. a total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends. antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. among the species collected, escherichia coli (48.1% esbl-positive) and klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% esbl-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. ertapenem mic90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/ml and remained unchanged for esbl-positive isolates. imipenem mic90 values were also the same for all isolates and esbl-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/ml, respectively. ertapenem mic90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/ml, respectively. analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that ctx-m variants, particularly ctx-m-27 and ctx-m-15, were the predominant enzymes. high resistance rates in vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout asia and globally.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility and distribution of beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae causing intra-abdominal infections in north america 2010-2011.
AB  == the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends has been monitoring the  activity of antimicrobials indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections since 2004. this report documents the in vitro activity of several recommended antimicrobials against 3449 gram-negative bacilli isolated from the 30 and 25 participating sites in north america in 2010-2011, respectively, and characterizes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) identified in esbl-positive and ertapenem-non-susceptible isolates of enterobacteriaceae. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and morganella morgannii were the most common species isolated. the incidence of beta-lactamase production was 8.8% and 8.9% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, respectively. overall the most active antimicrobials were amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, although beta-lactamase production reduced the activity of most agents. characterization of beta-lactamase genes determined that bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), bla(ampc), and bla(kpc) were commonly found in most beta-lactamase-positive isolates.

TI  == eliciting antibiotics active against the eskape pathogens in a collection of actinomycetes isolated from mountain soils.
AB  == the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. in recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the himalaya and qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against mdr pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes  were identified - predominantly streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the mdr clinical isolates referred to as eskape pathogens: enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or enterobacter cloacae. antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not  described previously. our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that  have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific  pathogen.

TI  == [the genotype and epidemiological feature of the enterobacteriaceae carrying carbapenemase in china].
AB  == objective: to analyze the genotype and molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae. method: a total of 201 carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 14 hospitals in 11 cities. the mics of 14 antimicrobial drugs were detected using agar dilution method. phenotypes of carbapenemase were screened using modified hodge test and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (edta) test. drug resistance genes were screened using pcr method. the strains carrying carbapenem resistance genes were  confirmed by conjugation test. homology analysis was carried out using pulsed-field gel electro-phoresis (pfge) method and the epidemiological correlation is analyzed based on the multilocus sequence typing (mlst) method in  order to study the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae. results: fifty-three strains among 201 carbapenem-insensitive enterobacteriaceae were detected positive carbapenem-resistant genes, among which included 33 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 citrobacter freundii, 6 escherichia coli and 5 enterobacter cloacae. among the 53 strains, 43 were from beijing, 6 strains from hangzhou, 3 strains from nanjing and one from fuzhou. resistance genes-harboring plasmids were successfully transferred from 28 of 53 strains to escherichia coli ec600. the pfge spectrum showed that 33 klebsiella pneumoniae were classified into three types, 9 citrobacter freundii classified into four types, 5 enterobacter cloacae classified into four types, while 6 escherichia coli were the same type. based on the results of mlst test, 29 klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing kpc-2 type carbapenemase were all st11, while among  the four klebsiella pneumonia carrying imp-4 carbapenem resistant gene, three strains were st876, one was st147. conclusions: carbapenem-resistant genes were detected only in hospitals from beijing, hangzhou, nanjing and fuzhou, and type kpc-2 was the most common, followed by imp-4 and imp-8. high homology of resistant strains could be related to horizontal transfer of carbapenemase genes, which should cause great concern.

TI  == mix and match of kpc-2 encoding plasmids in enterobacteriaceae-comparative genomics.
AB  == we performed comparative sequence analysis of 3 blakpc-2 encoding plasmids to examine evolution of these plasmids and their dissemination. we found that all of them have an incn replicon with a newly determined incn plasmid sequence type (st), st15. the 2 klebsiella pneumoniae (kpn) plasmids also harbor an incf2a1-b1- replicon. the blakpc-2 is located in the tn4401c transposon with a newly discovered mutation in the p2 promoter. screening of the 27 additional blakpc-2 carrying plasmids from enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli (ec), and k. pneumoniae showed that: all kpn and ec plasmids are incn plasmids belonging to st15; 4/7 kpn and 1/6 ec plasmids contain an additional incf2a1-b1- replicon; all enterobacter plasmids belong to neither incn nor incf2a1-b1- replicon plasmids; 6/7 kpn and 2/5 ec plasmids carry the mutated p2 promoter. study of the blakpc-2  environment, transposon, pmlst, and inc group suggests transposon and plasmid inter- and intra-species dissemination and evolution.

TI  == pathogen characteristics reveal novel antibacterial approaches for interstitial lung disease.
AB  == interstitial lung disease (ild) is a clinical disorder associated with changes of lung structure. concurrent infection is a serious complication and one of the major factors that exacerbates ild. pathogen screening is a critical step in early diagnosis and proper treatment of ild with secondary infection. here we analyzed distribution and drug susceptibility of pathogens isolated from hospitalized ild patients from january, 2007 to december, 2008 and compared them  to bacterial drug resistance data in chinet during the same period. the main specimens were from sputum culture, lavage fluid culture, lung biopsy tissue culture, and pleural effusion culture and bacterial or fungal cultures were performed on these specimens accordingly. drug susceptibility was tested for positive bacterial cultures using disk diffusion (kirby-bauer method) and e test  strips in which results were determined based on the criteria of clsi (2007). a total of 371 pathogen strains from ild patients, including 306 bacterial strains  and 65 fungal strains were isolated and cultured. five main bacterial strains and their distribution were as follows: klebsiella pneumoniae (31.7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.6%), acinetobacter (12.7%), enterobacter cloacae (8.2%), and staphylococcus aureus (7.8%). the results showed that ild patients who had anti-infection treatment tended to have gram-negative bacteria, whether they acquired an infection in the hospital or elsewhere. drug resistance screening indicated that aminoglycosides and carbapenems had lower antibiotic resistance rates. in addition, we found that the usage of immunosuppressants was associated  with the increased infection rate and number of pathogens that were isolated. in  conclusion, aminoglycosides and carbapenems may be selected as a priority for secondary infection to control ild progression. meanwhile, the use of anti-mrsa/mrcns drugs may be considered for staphylococcus infection.

TI  == diversity of carbapenemases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae in croatia--the results of a multicentre study.
AB  == since the first carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae strain was isolated in 2008, enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility to one or more carbapenems have emerged sporadically in different geographical regions in croatia. these observations gave rise to a multicenter study on carbapenem resistance in enterobacteriaceae from croatia. fifty-seven carbapenem-non-susceptible strains of enterobacteriaceae were collected during 2011-2012 from four large hospital centres in croatia. overall, 36 strains produced vim-1 beta-lactamase, three produced ndm-1, and one produced kpc-2. a high degree of clonal relatedness was observed in enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains, in contrast to k. pneumoniae strains. blavim genes were located within class1 integron which contained genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides (aaca4 ). the study found  strong association between blavim and qnrb6 and between blandm and qnra6 genes.

TI  == carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary hospital in madrid, spain: high percentage of colistin resistance among vim-1-producing klebsiella pneumoniae st11 isolates.
AB  == here we describe the carbapenemase genes, genetic relatedness and antimicrobial susceptibility data of 123 carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) clinical isolates recovered from 2010 to 2012, comprising klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 79), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 13), serratia marcescens (n = 14), enterobacter cloacae (n = 12), enterobacter asburiae (n = 4) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1). vim-1 was the most common carbapenemase (n = 101) followed by kpc-2 (n = 19), oxa-48 (n = 2) and imp-22 (n = 1). among the k. pneumoniae isolates, nine sequence types (sts) were identified but two clones were dominant: st11 (54/79) containing mainly vim-1-producing isolates; and st101 (13/79) constituted by kpc-2-producing strains. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) showed a higher  genetic diversity among the remaining enterobacteriaceae. amikacin and fosfomycin were the most active agents with 82.9% and 80.5% susceptibility, respectively. non-susceptibility to tigecycline was detected in 36.5% of strains. overall, colistin resistance was 24.7% and was as high as 47% in enterobacter spp. an increase in colistin resistance from 13.5% to 31.7% was observed among k. pneumoniae isolates during the study period. resistance was focused on st11 since 83.3% of colistin-resistant strains belonged to this clone. the high level of colistin resistance observed in this study is worrying with respect to the already limited therapeutic options for infections caused by multidrug-resistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == fosfomycin susceptibility in carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae from germany.
AB  == due to the increase in multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae, the interest in older antimicrobial agents, like fosfomycin, has increased. in this study, we used agar dilution for testing susceptibilities to fosfomycin in a collection of  107 carbapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates, of which 80 produced various types of carbapenemases, including kpc, vim, ndm, and oxa-48. overall, 78% of the strains had fosfomycin mics of </= 32 mg/liter and were thus considered to be susceptible according to the current eucast breakpoint. the mic50 and mic90 were 8 mg/liter and 512 mg/liter, respectively. escherichia coli  strains had significantly lower fosfomycin mics than the klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae strains. furthermore, comparisons of the susceptibility  testing methods, like etest and disk diffusion, were performed against agar dilution as the reference method. essential agreement between etest and agar dilution was 78.9%, and categorical agreement between the two methods was 92.5%,  with 20% very major errors and 2.6% major errors. disk diffusion was studied with 50-mug and 200-mug fosfomycin disks, but no inhibition zone breakpoint that reduced very major and major errors to an acceptable level was found. etest and disk diffusion showed poor agreement with fosfomycin agar dilution.

TI  == enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones in fresh culinary herbs imported from southeast asia.
AB  == since multidrug resistant bacteria are frequently reported from southeast asia, our study focused on the occurrence of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in fresh imported herbs from thailand, vietnam and malaysia. samples were collected from fresh culinary herbs imported from southeast asia in which esbl-suspected isolates were obtained by selective culturing. analysis included identification by maldi-tof mass spectrometry, susceptibility testing, xbai-pfge, microarray, pcr and sequencing of specific esbl genes, pcr based replicon typing (pbrt) of plasmids and southern blot hybridization. in addition, the quinolone resistance genotype was characterized by screening for plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (pmqr) genes and mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (qrdr)  of gyra and parc. the study encompassed fifty samples of ten batches of culinary  herbs (5 samples per batch) comprising nine different herb variants. the herbs originated from thailand (water morning glory, acacia and betel leaf), vietnam (parsley, asian pennywort, houttuynia leaf and mint) and malaysia (holy basil and parsley). by selective culturing 21 cefotaxime resistant enterobacteriaceae were  retrieved. array analysis revealed 18 isolates with esbl genes and one isolate with solely non-esbl beta-lactamase genes. mutations in the ampc promoter region  were determined in two isolates with pcr and sequencing. the isolates were identified as klebsiella pneumoniae (n=9), escherichia coli (n=6), enterobacter cloacae complex (n=5) and enterobacter spp. (n=1). all isolates tested were multidrug resistant. variants of ctx-m enzymes were predominantly found followed  by shv enzymes. pmqr genes (including aac(6')-1b-cr, qnrb and qnrs) were also frequently detected. in almost all cases esbl and quinolone resistance genes were located on the same plasmid. imported fresh culinary herbs from southeast asia are a potential source for contamination of food with multidrug resistant bacteria. because these herbs are consumed without appropriate heating, transfer  to human bacteria cannot be excluded.

TI  == systematic metabolic engineering of escherichia coli for high-yield production of fuel bio-chemical 2,3-butanediol.
AB  == the production of biofuels by recombinant escherichia coli is restricted by the toxicity of the products. 2,3-butanediol (2,3-bd), a platform and fuel bio-chemical with low toxicity to microbes, could be a promising alternative for  biofuel production. however, the yield and productivity of 2,3-bd produced by recombinant e. coli strains are not sufficient for industrial scale fermentation. in this work, the production of 2,3-bd by recombinant e. coli strains was optimized by applying a systematic approach. 2,3-bd biosynthesis gene clusters were cloned from several native 2,3-bd producers, including bacillus subtilis, bacillus licheniformis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and enterobacter cloacae, inserted into the expression vector pet28a, and compared for 2,3-bd synthesis. the recombinant strain e. coli bl21/petpt7-ecabc, carrying  the 2,3-bd pathway gene cluster from enterobacter cloacae, showed the best ability to synthesize 2,3-bd. thereafter, expression of the most efficient gene cluster was optimized by using different promoters, including pt7, ptac, pc, and  pabc. e. coli bl21/pet-rabc with pabc as promoter was superior in 2,3-bd synthesis. on the basis of the results of biomass and extracellular metabolite profiling analyses, fermentation conditions, including ph, agitation speed, and aeration rate, were optimized for the efficient production of 2,3-bd. after fed-batch fermentation under the optimized conditions, 73.8g/l of 2,3-bd was produced by using e. coli bl21/pet-rabc within 62h. the values of both yield and  productivity of 2,3-bd obtained with the optimized biological system are the highest ever achieved with an engineered e. coli strain. in addition to the 2,3-bd production, the systematic approach might also be used in the production of other important chemicals through recombinant e. coli strains.

TI  == a bioinformatics approach to the determination of genes involved in endophytic behavior in burkholderia spp.
AB  == the vast majority of plants harbor endophytic bacteria that colonize a portion of the plant's interior tissues without harming the plant. like plant pathogens, endophytes gain entry into their plants hosts through various mechanisms. bacterial endophytes display a broad range of symbiotic interactions with their host plants. the molecular bases of these plant-endophyte interactions are currently not fully understood. in the present study, a set of genes possibly responsible for endophytic behavior for genus burkholderia was predicted and then compared and contrasted with a number (nine endophytes from different genera) of  endophytes by comparative genome analysis. the nine endophytes included burkholderia phytofirmans psjn, burkholderia spp. strain jk006, azospirillum lipoferum 4b, enterobacter cloacae enhku01, klebsiella pneumoniae 342, pseudomonas putida w619, enterobacter spp. 638, azoarcus spp. bh72, and serratia  proteamaculans 568. from the genomes of the analyzed bacterial strains, a set of  bacterial genes orthologs was identified that are predicted to be involved in determining the endophytic behavior of burkholderia spp. the genes and their possible functions were then investigated to establish a potential connection between their presence and the role they play in bacterial endophytic behavior. nearly all of the genes identified by this bioinformatics procedure encode function previously suggested in other studies to be involved in endophytic behavior.

TI  == emergence of carbapenemaseproducing klebsiella pneumoniae of sequence type 258 in michigan, usa.
AB  == the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) in our hospital increased beginning in 2009. we aimed to study the clinical and molecular epidemiology of these emerging isolates. we performed a retrospective review of all adult patients with clinical cultures confirmed as cpe by positive  modified hodge test from 5/2009- 5/2010 at the university of michigan health system (umhs). clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. available cpe isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing of the 16s rrna encoding gene and bla kpc locus. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) was used to characterize klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. twenty six unique cpe isolates were obtained from 25 adult patients. the majority were klebsiella pneumoniae (n=17). other isolates included k. oxytoca (n=3), citrobacter freundii (n=2), enterobacter cloacae (n=2), enterobacter aerogenes (n=1) and escherichia coli (n=1). molecular characterization of 19 available cpe  isolates showed that 13 (68%) carried the kpc-3 allele and 6 (32%) carried the kpc-2 allele. among 14 available k. pneumoniae strains, 12 (86%) carried the kpc-3 allele and belonged to a common lineage, sequence type (st) 258. the other  2 (14%) k. pneumoniae isolates carried the kpc-2 allele and belonged to two unique sts. among these st 258 strains, 67% were isolated from patients with prior exposures to health care settings outside of our institution. in contrast,  all cpe isolates carrying the kpc-2 allele and all non st 258 cpe isolates had acquisition attributable to our hospital. molecular epidemiology of carbapenemase producing k. pneumoniae suggests that kpc-3 producing k. pneumoniae isolates of a common lineage, sequence type (st 258), are emerging in our hospital. while st 258 is a dominant sequence type throughout the united states, this study is the first to report its presence in michigan.

AB  == the widespread multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae pose a serious therapeutic  challenge. colistin and tigecycline are potential antimicrobial agents for treating infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae. we evaluated the in-vitro activity of colistin sulfate against 253 esbl producers isolated from patients admitted to a medical center in southern taiwan (escherichia coli, n = 82; klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 102; enterobacter cloacae, n = 34; and serratia marcescens, n = 35). colistin showed promising in-vitro activity against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae, but not s. marcescens. one esbl-producing k. pneumoniae strain with resistance to carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem) was selected for time-killing studies. a combination of colistin and tigecycline showed synergism, but there was an inoculum effect. in conclusion, colistin was active against most esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, and a combination of colistin with tigecycline was synergistic against some highly resistant strains, even those with carbapenem resistance.

TI  == isolation and identification of enterobacteriaceae from raw horsemeat intended for human consumption (basashi).
AB  == the status of enterobacteriaceae contamination was investigated in a total of 131 samples of raw horsemeat (basashi) intended for human consumption purchased from  a general meat shop or by mail-order from october 2012 to december 2013. the bacteria were isolated from 105 of the 112 samples (93.8%). prominent differences in the isolation rate due to the place of manufacture/sale or by the cut of the meat were not observed. moreover, in a comparison between domestic (92.6%) and imported (100%) samples, the isolation rate was slightly higher in the imported samples. when enterobacteriaceae isolated from raw horsemeat was identified, it was highly diverse, with 14 species identified in total. from among these species, hafnia alvei was the most common, with 33 strains (19.8%),followed by 27 strains (16.2%) of klebsiella pneumoniae and 26 strains (15.6%) of enterobacter cloacae, indicating that these three species were dominant. a trend was observed, with the dominant strain differing depending on the place of manufacture/sale or  the cut of the meat. h. alvei was isolated at an especially high frequency from imported samples. an investigation was carried out regarding raw horsemeat intended for human consumption from yamanashi prefecture and canada, regularly purchased from one store in kanagawa prefecture. enterobacteriaceae were isolated during five of nine (55.6% trials, in which the isolated bacteria were h. alvei,  k. pneumoniae, etc. moreover, they were isolated at a very high isolation rate of seven among 10 trials for the canadian meat, and h. alvei was the most commonly isolated bacteria. accordingly, when an investigation was carried out regarding the differences in the strain level in the six isolates of h. alvei periodically  isolated from raw horsemeat from canada by the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) pattern using a restriction enzyme, sfii, there was a possibility that these were the same h-38 strain (november 2013) and h-64 strain (april 2014) as well as the same h-104 strain (july 2014) and h-131 strain (december 2014). as mentioned above, it has been demonstrated that a variety of enterobacteriaceae were isolated from raw horsemeat (basashi) intended for human consumption, and at a high frequency. moreover, based on the fact that the same species or strain was chronologically isolated, the possibility of contamination by the same contamination source at different times was suggested.

TI  == the use of colistin in critically ill children in a pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  == background: colistin is active against most multidrug-resistant, aerobic gram-negative bacteria. because of the reported nephrotoxicity during the first years of use of colistin, there were concerns of its use in pediatrics where there was limited experience the aim of this study is to document the clinical characteristics and outcomes of use of colistin in pediatric patients at a pediatric intensive care unit in turkey. methods: we reviewed the medical and laboratory records of 29 critically ill children who were treated with colistin for 38 courses between january 2011 and december 2011 at the department of pediatric intensive care unit in ankara university medical school, turkey. results: the median age was 17 months (range 3-217 months). male-to-female ratio  was 1:1.37. ventilator-associated pneumonia (21 courses) was the leading diagnosis followed by catheter-related blood stream infection (6 courses), bacteremia (4 courses), ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection, peritonitis and pneumonia (1 course). the most commonly isolated microorganisms were acinetobacter baumanni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and enterobacter cloacae. two colistin  formulations were used. colimycin (kocak farma) was used in 21 colistin treatment episodes. the median dosage of colistin in this group was 5.0 mg/kg/d (2.3-5.6 mg/kg/d). colomycin (forest laboratories) was used in 17 colistin treatment episodes. the median dosage of colistin in the second group was 75,000 international unit/kg/d (50,000-80,000 international unit/kg/d). thirty colistin  treatment episodes (79%) had a good or partial clinical response and 8 (21%) had  a poor clinical response. of the 8 colistin treatment episodes with poor clinical response, 3 were in the colimycin group and 5 were in the colomycin group. ten patients died. there was no evidence of neurotoxicity in this study. nephrotoxicity was observed in 1 patient but was not attributed to colistin because the patient had multiorgan failure at the same time. conclusions: this study in a small cohort of patients suggests that the use of colistin in severe nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria is well-tolerated and efficacious.

TI  == characterization of novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (shv-167 and act-16) associated with new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 harbouring isolates from neonates in india.
AB  == neonatal sepsis due to carbapenem-resistant bacteria is difficult to treat due to limited therapeutic options. the detection of the new carbapenemase new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) from neonates has further complicated the situation (roy et al., 2011a). the potent metallo-beta-lactamase ndm-1 efficiently hydrolyses all classes of beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems) and is also associated with multiple determinants that enable the bacteria to become resistant to other antibiotic classes (nordmann et al., 2011). in the presence of ndm-1 other beta-lactamases may go unobserved because of the spectrum of activity of ndm-1 against all beta-lactam antibiotics. thus, under the canopy of the ndm-1 these beta-lactamases also get the opportunity to spread. this communication reports association of two novel beta-lactamases, shv-type beta-lactamase (shv-167) and ampc-type beta-lactamase (act-16), in two ndm-1-carrying enterobacteriaceae isolated from the blood of two septicaemic neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit.

TI  == risk factors associated with preoperative fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in liver transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to identify risk factors associated with pre-transplant fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae in liver transplant recipients. patients and  methods: over a 3-year period (january 2009-december 2011), 317 patients who underwent liver transplantation were screened preoperatively for fecal carriage of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae. risk factors for fecal carriage were investigated by univariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression. results: of the 317 patients screened, 50 (15.7%) harbored an esbl-producing isolate. previous infection with an esbl-producing organism had developed during the last  6 months in 20% of fecal carriers versus in none of the non-carriers. other variables associated with fecal carriage were a model for end-stage liver disease score >/=25, pre-transplant stay in the intensive care unit >/=48 h, hospital stay >/=10 days in the last 6 months, a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp), exposure to a beta-lactam agent in the last month, and prophylaxis with norfloxacin. independent predictors of fecal carriage in the multivariate logistic regression model were exposure to a beta-lactam agent in the month preceding transplantation (odds ratio [or] = 7.8, confidence interval [ci] = 4-15.5, p < 0.001), and a history of sbp (or = 2.4, ci = 1.1-4.9, p = 0.02). conclusions: previous infection with an esbl-producing isolate, recent exposure to a beta-lactam agent, and a history of sbp are risk factors for preoperative fecal carriage of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in liver transplant recipients. patients at risk of fecal carriage should receive intraoperative prophylaxis and, when necessary, empiric postoperative antimicrobial treatment that includes coverage for these organisms.

TI  == [diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  == objective: the catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (bf) on the surface of the implanted material. the majority of  natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. however, there always  only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. the aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of bf on endotracheal tube (ett), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. method: thirty-five etts were obtained from 26 neonates on  mechanical ventilator (from october 2012 to march 2013) in department of neonatology of children's hospital. among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. dgge profiling of 16s rdna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. ta cloning kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ett-bf. result: the mean bands of 35 etts cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16s rdna pcr-dgge, and the mean shanon-wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. the 16 etts were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. the indwelling days of 6/7 patients' etts increased, the shanon-siener  indexes were decreased. among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different shanon-siener indexes. the result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained klebsiella sp., 28 cases (80%) had pseudomonas sp., 27 cases (77%) had streptococcus sp., and 32 cases (91%) had uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species  were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) klebsiella sp. and 22/27(82%) streptococcus sp. were accompanied by pseudomonas sp.. there were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the etts on which klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. conclusion: the diversity of microbiota in bf on ett was confirmed. 16s rdna pcr-dgge could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. klebsiella, pseudomonas and streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ett-bf, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of bf.

TI  == change of antibiotic susceptibility testing guidelines from clsi to eucast: influence on cumulative hospital antibiograms.
AB  == objective: we studied whether the change in antibiotic susceptibility testing (ast) guidelines from clsi to eucast influenced cumulative antibiograms in a tertiary care hospital in switzerland. methods: antibiotic susceptibilities of non-duplicate isolates collected within a one-year period before (period a) and after (period b) changing ast interpretation from clsi 2009 to eucast 1.3 (2011)  guidelines were analysed. in addition, period b isolates were reinterpreted according to the clsi 2009, clsi 2013 and eucast 3.1 (2013) guidelines. results:  the majority of species/drug combinations showed no differences in susceptibility rates comparing periods a and b. however, in some gram-negative bacilli, decreased susceptibility rates were observed when comparing clsi 2009 with eucast 1.3 within period b: escherichia coli / cefepime, 95.8% (clsi 2009) vs. 93.1% (eucast 1.3), p=0.005; enterobacter cloacae / cefepime, 97.0 (clsi 2009) vs. 90.5% (eucast 1.3), p=0.012; pseudomonas aeruginosa / meropenem, 88.1% (clsi 2009) vs. 78.3% (eucast 1.3), p=0.002. these differences were still evident when  comparing susceptibility rates according to the clsi 2013 guideline with eucast 3.1 guideline. for p. aeruginosa and imipenem, a trend towards a lower antibiotic susceptibility rate in icus compared to general wards turned into a significant difference after the change to eucast: 87.9% vs. 79.8%, p=0.08 (clsi 2009) and 86.3% vs. 76.8%, p=0.048 (eucast 1.3). conclusions: the change of ast guidelines  from clsi to eucast led to a clinically relevant decrease of susceptibility rates in cumulative antibiograms for defined species/drug combinations, particularly in those with considerable differences in clinical susceptibility breakpoints between the two guidelines.

AB  == hymenochirin-1b (iklspetkdn(10)lkkvlkgaik(20)gaiavakmv.nh2) is a cationic, amphipathic, alpha-helical, host-defense peptide, first isolated from skin secretions of the congo clawed frog hymenochirus boettgeri (pipidae). structure-activity relationships were investigated by synthesizing analogs in which the pro(5), glu(6) and asp(9) on the hydrophilic face of the alpha-helix are substituted by one or more l-lysine or d-lysine residues. although replacement with l-lysine generates analogs with increased antimicrobial potency  against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (up to 8-fold), the peptides are more hemolytic. increasing the cationicity of hymenochirin-1b while  reducing the helicity by substitutions with d-lysine generates analogs that are between 2 and 8 fold more potent than the native peptide and are equally or less  hemolytic. [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b represents a candidate for drug development as it shows high potency against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and a range of gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic in the range 0.8-3.1 mum) and ndm-1 carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii (mic in the range 3.1-6.25 mum), and low hemolytic activity (lc50=302 mum). [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b, at a concentration of 2.5 mum, significantly (p<0.05) stimulates the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear  cells but is without significant effect on production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and il-17.

TI  == early-onset sepsis in a neonatal intensive care unit in beni suef, egypt: bacterial isolates and antibiotic resistance pattern.
AB  == purpose: to identify the frequency of bacterial isolates in early-onset neonatal  sepsis (eons) and their antimicrobial resistance pattern. methods: a retrospective study of eons was conducted at the beni suef university hospital from september 2008 to september 2012. a case of eons was defined as an infant who had clinical signs of infection or who was born to a mother with risk factors for infection, and in whom blood culture obtained within 72 hours of life grew a  bacterial pathogen. results: of 673 neonates screened, there were 138 positive blood cultures (20.5%) (confirmed eons). of the recovered isolates, 86.2% were gram-negative pathogens. klebsiella pneumoniae (42.8%), enterobacter cloacae (22.5%), and escherichia coli (13.8%) were the commonest isolated organisms. the  most common gram-positive microorganism was staphylococcus aureus accounting for  only 12 isolates (8.7%). all klebsiella isolates and 93% of enterobacter isolates were resistant to ampicillin. gram-negative pathogens had the maximum overall sensitivity to imipenem, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin; whereas, gram-positive isolates were most susceptible to vancomycin, imipenem, and piperacillin. conclusion: k. pneumoniae was the predominant causative bacteria of eons followed by e. cloacae and e. coli. there was a high resistance to ampicillin. imipenem had the maximum overall activity against the causative bacteria. continuous surveillance is needed to monitor the changing epidemiology of pathogens and antibiotic sensitivity.

TI  == acquired carbapenemases in enterobactericeae in singapore, 1996-2012.
AB  == aims: to characterise carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cre) isolated in singapore. methods: carbapenemase genes and their flanking regions were amplified and sequenced by pcr. isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multi-locus sequence typing. plasmids bearing carbapenemase genes were sized by s1 nuclease digestion, southern blotting, and dna hybridisation with appropriate probes. transfer of these plasmids was attempted by conjugation and transformation. successfully transferred plasmids were characterised by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) replicon typing and restriction  digestion. results: isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter species carried a variety of carbapenemase genes including blaimp-1, blaimp-4, blandm-1, blandm-7, blaoxa-181, blaoxa-48 and blakpc-2. apart from k. pneumoniae with blaoxa-181, and some k. pneumoniae with blandm-1, the other isolates were not clonal. however there appears to be some spread of plasmids with blaimp-1, blandm-1,blakpc-2, and blaoxa-48. conclusions:  the number of isolates of cre has increased in singapore, especially since 2010.  there is a diversity of carbapenemase types that reflects the geographical proximity of other countries with cre.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-negative aerobic bacilli from intra-abdominal pathogens to antimicrobial agents collected in the united states during 2011.
AB  == objectives: during 2011, a total of 1442 gram-negative pathogens from intra-abdominal infections were collected as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) from 19 hospital sites within the united  states. susceptibility to ertapenem and comparators and molecular analysis of ertapenem resistant isolates was performed. methods: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase esbl (esbl) isolates were determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute's recommended phenotypic test. isolates were identified to the species level, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using custom microscan dehydrated broth microdilution panels esbls and carbapenemases were characterized using the check-points microarray. strain typing of klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by rep-pcr on the diversilab system. results: the majority of isolates were escherichia coli (36%), k. pneumoniae (18.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%) and enterobacter cloacae (8.4%). incidence of esbl-positive isolates was 12.7%, 9.7%, 3.6% and 3.1% for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. against the majority of isolates and species tested, the most active antibiotics  were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem, with the carbapenems being the most active in vitro, including against esbl-positive isolates of e. coli. all other antibiotics exhibited diminished activity. against k. pneumoniae, the carbapenems were notably less active against esbl-positive isolates though their activity against this sub-population was still the highest of all antibiotics tested; however, 41.1% (14 of 34) of the phenotypically esbl-positive k. pneumoniae co-produced a carbapenemase (kpc2 or kpc3), and >90% of the isolates producing only an esbl remained susceptible to ertapenem. conclusions: further monitoring of susceptibility of intra-abdominal isolates is warranted due to limited therapeutic options available to physicians.

TI  == molecular characterization of klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing isolates in southern brazil.
AB  == carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae have been frequently reported worldwide.  they represent a serious concern because of the limited therapeutic options. the  aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of 14 klebsiella  pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc) producers among 345 clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems recovered from 11 separate hospitals in southern brazil. the blakpc-2 gene was detected in 14 isolates (4 %): six enterobacter cloacae, five k. pneumoniae and three serratia marcescens. most of these isolates exhibited high-level resistance against beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, while the most active drugs were polymyxin b and  amikacin. genetic environment analysis, based on the classical tn4401 structure,  revealed six distinct platforms. plasmids carrying blakpc-2 were not typable and  most were approximately 20 kb. only kpc carbapenemases were found among the isolates studied, highlighting the local relevance of these enzymes in acquired resistance to carbapenems in enterobacteriaceae. our results contribute to the understanding of carbapenem resistance in enterobacteriaceae and to the molecular characterization of kpc-2-producing isolates in brazil.

TI  == enterobacter and klebsiella species isolated from fresh vegetables marketed in valencia (spain) and their clinically relevant resistances to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  == occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic or commensal enterobacteria in marketed agricultural foodstuffs may contribute to their incorporation into the food chain and constitutes an additional food safety concern. in this work, we have determined the clinically relevant resistances to 11 common chemotherapeutic agents in enterobacter and klebsiella isolates from fresh vegetables from various sources (supermarkets and greengrocers' shops in valencia, spain). a total of 96  isolates were obtained from 160 vegetables analyzed (50% positive samples): 68 enterobacter isolates (59 e. cloacae, two e. aerogenes, two e. cancerogenus, one  e. gergoviae, and four e. sakazakii, currently cronobacter spp.), and 28 klebsiella isolates (19 k. oxytoca and 9 k. pneumoniae). only seven isolates were susceptible to all agents tested, and no resistances to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol were detected. most isolates were  resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (74 [58 enterobacter and 16 klebsiella]) or to ampicillin (80 [55/25]). other resistances were less frequent: nitrofurantoin (13 isolates [12/1]), tetracycline (6 [5/1]), co-trimoxazole (3 [3/0]), cefotaxime (1 [1/0]), and streptomycin (2 [1/1]). multiresistant isolates to two (56 [41/15]), three (10 e. cloacae isolates), four (one e. cloacae and one k. pneumoniae isolate), and five (two e. cloacae isolates) chemotherapeutic agents were also detected. the presence of potential pathogens points to marketed fresh produce, which often is eaten raw, as a risk factor for consumer health. in addition, these results support the usefulness of these bacterial species as indicators of the spreading of antibiotic resistances into the environment, particularly in the food chain, and suggest their role as carriers of resistance  determinants from farms to consumers, which may constitute an additional "silent" food safety concern. therefore, there is a need to improve the hygienic quality of marketed fresh vegetables, from better methods to prevent contamination in the farms to the use of sanitizing practices at home.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == culture proven newborn sepsis with a special emphasis on late onset sepsis caused by enterobacteriaceae in a level iii neonatal care unit in astana, kazakhstan.
AB  == background: newborn sepsis is one of the major public health concerns worldwide.  also in our neonatal care unit, it is one of the major problems and especially infections with enterobacteriaceae were noted to pose an increasing problem in the last years. methods: data collection was done retrospectively for 2011. early onset sepsis was defined as having a positive blood culture within 72 h and late  onset sepsis after 72 h of delivery. results: out of 599 patients being admitted, 58 newborns were assessed having a neonatal sepsis. of these 58 newborns with sepsis, 11 were diagnosed within 72 h post delivery (early onset) and 47 were diagnosed after 72 h post delivery (late onset). the percentage of enterobacteriaceae causing late onset sepsis was 57.5 %. among these, klebsiella  pneumoniae could be isolated in 29.8 %, enterobacter cloacae in 12.8 %, enterobacter aerogenes in 8.5 %, and escherichia coli in 6.4 % of late onset sepsis. majority of the strains showed a resistance to antibiotics used in empiric treatment. antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment from birth until the onset of late onset sepsis could be analyzed in 20 out of 27 newborns with late onset sepsis caused by enterobacteriaceae. a regimen of empirical antibiotic treatment  containing aminopenicillin and/or gentamicin was administered in 16 newborns and  that of cephalosporin in 14 out of 20 newborns for at least 5 days before onset of sepsis. conclusions: the association of empiric long-term antibiotic treatment and the high number of late onset sepsis with often multiresistant enterobacteriaceae might be causal and urges for a change in general antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment in newborns admitted to the neonatal care unit of our hospital.

TI  == relationship between the distribution of cefepime minimum inhibitory concentrations and detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production among clinically important enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from patients in intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2007.
AB  == background: the data on susceptibility of important cephalosporins against four enterobacteriaceae members producing potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) collected from taiwanese intensive care units are lacking. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime were determined using agar dilution method, against escherichia coli (n = 344), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 359), enterobacter cloacae (n = 103), and proteus mirabilis (n = 78). susceptibilities of these isolates to three cephalosporins were assessed according to mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) in 2013. the double-disk synergy test using disks containing cefepime (30 mug) with or without clavulanate (10 mug) was applied to  confirm production of esbl for isolates with cephalosporin mic >/= 2 mug/ml. results: a total of 175 isolates were verified as esbl producers. the rates of cefepime susceptibility among the esbl-producing isolates, according to clsi (eucast) criteria, were 56.7% (22.4%) for e. coli, 61.3% (12.0%) for k. pneumoniae, 57.9% (31.6%) for e. cloacae, and 71.4% (7.1%) for p. mirabilis. using different cefepime mic breakpoints (mics >/= 16 mug/ml recommended by clsi  criteria and >/= 2 mug/ml by eucast criteria) to define nonsusceptibility, we found that both criteria were poorer at predicting esbl producers among k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae than among the other two species. in addition, we also  found that the cefepime mic level of 1.0 mug/ml best distinguished non-esbl- from esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae. conclusion: to detect esbls, clsi should revise the cefepime mic breakpoint against enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == this study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (utis). urine samples from patients with utis (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. the urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. bacterial species were identified by a combination of  bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the bact-ist microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. the most common seven species of bacteria in the study included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection"  method using capillary electrophoresis (ce). each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. the mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (r(2)=0.99). the effect of urine composition on ce results was also investigated. the results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (wbcs) and red blood cells (rbcs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. the results demonstrated that the bacteria in  urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using ce. the "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from utis.

TI  == intercontinental spread of oxa-48 beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae over a 11-year period, 2001 to 2011.
AB  == oxa-48 beta-lactamase producers are emerging as an important threat mostly in the mediterranean area. we report here the molecular epidemiology of a collection of  oxa-48 beta-lactamase-positive enterobacterial isolates (n=107) recovered from european and north-african countries between january 2001 and december 2011. this collection included 67 klebsiella pneumoniae, 24 escherichia coli and 10 enterobacter cloacae. using the eucast breakpoints, ninety-eight isolates (91.6%) were of intermediate susceptibility or resistant to ertapenem, whereas 66% remained susceptible to imipenem. seventy-five per cent of the isolates co-produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, most frequently ctx-m-15 (77.5%). susceptibility testing to non-beta-lactam antibiotics showed that colistin, tigecycline, amikacin, and fosfomycin remain active against most of the isolates. multilocus sequence typing indicated that the most common sequence types (st) were st101 and st38 for k. pneumoniae and e. coli, respectively. the bla(oxa-48) gene was located on a 62 kb incl/m plasmid in 92.5% of the isolates,  indicating that a single plasmid was mainly responsible for the spread of that gene. in addition, this study identified multiple cases of importation of oxa-48  beta-lactamase producers at least in europe, and spread of oxa-48 beta-lactamase  producers giving rise to an endemic situation, at least in france.

TI  == intravenous colistin for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections in critically ill pediatric patients.
AB  == objectives: nosocomial infection due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens in icus is a challenge for clinicians and microbiologists and has led to the resurgence of iv colistin use in the last decade. the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of iv colistin in the treatment of critically ill children with multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections. design and setting: retrospective descriptive study conducted in the picu of maulana azad medical college and associated chacha nehru bal chikitsalaya, delhi, india, during the period of january 2010 to december 2011. patients: the records of critically ill  children with multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections treated with iv colistin were reviewed. results: fifty critically ill children received iv colistin; their median age was 36 months (range: 1 mo-12 yr), with male:female ratio of 3:2. the isolated pathogens were acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and enterobacter cloacae. mean duration of colistin therapy was 14.3 days (range, 7-21). a favorable clinical outcome occurred in 36 children (72%), and 14 children (28%) died due to severe sepsis with multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. renal toxicity occurred in five children and was associated with multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome in three and coadministration of vancomycin in two. no neurotoxic adverse effects due to colistin therapy were reported. conclusion: our study suggests that iv colistin may have a role in the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria in critically ill children, but further prospective and randomized control trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in children.

TI  == evaluation of brilliance cre agar for the detection of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of the new chromogenic medium brilliancetm creagar (thermo fisher scientific) for determining the limit  of detection of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria (cre). a total of 70 clinical isolates were studied. of these, 30 were well-characterized cre, including klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing kpc-, vim-, and oxa-type enzymes, vim-positive enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli, ndm-positive e. coli, and enterobacterial isolates characterized by porin loss associated with esbl production or ampc hyperproduction. ten carbapenem-resistant non-fermentative isolates were also included as well as 30 carbapenem-susceptible isolates. carbapenem-resistant strains were inoculated at three different concentrations onto brilliance cre agar (from 1.5x101 cfu/ml up to 1.5x104 cfu/ml) whereas carbapenem-susceptible isolates were inoculated at a concentration of 1.5x102 cfu/ml. the medium sustained the growth of carbapenem-resistant isolates, showing detection limits from 1.5x101 cfu/ml (in 31/40 cases) to 1.5x104 cfu/ml. no growth was observed with carbapenem-sensitive control strains. our results indicate that the brilliance cre agar allows the growth of carbapenem-resistant isolates with low detection limits and could represent a useful screening medium  for both enterobacteria and non-fermentative gram-negative strains resistant to carbapenems.

TI  == assessment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, kpc carbapenemase and porin resistance mechanisms in clinical samples of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter spp.
AB  == the emergence and spread of resistance mechanisms in gram-negative bacilli has complicated the treatment of serious nosocomial infections. current automated systems for detection of klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing isolates are unreliable. one possible straightforward alternative method is evaluation of ertapenem resistance. however, the accuracy of this method is affected by other resistance mechanisms such as ampc gene expression or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production associated with porin loss. this study included 128 samples of k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. that were non-susceptible to ertapenem. the disk diffusion and etest method were applied to determine susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem. isolates exhibiting intermediate or complete resistance to ertapenem were evaluated for resistance mechanisms. bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), bla(ctx-m-2) and bla(kpc)  genes were tested for by pcr, and the presence of outer membrane protein was investigated by dot-blot assay. bla(tem) was detected in 52.9% and 10.3%, bla(shv) in 29.4% and 0.94%, bla(ctx-m) in 41.4% and 1.9% and bla(ctx-m-2) in 23.5% and 1.9% of k. pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively.  the bla(kpc) gene was present in 12.6% of enterobacter spp. isolates. ompc and ompf were present in 6.6% of e. cloacae isolates. these results indicate that several resistance mechanisms contribute to potential therapeutic failure of carbapenem therapy and point to the need for better detection methods and surveillance strategies.

TI  == high prevalence of vim-4 and ndm-1 metallo-beta-lactamase among carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms leading to carbapenem resistance among multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with nosocomial infections in mubarak al kabeer hospital, kuwait. fourteen carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates were obtained from inpatients in different wards and intensive care units between april 2009 and february 2011. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using the e-test method. genes encoding beta-lactamases were characterized by specific pcr amplification, sequencing and conjugation assays. all isolates were identified as metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) producers using phenotypic and molecular methods. eleven of the 14 isolates produced vim-4 (six klebsiella pneumoniae, three escherichia coli, one enterobacter cloacae and one klebsiella oxytoca). three k.  pneumoniae isolates produced the mbl ndm-1 and co-produced the plasmid-encoded ampc cmy-4. the vim-4-producing isolates co-produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases including ctx-m-15 and some shv derivatives. the vim-4 gene was not transferable by conjugation studies of six selected strains. we demonstrated  here the emergence of vim-4- and ndm-1-producing isolates in the largest teaching hospital in kuwait.

TI  == [investigation of the presence of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) by pcr in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates].
AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == appropriateness of empirical treatment and outcome in bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  == we studied clinical characteristics, appropriateness of initial antibiotic treatment, and other factors associated with day 30 mortality in patients with bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria in eight dutch hospitals. retrospectively, information was collected from 232 consecutive patients with esbl bacteremia (due to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae) between 2008 and 2010. in this cohort (median age of 65 years; 24 patients were <18 years of age), many had comorbidities, such as malignancy (34%) or recurrent urinary tract infection (uti) (15%). one hundred forty episodes (60%) were nosocomial, 54 (23%) were otherwise health care associated, and 38 (16%) were community acquired. the most  frequent sources of infection were uti (42%) and intra-abdominal infection (28%). appropriate therapy within 24 h after bacteremia onset was prescribed to 37% of all patients and to 54% of known esbl carriers. the day 30 mortality rate was 20%. in a multivariable analysis, a charlson comorbidity index of >/= 3, an age of >/= 75 years, intensive care unit (icu) stay at bacteremia onset, a non-uti bacteremia source, and presentation with severe sepsis, but not inappropriate therapy within <24 h (adjusted odds ratio [or], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.68 to 3.45), were associated with day 30 mortality. further assessment of confounding and a stratified analysis for patients with uti and non-uti origins of infection did not reveal a statistically significant effect of inappropriate therapy on day 30 mortality, and these results were insensitive to the possible misclassification of patients who had received beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations or ceftazidime as initial treatment. in conclusion, esbl bacteremia occurs mostly in patients with comorbidities requiring frequent hospitalization, and 84% of episodes were health care associated. factors other than inappropriate therapy within <24 h determined day 30 mortality.

TI  == changes in fluoroquinolone resistance over 5 years (canward 2007-11) in bacterial pathogens isolated in canadian hospitals.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to analyse canadian national surveillance data, specifically fluoroquinolone resistance, from 2007 to 2011 inclusive, to determine trends in resistance over time and to assess correlations with patient demographic factors. methods: all isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae collected by the 10 sites that participated in the annual canward surveillance studies in each of the 5 years were included in this analysis. a multifactorial logistic regression model was used to determine the variables with significant impact on fluoroquinolone resistance. results: the proportion of e. coli isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin increased significantly (p = 0.0005) between 2007 (20.0%) and 2011  (29.2%), although similar increases were not seen in k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae (tested against levofloxacin) (p > 0.05). among isolates of s. aureus, there was a significant decrease in ciprofloxacin resistance from 34.4% in 2007 to 24.6% in 2011 (p < 0.0001). resistance to ciprofloxacin was a component of most multidrug-resistant (mdr) phenotypes for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. conclusions: a significant increase in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, primarily among urine isolates, and a significant decrease in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus occurred between 2007 and 2011. notably, mdr isolates were frequently fluoroquinolone resistant for all organisms studied, except s. pneumoniae.

TI  == distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the asia-pacific region: results of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == the increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections  (iai) from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the asia-pacific region were investigated. detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex pcr. a total of 699 enterobacteriaceae  isolates with positive genotypic results, included escherichia coli (n = 443), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), citrobacter freundii (n = 5), proteus mirabilis (n = 3), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of enterobacter asburiae, proteus vulgaris, and providencia rettgeri were analyzed.  nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated iai. ctx-m (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with ctx-m-15) was the most common esbl, followed by shv (n = 59) and tem (n = 4). cmy (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with cmy-2) was the most common ampc beta-lactamase, followed by dha (n = 46) and act/mir (n = 40). ndm (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with ndm-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by imp (n = 7) and oxa (n = 7). isolates from hospital-associated iai had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in enterobacteriaceae isolates from  india, except that imp beta-lactamases were also detected in philippines and australia. ctx-m beta-lactamases were the predominant esbls produced by enterobacteriaceae causing iai in the asia-pacific region. emergence of ctx-m-15-, cmy-2-, and ndm-1-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.

TI  == emergence and spread of ndm-1 producer enterobacteriaceae with contribution of incx3 plasmids in the united arab emirates.
AB  == among 28 clinically relevant, carbapenem non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates collected in 2009-2011 in the united arab emirates three klebsiella pneumoniae, two escherichia coli, one enterobacter cloacae and one citrobacter freundi were identified to produce ndm-1 carbapenemase. unexpectedly, with the exception of a k. pneumoniae strain, sequence type st11, originally acquired in india and subsequently spread nosocomially in the uae, the majority of the strains could not be directly linked to foreign travel. all isolates harboured the blandm-1 gene on plasmids of inca/c, inchi1b and incx3 types, or were untypable. incx3 type plasmids with a mass of 50 kb and with the same or highly similar restriction patterns, with regions flanking the blandm-1 gene identical to the incx3 ndm plasmids described from china were present in three different species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and c. freundii. our findings strongly support the assumptions that, beyond the indian subcontinent, the middle east is an important reservoir of ndm-producing organisms. furthermore, we also provide evidence that incx3 plasmids, recently implicated in the spread of blandm-1 in china, have been widely distributed and are important vehicles of the inter-species spread of the ndm-1 gene.

AB  == carbapenem resistance in enterobacteriaceae is increasing and has become a matter of great concern. the aim of this study was to characterize carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae from a teaching hospital. a total of 49 carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates recovered in 2007-2010 from the first affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical college were analyzed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. the carbapenemase phenotype, outer membrane protein profiles, and clonal relatedness were investigated using the modified hodge test, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). multilocus sequence typing (mlst) of klebsiella pneumoniae was also performed. beta-lactamase genes were examined by pcr and sequencing, and the transferability of carbapenemase genes was determined by a conjugation experiment. the rates of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem resistance were 59.2%, 40.8%, and 96.0%, respectively. thirty isolates exhibited carbapenemase activity, and 32 isolates carried carbapenemase genes. furthermore, 10 and 9 clinical isolates posessed ampc beta-lactamase and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genes, respectively. eight of 32 carbapenemase-producing isolates were proved to be carried by conjugative plasmids, and there was porin loss in 34.7% (17/49) of the isolates.  pfge analysis demonstrated that 9 kpc-2-producing serratia marcescens belonged to a clonal strain, suggesting the clonal dissemination of these kpc-2-bearing isolates among different wards. the mlst of k. pneumoniae revealed that two kpc-2 producers were st11. this study suggests that kpc-2-type carbapenemase is the main contributor to carbapenems resistance in carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae, and that esbl, ampc beta-lactamase overproduction, and porin  loss contribute to the resistance level among these isolates; in carbapenemase-non-producing enterobacteriaceae, esbl, ampc enzyme, and porin loss contribute to the carbapenems resistance of enterobacteriaceae, especially the ertapenem resistance of enterobacter cloacae.

TI  == carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicentre antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2009.
AB  == to investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by the clsi as well as 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by eucast. based on clsi 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively. all proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii isolates  were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of p. mirabilis and all m. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates. e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae with ertapenem mics>/=4 mg/l were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, respectively.  additionally, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=8 mg/l were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. these data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae as well as p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=4 mg/l.

AB  == objectives: clinical utility of carbapenem antibiotics is under threat because of the emergence of acquired metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) genes. we describe an outbreak in an intensive care unit (icu) possibly associated with contaminated sinks. design, setting and participants: four clusters of gram-negative bacteria  harbouring the mbl gene blaimp-4 were detected in the icu at dandenong hospital between november 2009 and july 2012. epidemiological investigations were undertaken in order to identify a common point source. during september 2012, screening using rectal swabs for all icu patients, and environmental swabs targeting all icu handwashing sinks and taps were collected. samples were cultured onto selective carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) agar. suspected cre isolates were further characterised using the modified hodge test and vitek 2 and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing of mbl genes. clinical and environmental cre isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. results: ten clinical isolates and one screening isolate of cre  (consisting of klebsiella pneumoniae [5], serratia marcescens [4], enterobacter cloacae [1] and escherichia coli [1]) were detected with the blaimp-4 gene over the 30-03 period. s. marcescens was isolated persistently from the grating and drain of eight central sinks. molecular typing confirmed that clinical and environmental isolates were related. tap water cultures were negative. several attempts to clean and decontaminate the sinks using detergents and steam cleaning proved unsuccessful. conclusion: this report highlights the importance of identification of potential environmental reservoirs, such as sinks, for control  of outbreaks of environmentally hardy multiresistant organisms.

TI  == characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing  enterobacteriaceae isolates from rivers and lakes in switzerland.
AB  == one of the currently most relevant resistance mechanisms in enterobacteriaceae is the production of enzymes that lead to modern expanded-spectrum cephalosporin and even carbapenem resistance, mainly extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and  carbapenemases. a worrisome aspect is the spread of esbl and carbapenemase producers into the environment. the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of esbl- and carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae and to further characterize esbl- and carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in rivers and lakes in switzerland. esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae were detected in 21 (36.2%) of the 58 bodies of water sampled. one river sample tested positive for a carbapenemase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strain. seventy-four individual strains expressing an esbl phenotype were isolated. species identification revealed 60 escherichia coli strains, seven klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains, five raoultella planticola strains, one enterobacter cloacae strain, and one enterobacter amnigenus strain. three strains were identified as shv-12 esbl producers, and 71 strains carried genes encoding ctx-m esbls. of the 71 strains with ctx-m esbl genes, 8 isolates expressed ctx-m-1, three produced ctx-m-3, 46 produced ctx-m-15, three produced ctx-m-55, one produced ctx-m-79, six produced ctx-m-14, and four produced ctx-m-27. three of the four ctx-m-27 producers belonged to the multiresistant pandemic sequence type e. coli b2:st131 that is strongly associated with potentially severe infections in humans and animals.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus- the predominant pathogen in the neonatal icu of a tertiary care hospital in amritsar, india.
AB  == background: an early treatment and the appropriate and the rational use of antibiotics would minimize the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in neonatal sepsis, and reduce the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms in intensive care units. for the success of an early empiric treatment, a periodic review of the cases to assess any changing trends in the infecting organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility is important. aim: to study the most commonly encountered bacterial pathogens which caused neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity patterns, so that guidelines could be prepared for a rational antibiotic therapy. setting and design: this was a retrospective study which was  conducted in the department of microbiology and the neonatal intensive care unit  (nicu) at sgrdimsar, amritsar, during june 2011 to june 2012. methods and materials: blood specimens for culture were drawn from 311 newborns who were admitted in an nicu with sepsis. the specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. the isolates were identified by doing standard biochemical tests. the antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolates were studied by the kirby bauer disc diffusion technique. results: a total of 131 organisms were isolated from the 311 blood cultures. these included staphylococcus aureus (n=68), coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) (n=30), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=10), acinetobacter baumannii (n=9), escherichia coli (n=05), enterobacter cloacae (n=04), citrobacter diversus (n=02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=02) and candida (n=01). staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen in both early and late-onset sepsis.  on antibiotic sensitivity testing, 57.35% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. more than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to amikacin. the resistance to the third generation cephalosporins varied between 50-55%. the resistance to ciprofloxacin was quite high; however, most of the isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. a majority of the isolates were susceptible to piperacillin- tazobactum and imipenem. conclusion: the present study emphasized the importance of periodic surveys on the microbial flora which was encountered in particular neonatal settings to recognize the trend.

TI  == enterobacteriaceae infections of very low birth weight infants in polish neonatal intensive care units: resistance and cross-transmission.
AB  == background: the aims of our study were analysis of the occurrence of infections by members of the enterobacteriaceae family in 6 polish neonatal intensive care units in 2009, their drug resistance, the epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains and the possibility of using modern tools of microbiology diagnosis in infection control, especially for the reduction of antimicrobial resistance. methods: a prospective surveillance covered 910 newborns. case patients were defined as neonates with very low birth weight who had clinical signs of septicemia, pneumonia or necrotizing enterocolitis. early-onset infection was defined as infection diagnosed within 3 days after delivery. results: the incidence of enterobacteriaceae infections was 2.6/1000 patient-days. the risk of enterobacteriaceae pneumonia increased with the length  of hospitalization (p = 0.0356). the most common pathogen was escherichia coli (12.4% of all strains, in early-onset infection 18.5%) and klebsiella spp. (9.1%  of all). the esbl phenotype was found in 37% of isolates, of which 89.3% were producing ctx-m-type, 70.2% tem-type and 8.5% shv-type. epidemic clones were detected in the 2 studied neonatal intensive care units: 6 of the 9 esbl-positive enterobacter cloacae and 16 of the 18 esbl-positive klebsiella pneumoniae strains were classified into 1 epidemic clone, which showed resistance to penicillin without inhibitors, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, cephalosporins, aztreoname, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. conclusions: enterobacteriaceae bacilli are a significant problem in neonatal intensive care units, especially in early-onset infection and for long hospitalized very low birth weight infants. the observed high drug resistance was in large part related to the dominance of epidemic strains as a result of horizontal transmission. the  best way to reduce drug resistance would be adequate procedures of isolation and  hand hygiene.

TI  == susceptibility patterns to extended-spectrum cephalosporins among enterobacteriaceae harbouring extended-spectrum beta-lactamases using the updated clinical and laboratory standards institute interpretive criteria.
AB  == we examined the effect of applying the updated 2010 clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) susceptibility breakpoints for extended-spectrum cephalosporins (escs) to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae. in total, 202 esbl-producing, plasmidic ampc- and carbapenemase-negative isolates derived from separate patients were collected from three greek hospitals during 2007-2011, including 150 escherichia coli, 43 klebsiella pneumoniae and 9 enterobacter cloacae clinical isolates. esbls were detected using the esbl clsi confirmatory test and pcr assays. sequencing analysis showed that 91 (45.0%) of the esbl-producers carried the bla(ctx-m-3) gene, 66 (32.7%) carried the bla(ctx-m-15) gene and the remaining 45 (22.3%) carried the bla(shv-5) gene. minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime were determined by the agar dilution method. based on the new clsi breakpoints, 13 (6.4%) of the esbl-producers were susceptible to cefotaxime, 90 (44.6%) to ceftazidime and 112 (55.4%) to cefepime; as many as 145 (71.8%) were susceptible to at least one esc. among the 150 e. coli, 12 (8.0%), 87 (58.0%) and 79 (52.7%) were susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime, respectively, whilst among the 43 k. pneumoniae, 1 (2.3%), 3 (7.0%) and 25 (58.1%) were susceptible to the above escs, respectively. none of the nine e.  cloacae were susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but all except one were susceptible to cefepime. by implementation of the new 2010 clsi breakpoints, a considerable proportion of esbl-possessing enterobacteriaceae would be reported as susceptible, mostly to ceftazidime and cefepime, leading to possible infection control and therapeutic implications.

TI  == microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in central alabama.
AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. they are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. the purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in central alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. this was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their  antibiotic resistance profile at this central alabama hospital. the survey period was between july 2009 and june 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed  and susceptibility testing was determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method. the results indicated that escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.8%), enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3.0%),  klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter freundii (1.5%), morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). for the 215 e. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, p < 0.05). in contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, p < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this central alabama hospital. additionally, this study found that e. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (lee et al. 2010; rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. it is imperative to monitor the resistance of p. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.

TI  == molecular and epidemiological characterization of enterobacterial multidrug-resistant strains in tlemcen hospital (algeria) (2008-2010).
AB  == seventy-one isolates of enterobacteriaceae (17 escherichia coli, 50 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 4 enterobacter cloacae) producing extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (esbls) were collected between april 2008 and march 2010 in an intensive care unit and surgical ward of tlemcen hospital (west  of algeria). sequencing identified the bla(ctx-m-15) determinant in 69 isolates and bla(ctx-m-3) in 2 isolates. none of the studied strains produced the class d  carbapenemase oxa-48. repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction showed a high degree of genotypic diversity among e. coli strains and two major clonal populations of k. pneumoniae (ckp1 n=11 and ckp5 n=25) which were further  identified as members of the multilocus sequence typing types (st931) and (st15), respectively. the st15 isolates harbored more resistance genes and virulence factors than the st931 isolates. the characterization of the spacer region between isecp1 and bla(ctx-m) for ctx-m-15 producers individualized two populations. one that derived from the ctx-m-3 under algerian clinical context and one that is universally found. the dissemination of esbls in the studied enterobacteriaceae isolates was mainly due to the epidemic clones of k. pneumoniae and to genetic transit of plasmids among unrelated strains.

TI  == identification of protoxins and a microbial basis for red maple (acer rubrum) toxicosis in equines.
AB  == the leaves of acer rubrum (red maple), especially when wilted in the fall, cause  severe oxidative damage to equine erythrocytes, leading to potentially fatal methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia. gallic acid and tannins from a. rubrum leaves have been implicated as the toxic compounds responsible for red maple toxicosis, but the mechanism of action and toxic principle(s) have not been elucidated to date. in order to investigate further how red maple toxicosis occurs, aqueous solutions of gallic acid, tannic acid, and ground dried a. rubrum leaves were incubated with contents of equine ileum, jejunum, cecum, colon, and liver, and then analyzed for the metabolite pyrogallol, as pyrogallol is a more potent oxidizing agent. gallic acid was observed to be metabolized to pyrogallol  maximally in equine ileum contents in the first 24 hr. incubation of tannic acid  and a. rubrum leaves, individually with ileum contents, produced gallic acid and, subsequently, pyrogallol. ileum suspensions, when passed through a filter to exclude microbes but not enzymes, formed no pyrogallol, suggesting a microbial basis to the pathway. bacteria isolated from ileum capable of pyrogallol formation were identified as klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. therefore, gallotannins and free gallic acid are present in a. rubrum leaves and  can be metabolized by k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae found in the equine ileum to form pyrogallol either directly or through a gallic acid intermediate (gallotannins). identification of these compounds and their physiological effects is necessary for the development of effective treatments for red maple toxicosis  in equines.

TI  == [common pathogens and clinical characteristics of neonatal pneumonia].
AB  == objective: to study common pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility as well  as clinical characteristics of neonatal pneumonia. methods: a retrospective study on neonatal pneumonia was performed. the study investigated antibiotic susceptibility of four common pathogens (339 strains) that caused neonatal pneumonia. clinical characteristics of the newborns with pneumonia were analyzed. of the 339 strains, 185 were isolated from bronchial secretions, 72 from blood samples, and 82 with positive results of both samples. results: four hundred and  seventy-four neonates with pneumonia presented positive results of bacterial culture. the most common pathogens staphylococcus aureus (21.9%), escherichia coli (19.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (19.0%) and enterobacter cloacae (11.4%). the birth weight of newborns infected with staphylococcus aureus was generally normal, and the time of hospital admission was later (after 24 hours of life). in contrast, the newborns with gram-negative bacterial infection, especially klebsiella pneumoniae infection, had lower birth weights and early time of hospital admission (within 24 hours of life). nearly more than 50% gram-negative  bacteria were resistant to second, third and forth generation cephaloporins. conclusions: gram-negative bacteria are predominant pathogens of neonatal pneumonia. neonatal pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria is common in newborns with low birth weight and its onset time is relatively earlier. gram-negative bacteria that cause neonatal pneumonia are highly resistant to cephaloporins.

AB  == the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm-1) is one of the most important resistance traits in enterobacteriaceae. we characterized nine bla ndm-1 producing enterobacteriaceae recovered from seven patients who have recently travelled or been treated in india (n=1) or mainland china (n=6) during december  2010-may 2012. all the china-linked patients had no links to the indian subcontinent. the bla ndm-1 carrying plasmids belonged to the novel incx3 ( approximately 50 kb, in seven isolates including two escherichia coli, two klebsiella pneumoniae, one citrobacter freundii, one enterobacter aerogenes and one e. cloacae), inca/c2 ( approximately 140 kb, in one e. coli) or fii-f1b groups ( approximately 110 kb, in one e. coli). restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the seven incx3 plasmids revealed identical pattern in six and two bands difference in the remaining one. the incx3 plasmids carrying bla ndm-1 were epidemiologically linked to guangzhou (n=1), hunan (n=4), haifeng  (n=1) and dongguan (n=1) in mainland china. complete sequencing of the incx3 plasmid pndm-hn380 revealed that it was 54 035 bp long and encoded 52 open reading frames. the bla ndm-1 gene was found in a transposon-like structure flanked by isaba125 and is26, inserted into the plasmid genetic load region. the  sequences of the bla ndm-1 containing module within the two is elements were identical to those previously described for bla ndm-1-positive tn125 in the plasmids or chromosome of acinetobacter isolates. in summary, this is the first description of incx3 plasmids carrying bla ndm-1. the findings indicate the worrisome involvement of an epidemic plasmid in the dissemination of ndm-1 in china.

TI  == discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  == abstract. a method, based on raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed.  spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (gram-negative: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, and gram-positive: staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a raman spectrometer with a fiber raman probe (830 nm). colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for raman measurements. after preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and mahalanobis distance (pca/md) discrimination algorithm. we found that the mean raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and s. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. pca/md could discriminate gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.

TI  == dissemination of incfii(k)-type plasmids in multiresistant ctx-m-15-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates from children in hospital paediatric oncology wards.
AB  == in this study, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates in children with malignancies hospitalised at a paediatric oncology department in the czech republic were investigated. from june 2009 to january 2010, a total of 50 esbl-producing faecal isolates of enterobacteriaceae were obtained from 28 patients. these isolates were characterised with regard to esbl enzymes, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance  genes, multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and plasmids conferring resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. esbl-producing isolates included klebsiella  pneumoniae (n=36), escherichia coli (n=7), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=2) and citrobacter freundii (n=2). klebsiella pneumoniae isolates belonged to 7 mlst types, including sequence types st280, st321, st323 and st416  as well as the novel types st626, st627 and st628. the multiresistant epidemic clone e. coli b2-o25b-st131 was detected in one patient. the gene bla(ctx-m-15) was found on large conjugative incfii(k) plasmids along with bla(tem-1), bla(oxa-1), qnrb1, aac(6')-ib-cr, stra, sul2, aac(3')-ii and tet(a) genes in most isolates. dissemination of incfii(k) plasmids among various enterobacteriaceae isolates was considered an important aspect of nosocomial colonisation in the wards by enterobacteriaceae species producing esbls. this is the first study documenting multiple antibiotic resistance elements, including qnr genes, in incfii(k) plasmids in various bacterial species isolated in a single hospital department. the results highlight the evolution of incfii(k) plasmids into new variants containing novel antibiotic resistance elements and their important role in spreading esbl-producing bacteria among hospitalised patients.

TI  == catheter-related complications in cancer patients on home parenteral nutrition: a prospective study of over 51,000 catheter days.
AB  == background: although home parenteral nutrition (hpn) is often indicated in cancer patients, many physicians are concerned about the risks potentially associated with the use of central venous access devices (vads) in these patients. the aim of this prospective study was to investigate the actual incidence of vad-related  complications in cancer patients on hpn. methods: all adult cancer patient candidates for vad insertion and hpn were enrolled. the incidence of complications associated with 4 types of vads (peripherally inserted central catheter [picc], hohn catheter, tunneled groshong catheter, and port) was investigated, as well as the most significant risk factors. results: two hundred  eighty-nine vads in 254 patients were studied, for a total of 51,308 catheter-days. the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsis)  was low (0.35/1000 catheter-days), particularly for piccs (0/1000; p < .01 vs hohn and tunneled catheters) and for ports (0.19/1000; p < .01 vs hohn and p < .05 vs tunneled catheters). mechanical complications were uncommon (0.8/1000), as was vad-related venous thrombosis (0.06/1000). ultrasound-guided venipuncture was associated with a decreased risk of crbsi (p < .04) and thrombosis (p < .001). vad securement using sutureless devices reduced the risk of crbsi and dislocation (p < .001). hohn catheters had no advantage over piccs (higher complication rate  and shorter dwell time; p < .001). conclusions: in cancer patients, hpn can be safely carried out with a low incidence of complications. also, vads are not equal in terms of complication rates, and strict adherence to meticulous insertion policies may effectively reduce catheter-related complications.

TI  == bloodstream infections caused by imp-8-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates: the need for clinical laboratory detection of metallo-beta-lactamases?
AB  == a retrospective study was conducted at a taiwanese medical center to characterize bloodstream infections caused by imp-8 metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates and to assess the need for laboratory detection of imp producers. we analyzed 37 patients infected with imp-8 producers (two escherichia coli, nine klebsiella pneumoniae, 25 enterobacter cloacae, and one citrobacter freundii) and 107 patients infected with non-imp-8 producers (eight e. coli, 26 k. pneumoniae, 70 e. cloacae, and three c. freundii) that were interpreted as carbapenem-nonsusceptible based on the updated clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) 2010 guidelines. only 18 (48.6 %) of the imp-8 producers were regarded as potential carbapenemase producers based on the clsi 2012 guidelines. the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) was more common in the mbl group (73.0 %) than in the non-mbl group (41.1 %). there were no significant differences in carbapenem susceptibilities, clinical characteristics, carbapenem use for empirical and definitive treatment, and mortality rates between the two groups. eighteen imp-8 producers could be deemed  as resistant to all carbapenems [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of any carbapenem >/=2 mug/ml]; patients with these isolates had a lower, but non-significant, 28-day mortality rate (27.8 %) than patients infected with non-mbl producers having similar carbapenem mics (39.0 %) (p = 0.41). a multivariate analysis revealed severity of acute illness as the single independent variable associated with both 7-day and 28-day mortality rates (p < 0.01) for infections caused by enterobacteriaceae with decreased carbapenem susceptibilities. our findings suggest that the clinical detection of imp-producing enterobacteriaceae is not required even when the "old" clsi criteria are used.

TI  == characterization of fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance mechanisms in enterobacteriaceae isolated in a dutch teaching hospital reveals the presence of  an escherichia coli st131 clone with a specific mutation in pare.
AB  == objectives: to characterize the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance in enterobacteriaceae from a dutch teaching hospital in 2008. methods: we sequenced gyra, gyrb, parc and pare. the presence of plasmid-encoded genes qnra, qnrb, qnrs, aac(6')-ib, qepa, bla(tem), bla(shv,) bla(oxa), bla(ctx-m) and  bla(ampc) was studied by pcr. escherichia coli isolates were further characterized by aflp and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). results: in total, 49 e. coli, 16 klebsiella pneumoniae and 3 enterobacter cloacae isolates were investigated. mutations in gyra were found in all e. coli isolates. forty-five (92%) e. coli isolates carried at least one point mutation in parc. most e. coli  isolates (59%) also carried mutations in pare, of which i529l was the most prevalent. i529l was unequivocally associated with e. coli sequence type (st) 131. this single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) was later also found in eight out  of nine st131 strains from another collection. twenty-nine e. coli isolates carried extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genes, predominantly bla(ctx-m-15). in e. coli, aac(6')-ib-cr was the predominant plasmid-mediated resistance mechanism, whereas in k. pneumoniae qnr genes were found mostly. in k. pneumoniae isolates, qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr co-occurred with esbl genes (n = 13; bla(ctx-m) and bla(shv)) and/or bla(ampc) (n = 3; bla(dha-1)). conclusions: e. coli st131 was the predominant clone, which accumulated a high number of chromosomal mutations. the i529l snp in pare was a signature of most, but not all, st131 strains. in contrast to e. coli, fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms were predominantly plasmid-encoded in k. pneumoniae.

TI  == real-time pcr for detection of blaoxa-48 genes from stools.
AB  == objectives: outbreaks of oxa-48-like carbapenemase producers are increasingly reported in many european countries and are often the result of difficulties in detection, especially for isolates with mics of carbapenems that remain in the susceptibility range. methods: an in-house real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) assay using taqman chemistry to detect bla(oxa-48-like) genes was compared with bacterial culturing on chromid esbl and supercarba media of spiked stool samples  with several species producing oxa-48 variants. results: qpcr amplification using plasmid dna was linear over 10 log dilutions (r(2) = 0.998 and slope = -3.14), with an amplification efficiency of 1.10, and the detection limit of the assay was reproducibly estimated at 10 plasmid molecules/pcr. no cross-reaction was detected with dna extracted from several multidrug-resistant bacteria harbouring  other beta-lactam resistance genes. the bla(oxa-48) qpcr assay was capable of detecting 10-50 cfu of oxa-48 producers/100 mg of faeces. chromid esbl was capable of detecting oxa-48 producers (1 x 10(1) to 3 x 10(2) cfu/100 mg of faeces), as long as the isolates exhibited a high level of resistance to cephalosporins due to an associated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. the supercarba screening medium was capable of detecting all the oxa-48-like producers (1-3 x 10(1) cfu/100 mg of faeces), except those producing oxa-163, a variant lacking carbapenem-hydrolysing activity. conclusions: the qpcr is likely  to shorten the time for bla(oxa-48) detection from 48 to 4 h and will be a valuable tool for outbreak follow-up in order to rapidly isolate colonized patients and assign them to cohorts.

TI  == emergence of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae as causes of bloodstream infections in patients with hematologic malignancies.
AB  == carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) are increasingly prevalent pathogens. however, little is known about their emergence in patients with hematologic malignancies. we identified 18 patients with hematologic malignancies over 3.5 years who developed bloodstream infections (bsis) caused by cre. fourteen bsis were caused by klebsiella pneumoniae, three by enterobacter cloacae, and one was polymicrobial. initial empirical antimicrobial therapy was active in two patients (11%), and a median of 55 h elapsed between culture collection and receipt of an active agent. ten patients (56%) died, including nine (69%) of 13 neutropenic patients, with a median of 4 days from culture collection until death. cre isolates were analyzed for carbapenemase production,  beta-lactamase genes and outer membrane porin deletions and characterized by multilocus sequence typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). carbapenem resistance mechanisms included klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase production and ctx-m-15 production with an absent outer membrane porin protein. no isolate had >/=95% homology on pfge, indicating a heterogeneous, non-outbreak  population of isolates. cre bsis are emerging in patients with hematologic malignancies and are associated with ineffective initial empirical therapy, long  delays in administration of active antimicrobials and high mortality rates. new diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive strategies for cre infections in this vulnerable population are needed.

TI  == detection of amp c genes encoding for beta-lactamases in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == purpose: amp c beta-lactamase are ambler class c enzymes that confer resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins and are not inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors. their detection is crucial, since the phenotypic tests are not standardised leading to ambiguity in interpretation of results. this study was done to detect the types of amp c prevalent in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: seventy-seven consecutive cefoxitin resistant clinical isolates of e. coli (n = 25) and k. pneumoniae (n = 52) were included in the study. antibiotic susceptibility testing to various classes of antibiotics was performed by disc diffusion using clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) to cefoxitin, imipenem and meropenem were  determined by broth microdilution method. isolates were screened for production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). multiplex pcr was performed for the detection of amp c genes after phenotypic testing (hodge test and inhibitor based test). results: cefoxitin hodge test was positive in 40 isolates which included 20 e. coli and 20 k. pneumoniae. there was zone enhancement with boronic acid in  55 isolates, of which 36 were k. pneumoniae and 19 were e. coli. multiplex pcr detected amp c in 11/25 e. coli and 12/52 k. pneumoniae isolates. the amp c genes detected were cit (amp c origin - citrobacter freundii), dha (dhahran hospital, saudi arabia), acc (ambler class c), ebc (amp c origin - enterobacter cloacae) groups. esbl was co-produced in 54 isolates. conclusions: amp c was detected in 29.87% of the study isolates. majority of them co-produced esbl. the most common  amp c was the cit family. screen tests for cefoxitin resistance may be falsely positive due to production of carbapenamases.

TI  == is there a direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a?
AB  == study type--therapy (case series) level of evidence 4. what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? several studies describe a reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after intradetrusor injections of botulinum neurotoxin a (bont/a). it was, however, unclear if a direct antibacterial effect of bont/a plays a role  in this clinical observation. this is the first study to investigate a potential  antibacterial effect of two frequently used bont/a formulations (i.e. botox(r) and dysport(r)), providing evidence that bont/a does not exert an antibacterial effect on lower urinary tract pathogens. objective: * to determine a potential direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a). materials and methods: * a prospective study was carried out using onabotulinumtoxin a (botox(r)) and abobotulinumtoxin a (dypsort(r)) in agar diffusion and broth microdilution assays with various clinical urinary tract isolates (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and bacillus subtilis). * inhibition zones (mm) of bacteria around a disc containing 20 microl saline with 4 iu of botox(r) were measured in the agar diffusion assay. * minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics, iu/ml) of both toxins for all bacteria were determined in the broth microdilution assay after overnight incubation at 35 degrees c. results: * there was no inhibition zone in the agar diffusion assays with any bacterial strain. * the microdilution test using botox(r) and dysport(r) showed bacterial growth in all dilutions, i.e. mics > 20 and >100 iu/ml for botox(r) and dysport(r), respectively. conclusions: * bont/a has no direct antimicrobial effect. * the reduced frequency of symptomatic urinary tract infections (sutis) in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (ndo) after  bont/a intradetrusor injections seems to be caused by different indirect mechanisms, which are still not completely understood.

TI  == carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in finland: the first years (2008-11).
AB  == objectives: carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) are becoming a global problem; they are often resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. here we report details on all finnish cpe isolates found until the end of 2011: carbapenemase genes, travel history and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) data. methods: enterobacteriaceae sent to the antimicrobial resistance unit of the national institute for health and welfare were tested for susceptibility to carbapenems, screened for carbapenemases by pcr and isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems were tested for hydrolysis of imipenem. carbapenemase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were  typed by mlst. results: in all, 26 cpe strains were found from 25 patients: 10 with oxa-48-like enzymes, 5 with kpc, 4 with vim, 3 with ndm, 3 with imi/nmc-a and 1 with ges-14. the species were k. pneumoniae (n = 16), e. coli (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 3) and raoultella planticola (n = 1). of the 25 patients, 18 had a known travel history/hospital transfer from abroad. local spread/transmission was suspected in 2011, but there were no hospital outbreaks.  the k. pneumoniae multilocus sequence types st258, st182, st147, st244, st14, st13, st383, st101 and st15, and the e. coli sequence types st38 and st90 were found. many of these are global epidemic clones. conclusions: cpe strains are increasingly found in finland, but still at a very low prevalence.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == seasonality in gram-negative and healthcare-associated infections.
AB  == to assess seasonal variations in gram-negative and healthcare-associated infections (hcais), a literature search was performed with combinations of the keywords 'seasonality', 'seasonal variations', 'gram-negative bacilli', 'infections', 'nosocomial infections', and 'health care associated infections', to retrieve articles published in english in peer-reviewed journals from 1 january 1970 to 29 february 2012. seasonality was demonstrated for infections, mostly bloodstream infections (bsis), caused by acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, with higher rates of infection during the summer months in north america, europe, the  middle east, australia, and asia. correlations were observed between temperature  increase and rates of bsi for acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae. a significant correlation between lower urinary tract infections and higher temperature and decreased relative humidity could explain the seasonality of some bsis. regarding hcai, seasonality is intrinsically present in most viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, because viruses are introduced into hospitals during seasonal community outbreaks. other  hcais subject to seasonal variations include surgical wound infections, with winter peaks in the usa and summer peaks in finland, central-line-associated bsis in haematology/oncology paediatric outpatients, and dialysis-associated peritonitis. in summary, seasonal variations have been shown for infections caused by many gram-negative bacilli, as well as for a few hcais, but many studies remain to be performed in order to better understand the mechanisms of these variations.

TI  == the variability of bacterial aerosol in poultry houses depending on selected factors.
AB  == objectives: this study is aimed at evaluation of bacterial air contamination in intensive poultry breeding. the evaluation was based on the determined levels of  bacterial concentrations and qualitative identification of isolated microorganisms. materials and methods: the study covered 5 poultry houses: two hatcheries and three hen houses with the litter bed system. the air was sampled in three measurement series in the central part of the investigated workplace at  the height of about 1.5 m over the ground, using portable measuring sets consisting of a gilair 5 (sensidyne, usa) pump and a measuring head filled with a glass microfibre filter (whatman, uk). for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of microorganisms were used appropriate microbiological media. results:  the total concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria inside the poultry breeding houses ranged from 4.74 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.89 x 10(8) cfu/m(3). for gram-negative bacteria, the range comprised the values from 4.33 x 10(2) cfu/m(3) to 4.29 x 10(6) cfu/m(3). the concentrations of the cocci of enterococcus genus ranged from 1.53 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.09 x 10(7) cfu/m(3), whereas those of other gram-positive bacteria from 3.78 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 6.65 x 10(7) cfu/m(3). the lowest concentrations of each group of the examined microorganisms were noted in the second measurement series when the air exchange in the breeding houses was over twice higher than in first and third measurement series because the mechanical ventilation was supported by natural ventilation (opened gates in the  buildings). the lowest concentrations of total bacteria were obtained in those buildings where one-day old chickens were kept. gram-positive bacteria of the genera: staphylococcus, enterococcus, corynebacterium, brevibacterium, micrococcus, cellulomonas, bacillus, aerococcus, and gram-negative bacteria of the genera: pseudomonas, moraxella, escherichia, enterobacter, klebsiella, pasteurella, pantoea were isolated. it was shown that for most of the investigated livestock premises the total bacteria concentrations exceeded the reference value of 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/m(3). furthermore, pathogenic microorganisms which are a potential threat to human health (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium) were found among the identified bacteria. conclusions: the results indicate that the hygienic conditions of the working environment connected with litter bed system production of poultry are affected by changes of the efficiency of ventilation and create a direct health risk to employees. they should use personal protective measures to protect their respiratory tract, especially when  the gates in the hen houses are closed.

TI  == presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in waste waters, kinshasa, the democratic republic of the congo.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae are a major  public health concern. we previously demonstrated the presence of esbl-producing  enterobacteriaceae in sachet-packaged water bags sold in kinshasa, the democratic republic of the congo. in complement to the previous study, we aimed to assess the presence of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in waste waters in kinshasa.enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from environmental water samples were screened and phenotypically confirmed as esbl-producers by disk diffusion according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines (clsi  m100-s21). final identification to the species level and further antimicrobial susceptibility testing were carried out with microscan(r) nbc42 panels and the identification of bla (esbl) coding genes was performed by a commercial multiplex ligation polymerase chain reaction (pcr) microarray (check-points ct 101, wageningen, the netherlands). overall, 194 non-duplicate enterobacteriaceae were  recovered from several sewer and river sites in nine out of 24 municipalities of  kinshasa. fourteen isolates (7.4 %) were confirmed as esbl-producers, the main species being enterobacter cloacae (46.6 %) and klebsiella pneumoniae (40.0 %). associated resistance to both aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone antibiotics was  observed in ten isolates; the remaining isolates showed co-resistance to either fluoroquinolone (n = 3) or to aminoglycoside (n = 1) alone. all but one isolate carried bla (ctx-m) genes belonging to the ctx-m-1 group. esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae are increasingly being reported from various sources in the community. the present results suggest that esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae are widespread in the environment in the community of kinshasa. cities in central africa should be added to the map of potentially esbl-contaminated environments and highlight the need to reinforce safe water supply and public sanitation.

TI  == spread of an ompk36-modified st15 klebsiella pneumoniae variant during an outbreak involving multiple carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae species and clones.
AB  == we aim to characterise multiple ertapenem-resistant (ert-r, n = 15) enterobacteriaceae isolates identified as presumptive carbapenemase producers in  a portuguese hospital in a short period of time (march-july 2010). antibiotic susceptibility patterns, beta-lactamases, genetic relatedness [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multi-locus sequence typing (mlst)], plasmid content and  major enterobacterial porins were investigated. ertapenem resistance was associated with deficiencies in major porins and, in some cases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc beta-lactamase production among outbreak and non-outbreak clones. most isolates (n = 8) corresponded to two ert-r klebsiella pneumoniae st15 pfge-types: (i) a sporadic variant (kp-a-ert, n = 1) presenting a premature stop codon in ompk36 and (ii) an epidemic variant (kp-b-ert, n = 7) exhibiting a new ompk36 porin variant, which differed additionally in plasmid and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. st14 (n = 1) and  st45 (n = 1) k. pneumoniae, st131 (n = 1) and st354 (n = 1) escherichia coli, enterobacter asburiae (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1) ert-r clones were also sporadically detected. porin changes in  these isolates included non-sense mutations [ompk35, ompk36, ompf; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 4-32 mg/l], is-mediated porin disruptions (ompk36, ompc; mic = 12->32 mg/l) or alterations in the l3 loop (ompk36; mic = 4-16 mg/l). we describe, for the first time in portugal, the simultaneous emergence of multiple ert-r enterobacteriaceae species and clones in a short period of time. moreover, our results support that a ctx-m-15-producing st15 k. pneumoniae with an ompk36-modified porin might successfully spread in the nosocomial setting.

TI  == the "other" gram-negative bacteria in mastitis: klebsiella, serratia, and more.
AB  == mastitis caused by gram-negative infections is of increasing importance on modern and well-managed dairy farms. without a doubt, e coli tends to be the most important cause of these gram-negative infections when the data are tallied across farms.1 however, more precise investigation of individual farms often reveals a farm-specific infection pattern where a single gram-negative bacterial  species predominates. several farms with a predominance of "other" gram-negative  imis may be observed. we have shown the presence of outbreaks on individual dairy farms with k pneumoniae, s marcescens, and enterobacter cloacae. on farms with a  predominance of these "other" gram-negative infections, a detailed epidemiologic  investigation may reveal the source of these infections. it is quite surprising to identify the difference in host immune response pattern and the associated clinical and subclinical presentations of imis due to the different gram-negative organisms. experimental and field observations would suggest that among the gram-negative bacterial causes of mastitis, klebsiella spp are causing the most severe cases, closely followed by e coli and then much less clinical severity is  observed in serratia spp and enterobacter spp cases. the precise mechanisms that  would explain the difference in clinical severity are not known, but the most likely explanation appears to be the structure of the lipid a fraction of the lps of the bacterial species. important differences in the lipid a fraction of lps between and within bacterial species are observed. the prevention of imis with gram-negative bacteria has components that are generic across species and components that are species specific. generic prevention may be obtained by improving hygiene and reducing exposure of teat ends to environmental contamination. also the use of a j5 bacterin is expected to provide some reduction in severity of gram-negative imis across bacterial species. specific prevention programs will depend on the actual transmission behavior of the dominant species causing imis in the herd. several clonal outbreaks of gram-negative bacterial species have been described. in such situations, optimal  milking procedures, segregation and culling of infected animals, and targeted treatment would be advisable. even more specific are the prevention procedures associated with s marcescens outbreaks, where resistance against specific biocides will lead to transmission of infection through teat disinfectants. removal of these biocides from the cow environment is than essential. antimicrobial treatment of gram-negative bacteria has often considered to be of limited value and treatment should be more targeted toward cow survival and reduction of clinical symptoms. more recently, extended treatment with a third-generation cephalosporin was reported to be efficacious in the treatment of e coli and klebsiella spp but not of e cloacae. further investigations in effective treatment protocols for gram-negative imis are warranted.

TI  == characterization of rara, a novel arac family multidrug resistance regulator in klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == transcriptional regulators, such as soxs, rama, mara, and rob, which upregulate the acrab efflux pump, have been shown to be associated with multidrug resistance in clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria. in addition to the multidrug resistance phenotype, these regulators have also been shown to play a role in the cellular metabolism and possibly the virulence potential of microbial cells. as such, the increased expression of these proteins is likely to cause pleiotropic phenotypes. klebsiella pneumoniae is a major nosocomial pathogen which can express the soxs, mara, rob, and rama proteins, and the accompanying paper shows  that the increased transcription of rama is associated with tigecycline resistance (m. veleba and t. schneiders, antimicrob. agents chemother. 56:4466-4467, 2012). bioinformatic analyses of the available klebsiella genome sequences show that an additional arac-type regulator is encoded chromosomally. in this work, we characterize this novel arac-type regulator, hereby called rara  (regulator of antibiotic resistance a), which is encoded in k. pneumoniae, enterobacter sp. 638, serratia proteamaculans 568, and enterobacter cloacae. we show that the overexpression of rara results in a multidrug resistance phenotype  which requires a functional acrab efflux pump but is independent of the other arac regulators. quantitative real-time pcr experiments show that rara (mgh 78578 kpn_02968) and its neighboring efflux pump operon oqxab (kpn_02969_02970) are consistently upregulated in clinical isolates collected from various geographical locations (chile, turkey, and germany). our results suggest that rara overexpression upregulates the oqxab efflux pump. additionally, it appears that oqxr, encoding a gntr-type regulator adjacent to the oqxab operon, is able to downregulate the expression of the oqxab efflux pump, where oqxr complementation  resulted in reductions to olaquindox mics.

TI  == characterization of enterobacteriaceae producing oxa-48-like carbapenemases in the uk.
AB  == objectives: to characterize uk clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae producing  oxa-48-like carbapenemases and to compare their resistance plasmids. methods: twenty-six enterobacteria producing oxa-48-like enzymes were studied. these were  from 22 diverse hospitals in the uk. isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella  pneumoniae were assigned to clonal lineages by multilocus sequence typing. carbapenemase genes and their genetic environments were characterized by pcr and  sequencing. resistance plasmids were transferred by transformation or conjugation and compared by restriction analysis and pcr for genes encoding critical plasmid  functions. results: thirteen isolates of k. pneumoniae, 10 e. coli and 2 enterobacter cloacae harboured a classical bla(oxa-48) gene; the k. pneumoniae isolates belonged to 11 sequence types (sts) and the e. coli to 7 sts, including  st131 and st38. the bla(oxa-48) genes were located within either tn1999 or tn1999.2 transposons on related approximately 50 kb or approximately 62 kb plasmids, which lacked other resistance genes or, in one isolate, on an approximately 140 kb plasmid that also encoded oxa-9 and ctx-m group-9 beta-lactamases. one india-linked k. pneumoniae isolate had a bla(oxa-181) gene in association with an isecp1 insertion sequence on a 7 kb plasmid. conclusions:  horizontal transfer of related plasmids has facilitated the spread of oxa-48 carbapenemase into multiple strains of several enterobacteriaceae species. the clonal diversity of the producers suggests repeated introduction into the uk. low carbapenem mics for some producers complicates detection and creates a risk for unrecognized spread.

AB  == mobile drug-resistance genes with identical nucleic acid sequences carried by multidrug-resistant escherichia coli strains that cause community-acquired infections are becomingly increasingly dispersed worldwide. over a 2-year period, we analysed gram-negative bacterial (gnb) pathogens from the blood of inpatients  at an urban public hospital to determine what proportion of these isolates carried such globally dispersed drug-resistance genes. of 376 gnb isolates, 167 (44 %) were escherichia coli, 50 (13 %) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 25 (7 %) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 25 (7 %) were proteus mirabilis and 20 (5 %) were enterobacter cloacae; the remainder (24 %) comprised 26 different gnb species. among e. coli isolates, class 1 integrons were detected in 64 (38 %). the most common integron gene cassette configuration was dfra17-aada5, found in 30 (25 %)  of 119 drug-resistant e. coli isolates and in one isolate of moraxella morganii.  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genes were found in 16 e. coli isolates (10 %). these genes with identical sequences were found in nearly 40 % of bloodstream e. coli isolates in the study hospital, as well as in a variety of bacterial species from clinical and non-clinical sources worldwide. thus, a substantial proportion of bloodstream infections among hospitalized patients were caused by e. coli strains carrying drug-resistance genes that are dispersed globally in a wide variety of bacterial species.

AB  == seven enterobacter cloacae isolates and seven klebsiella pneumoniae isolates harbouring a phenotype compatible with the production of a metallo-beta-lactamase were recovered between 2009 and 2011 in three intensive care units of hospital vall d'hebron (barcelona, spain). the presence of bla(vim), bla(imp), bla(ndm), bla(ctx-m), aac(6')-ib, qnra, qnrb and qnrs genes was screened by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing. clonal relatedness of the isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and, in the case of k. pneumoniae isolates, by multilocus sequence typing (mlst). pcr-based replicon typing, southern hybridisation, plasmid double-locus sequence typing and mob relaxase classification methods were used to identify and characterise the plasmids carrying the resistance genes. transferability of the identified plasmids was tested by conjugation assays. all 14 isolates were found to carry bla(vim-1), bla(ctx-m-9) (except one isolate), aac(6')-ib and qnra genes. clonality assessment demonstrated that e. cloacae isolates were distributed in three clonal clusters, whereas all of the k. pneumoniae isolates belonged to one  unique clone, identified as sequence type st252. all studied isolates harboured a large conjugative inchi2 mob(h11) plasmid carrying all of the detected resistance genes. plasmid dna analysis showed that all of them belonged to the st1 inchi2 plasmid cluster and shared the same relaxase partial sequence. in conclusion, the present study describes the dissemination within a hospital of multiresistant e.  cloacae and k. pneumoniae isolates producing vim-1. a complex clonal epidemiology of the e. cloacae isolates was observed and plasmid dna analysis strongly supports horizontal exchanges of the same inchi2 plasmid between different strains and species.

TI  == targeting pan-resistant bacteria with antibodies to a broadly conserved surface polysaccharide expressed during infection.
AB  == background: new therapeutic targets for antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens  are desperately needed. the bacterial surface polysaccharide poly-beta-(1-6)-n-acetyl-glucosamine (pnag) mediates biofilm formation by some bacterial species, and antibodies to pnag can confer protective immunity. by analyzing sequenced genomes, we found that potentially multidrug-resistant bacterial species such as klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and the burkholderia cepacia complex (bcc) may be able to produce pnag. among patients with cystic fibrosis patients, highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the bcc have emerged as problematic pathogens, providing an impetus to study the potential of pnag to be targeted for immunotherapy against pan-resistant bacterial pathogens. methods: the presence of pnag on bcc was assessed using a combination of bacterial genetics, microscopy, and immunochemical approaches. antibodies to pnag were tested using opsonophagocytic assays and for protective efficacy against lethal peritonitis in mice. results: pnag is expressed in vitro and in vivo by the bcc, and cystic fibrosis patients infected by the bcc species b. dolosa mounted a pnag-specific opsonophagocytic antibody response. antisera to pnag mediated opsonophagocytic killing of bcc and were protective against lethal bcc peritonitis even during coinfection with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. conclusions: our findings raise potential new therapeutic options against pnag-producing bacteria, including even pan-resistant pathogens.

AB  == background: six years after initiating a monthly antibiotic cycling protocol in the surgical intensive care unit (sicu), we retrospectively reviewed antibiogram-derived sensitivities of predominant gram-negative pathogens before and after antibiotic cycling. we also examined susceptibility patterns in the medical intensive care unit (micu) where antibiotic cycling is not practiced. materials and methods: antibiotic cycling protocol was implemented in the sicu starting in 2003, with monthly rotation of piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastin, and ceftazidime. sicu antibiogram data from positive clinical  cultures for years 2000 and 2002 were included in the pre-cycling period, and those from 2004 to 2009 in the cycling period. results: profiles of sicu pseudomonal isolates before (n = 116) and after (n = 205) implementing antibiotic cycling showed statistically significant improvements in susceptibility to ceftazidime (66% versus 81%; p = 0.003) and piperacillin/tazobactam (75% versus 85%; p = 0.021), while susceptibility to imipenem remained unaltered (70% in each case; p = 0.989). susceptibility of e. coli isolates to piperacillin/tazobactam improved significantly (46% versus 83%; p < 0.0005), trend analysis showing this  improvement to persist over the study period (p = 0.025). similar findings were not observed in the micu. review of 2004-2009 antibiotic prescription practices showed monthly heterogeneity in the sicu, and a 2-fold higher prescribing of piperacillin/tazobactam in the micu (p < 0.0001). conclusions: six years into antibiotic cycling, we found either steady or improved susceptibilities of clinically relevant gram-negative organisms in the sicu. how much of this effect  is from cycling is unknown, but the antibiotic heterogeneity provided by this practice justifies its ongoing use.

TI  == fecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae: a hidden reservoir  in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients.
AB  == fecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) has not been extensively investigated, except in the cases of selected patients at risk, mostly during outbreaks. a total of 1,100 fecal samples randomly collected in our institution in two different periods in 2006 (n = 600) and 2009-2010 (n = 500) from hospitalized (26.8%) and nonhospitalized (73.2%) patients were screened for  cpe. the first period coincided with an outbreak of vim-1-producing enterobacteriaceae, and the second one coincided with the emergence of kpc enzymes in our hospital. diluted samples in saline were cultured in luria-bertani broth with 1 mug/ml imipenem and subcultured in macconkey agar plates with 4 mug/ml ceftazidime. growing colonies were screened for cpe (modified hodge test and edta and boronic acid synergy tests). carbapenemase genes, plasmids in which  they are located, and clonal relatedness were determined. individuals who exhibited fecal carriage of cpe (11/1,043, 1.1%; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.53 to 1.88) included 8 hospitalized (carriage rate, 2.9%; 95% ci, 1.24 to 5.55) and 3 nonhospitalized patients (carriage rate, 0.4%; 95% ci, 0.08 to 1.14), the latter being identified in 2009. eighty-two percent of colonized patients were not infected with cpe. isolates harboring bla(vim-1) with or without bla(shv-12)  were identified as klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 8; st39, st688, st253, and st163),  enterobacter cloacae (n = 3; two pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge] types),  escherichia coli (n = 2; st155 and st2441), and citrobacter freundii (n = 1). some of these lineages had previously been detected in our institution. the bla(vim-1) gene was a member of the class 1 integrons in110 (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-aada1) and in113 (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-dhfrii) located on plasmids  incn (n = 11; 30 to 50 kb) and inchi2 (n = 3; 300 kb), respectively. dissemination of bla(vim-1) class-1 integrons within highly transferable plasmids in a polyclonal population has potentially contributed to the maintenance and spread of cpe.

TI  == temporal variation of microbiological and chemical quality of noncarbonated bottled drinking water sold in sri lanka.
AB  == use of bottled water in sri lanka has increased over the last decade, while new brands of bottled water are often introduced to the market. however, the manufacturers' adherence to bottled water regulations is questionable, raising concerns regarding the quality of bottled water. the objective of the current study was to investigate the microbiological and chemical quality of bottled water in sri lanka. thirty bottled water brands were sampled and their chemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed. microbiological analysis was carried out within 1 to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to 9, and 9 to 12 mo after the date of manufacture. the results indicated that 63% of brands tested exceeded the levels  permitted by the sri lanka standards institution (slsi) for presumptive total coliforms (tc) (<10 cfu per 100 ml) whereas 97% brands exceeded the world health  organization (who) permitted level. thirty percent of brands exceeded the limit for presumptive fecal coliforms (fc) (0 cfu per 100 ml in accordance with who permitted levels, slsi and the sri lanka health ministry requirement). eighty percent of brands showed higher heterotrophic plate counts (hpc) which exceeded the who guidelines for bottled drinking water. throughout their shelf life, the counts of tc, fc, and hpc bacteria decreased. bacteria identified were klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pasteurella haemolytica, the most frequently being p. aeruginosa. the dominant fungi identified were aspergillus sp. and penicillium sp. inorganic chemical parameters were within permitted levels for all brands except for initial content of ammonia. the results of this study show the need for the bottling industry to  be monitored closely by relevant authorities, in order to provide safe bottled drinking water to consumers in sri lanka.

TI  == complications of port-a-cath(r) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  == background: red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (scd). however, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (cvcs) in adult patients with moderate or severe scd. aims: to review our experience with the use of the port-a-cath((r)) device in sixteen patients with scd undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. methods: among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen scd  patients required the insertion of a port-a-cath((r)) device. these patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- sd]. a  total of 24 port-a-cath((r)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. results: out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. the organisms involved were candida spp. (3), c. parapsilosis (2), c. albicans (1), c. famata (1), c. lusitanice (1), staphylococcus spp. (6), and s. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic streptococcus (1), diphtheroid bacilli (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), ps. spp. (3), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), klebsiella spp. (1), serratia liquefaciens (1), serratia fanticola (1), achromobacter spp. (2) chromobacterium violaceum (1), delftia acidovirans (1), stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), alcaligenes faecalis (1), and enterobacter cloacae (1). two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. one case presented with right atrial thrombosis/svc syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. the median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). the rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. discussion: our results suggest that patients with scd suffer infective complications associated  with the port-a-cath((r)), which often necessitate its removal. although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.

TI  == multi-centre evaluation of a phenotypic extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection guideline in the routine setting.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in enterobacteriaceae, recommending esbl confirmation with etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive esbl screen test (i.e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime mic >1 mg/l or an automated system esbl warning). twenty laboratories submitted 443 enterobacteriaceae with a positive esbl screen test and their confirmation test result (74%escherichia coli, 12%enterobacter cloacae, 8%klebsiella pneumoniae, 3%proteus mirabilis, 2%klebsiella oxytoca). presence of esbl genes was used as reference test. accuracy of local phenotypic esbl detection was 88%.  the positive predictive value (ppv) of local screen tests was 70%, and differed per method (vitek-2: 69%, phoenix: 68%, disc diffusion: 92%), and species (95%k.  pneumoniae-27%k. oxytoca). a low ppv (3%) was observed for isolates with automated system alarm but third-generation cephalosporin mics <2 mg/l. local esbl confirmation had a ppv and negative predictive value (npv) of 93% and 90%, respectively. compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7% of local tests were misinterpreted. combination disc was more specific than etest (91% versus 61%). confirmation tests were not reliable for p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca (ppv 33% and 38%, respectively, although npvs were 100%). in conclusion, performance of etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic esbl confirmation of p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic esbl confirmation, and by interpreting  isolates with a positive esbl alarm but an mic <2 mg/l for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as esbl-negative.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections after liver transplantation - spectrum and risk factors.
AB  == objectives: gram-negative bacilli infections, especially multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli infections, are the leading cause of high mortality after liver transplantation. this study sought to investigate the type of infection, infection rate, pathogenic spectrum, antibiotic-resistance profile, risk factors, and epidemiology of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infection. methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted and data of 217 liver transplant patients receiving cadaveric livers between january 2007 and april 2010 were analyzed. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration test. extended-spectrum and metallo-beta-lactamase assays were used to analyze beta-lactamase-produced isolates, and repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction was used to differentiate bacterium subspecies. results: sixty-seven isolates of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 66 infected liver transplant patients. stenotrophomonas maltophilia (100%, 8/8), klebsiella pneumoniae (61.5%, 8/13), enterobacter cloacae (75%, 3/4) and escherichia coli (81.3%, 13/16) were the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacilli. metallo-beta-lactamase expressing isolates were identified as s. maltophilia (100%, 8/8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (83.3%, 5/6), acinetobacter baumannii (95%, 19/20). significant independent risk factors for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infection were extended use of pre-transplant broad-spectrum antibiotics (or 9.027, p=0.001) and prolonged (>==72h) endotracheal intubation (or 3.537, p=0.033). conclusions: to reduce the risk of acquiring mdr gram-negative bacillus infections after liver transplant, control measures are required to limit the use of prophylactic antibiotic in preventing infection during liver transplant and to shorten endotracheal intubation time.

TI  == chromate-resistance genes in plasmids from antibiotic-resistant nosocomial enterobacterial isolates.
AB  == the presence of chromate-resistance genes in enterobacteria was evaluated in a collection of 109 antibiotic-resistant nosocomial isolates from nine major cities in mexico. results were compared with the presence of mercury-resistance genes. susceptibility tests showed that 21% of the isolates were resistant to chromate (cr(r)), whereas 36% were resistant to mercury (hg(r)). cr(r) levels were high in klebsiella pneumoniae (61%), low in enterobacter cloacae (12%) and escherichia coli (4%), and null in salmonella sp. isolates. colony hybridization demonstrated that the majority of metal-resistant isolates hybridized with chra gene (87% of cr(r) isolates), encoding a chr transporter homologue, and mera gene (74% of hg(r) isolates), encoding mera mercuric reductase, suggesting that most isolates  expressed these widespread metal-resistance systems. southern blot hybridization  of cr(r) isolates showed that plasmids of 80, 85, and 95 kb from k. pneumoniae isolates, and of 100 kb from an e. cloacae isolate, contained chra-related sequences. these plasmids belonged to incn or incp incompatibility groups, and conferred cr(r), as well as multiple antibiotic resistance, when transferred by conjugation to an e. coli standard strain. these data indicated that cr(r) genes  may be distributed among clinical enterobacteria via conjugative plasmids, probably by coselection with antibiotic-resistant genes.

TI  == role of antibiofilm-antimicrobial agents in controlling device-related infections.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of n-acetylcysteine (nac) on organism viability in planktonic and biofilm phases, biofilm thickness, and extracellular polysaccharide content. methods: we performed time-kill curves and broth macrodilution assays of bacterial and fungal clinical isolates with varying concentrations of nac. we also created in vitro bacterial biofilms, incubated them with nac or control, and then stained with propidium iodide and fitc-labeled concanavalin a. we measured biofilm thickness, number of non-viable cells, and fluorescent intensity as a marker of extracellular matrix via a confocal laser scanning microscope. all experiments were conducted in triplicate. tested organisms included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa, mrsa), s. epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans and c. krusei. results: nac 80 mg/ml was uniformly bactericidal (>99.9%  reduction) against all tested bacteria with no recoverable organisms after 30 minutes of incubation, but was fungistatic against candida species. minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of nac ranged from 5-10 mg/ml. biofilm thickness was significantly decreased in nac-treated biofilms for all organisms except vre. the number of non-viable cells in nac-treated gram-positive biofilms  was increased (p<0.05 for mrsa and vre). nac-treated gram-negative biofilms had scant cellularity and lacked complex 3-dimensional structures that were characteristic of controls. fluorescent intensity was similar in the experimental and control arms. conclusions: nac is bactericidal against clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria and also leads to biofilm disruption. nac has the potential for use as a novel agent for prevention or treatment of biofilm-related infections.

TI  == impact of solvent/detergent treatment of plasma on transfusion-relevant bacteria.
AB  == background: a solvent/detergent (s/d) treatment in a medical device has been developed for pathogen reduction of plasma for transfusion. impact of s/d on bacterial growth and on the capacity of complement to kill bacteria has been investigated in this study. study design and methods: a pool of apheresis plasma  from four donors was spiked with eight transfusion-relevant bacteria. plasma was  treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% triton x-45 at 31 degrees c for 90  min and then extracted by oil at 31 degrees c for 70 min. decomplemented plasma and phosphate buffer saline were used as controls. bacterial count was determined in samples taken immediately after spiking, or after s/d and oil treatment. similar experiments were conducted using three individual recovered plasma donations. bacteria growth inhibition tests were performed using discs soaked with plasma samples whether containing the s/d agents or not. results: the mean reduction factors of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae due to complement during s/d treatment were >8.75, 4.71, and 4.18 log  in pooled plasma and >7.42, 2.24 and >6.08 log in individual plasmas, respectively. bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis were inactivated by s/d (>7.04 and 1.60 log in pooled, and >6.06 and 2.39 in individual plasmas, respectively). staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter cloacae did not multiply during s/d treatment of plasma. growth inhibition tests  revealed an inhibition of three gram-negative bacteria by complement and all gram-positive by s/d. conclusion: the s/d treatment of plasma does not alter the  bactericidal activity of complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == [investigation of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients].
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa which is widely found in the environment, may lead to serious nosocomial infections. due to its intrinsic resistance to many antibacterial agents, treatment of p.aeruginosa infections usually present difficulty. quinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, are crutial antibiotics for the treatment of p.aeruginosa infections. however resistance developing to quinolones may become an important problem. resistance to quinolones is often a result of chromosomal mutations and by the effect of efflux pumps. recently plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance have been reportedin the members of enterobacteriaceae family. the gene responsible for this resistance is called qnr. in addition to qnr genes there is also another gene called aac(6)-ib-cr responsible for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and aminoglycoside resistance. limited studies which to screen p.aeruginosa strains for the presence of qnr gene region, revealed no positivity. the aim of this study was to investigate the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in p.aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. a total of 110 p.aeruginosa strains isolated from respiratory tract specimens from the patients were included in the  study. ciprofloxacin susceptibilities of the isolates were detected by kirby-bauer disk diffusion method according to clsi guidelines. the presence of qnra, qnrb, qnrc, qnrs and aac(6')-ib-cr genes were searched by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with the use of specific individual primer pairs. as positive control strains, escherichia coli j53 pmg252 (qnra1 positive), e.coli j53 pmg252 (qnrs1 positive), e.coli j53 pmg258 (qnrb1 and aac(6')-ib-cr positive), klebsiella pneumoniae ref.15 (qnrb positive), enterobacter cloacae ref.287 (qnrs positive), e.coli ref.20 (qnra positive) and e.coli dh10 conjugated with phs11 plasmid (qnrc positive) were used. of 110 p.aeruginosa clinical isolates, 13 were found resistant to ciprofloxacin, while 7 were intermediate. however multiplex pcr yielded no positivity in terms of qnra, qnrb, qnrc, qnrs and aac(6')-ib-cr gene regions. in conclusion, although our results indicated that none of the tested p.aeruginosa strains harboured those genes, further multicenter studies with large numbers of isolates are needed to confirm these results.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of beta-lactamase inhibition by nxl104 in combination with ceftaroline: examining organisms with multiple types of beta-lactamases.
AB  == new broad-spectrum beta-lactamases such as kpc enzymes and ctx-m-15 enzymes threaten to markedly reduce the utility of our armamentarium of beta-lactam agents, even our most potent drugs, such as carbapenems. nxl104 is a broad-spectrum non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor. in this evaluation, we examined organisms carrying defined beta-lactamases and identified doses and schedules of nxl104 in combination with the new cephalosporin ceftaroline, which  would maintain good bacterial cell kill and suppress resistance emergence for a clinically relevant period of 10 days in our hollow-fiber infection model. we examined three strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and one isolate of enterobacter cloacae. k. pneumoniae 27-908m carried kpc-2, shv-27, and tem-1 beta-lactamases.  its isogenic mutant, k. pneumoniae 4207j, was "cured" of the plasmid expressing the kpc-2 enzyme. k. pneumoniae 24-1318a carried a ctx-m-15 enzyme, and e. cloacae 2-77c expressed a stably derepressed ampc chromosomal beta-lactamase. dose-ranging experiments for nxl104 administered as a continuous infusion with ceftaroline at 600 mg every 8 h allowed identification of a 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (auc) for nxl104 that mediated bactericidal activity and resistance suppression. dose fractionation experiments identified that "time > threshold" was the pharmacodynamic index linked to cell kill and resistance suppression. given these results, we conclude that nxl104 combined with ceftaroline on an 8-hourly administration schedule would be optimal for circumstances in which highly resistant pathogens are likely to be encountered. this combination dosing regimen should allow for optimal bacterial cell kill (highest likelihood of successful clinical outcome) and the suppression of resistance emergence.

TI  == prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and its association with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and ampc beta-lactamase in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: we investigated the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and its association with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) and ampc beta-lactamase in enterobacteriaceae. methods: a total of 347 non-duplicated isolates of enterobacteriaceae were collected between august and october 2006 from 2 hospitals. qnr determinant screening was conducted using pcr amplification, and all positive results were confirmed by direct sequencing. qnr-positive strains were determined on the basis of the presence of esbl and ampc beta-lactamase genes. results: the qnr gene was detected in 47 of 347 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates. among the 47 qnr-positive strains, klebsiella pneumoniae (n=29) was the most common, followed by escherichia coli (n=6), enterobacter cloacae (n=6), citrobacter freundii (n=5), and enterobacter aerogenes (n=1). these isolates were identified as qnra1 (n=6), 8 qnrb subtypes (n=40), and qnrs1 (n=1). at least 1 esbl was detected in 38 of the 47 qnr-positive strains. qnr-positive strains also showed high positive rates of esbl or ampc beta-lactamase, such as tem, shv, ctx-m, and dha. dha-1 was detected in 23 of 47 qnr-positive strains, and this was co-produced with 1 qnra1 and 22 qnrb4. strains harboring mir-1t and cmy were also detected among the qnr-positive strains. antimicrobial-resistance rates of qnr-positive strains to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, and moxifloxacin were 51.1%, 46.8%, 46.8%, 74.5%, and 53.2%, respectively. conclusions: the qnr genes were highly prevalent in enterobacteriaceae, primarily the qnrb subtypes. they were closely associated with ebsl and ampc beta-lactamase.

TI  == clinical pharmacokinetics of meropenem and biapenem in bile and dosing considerations for biliary tract infections based on site-specific pharmacodynamic target attainment.
AB  == the present study investigated the pharmacokinetics of meropenem and biapenem in  bile and estimated their pharmacodynamic target attainment at the site. meropenem (0.5 g) or biapenem (0.3 g) was administered to surgery patients (n = 8 for each  drug). venous blood samples and hepatobiliary tract bile samples were obtained at the end of infusion (0.5 h) and for up to 5 h thereafter. drug concentrations in  plasma and bile were analyzed pharmacokinetically and used for a monte carlo simulation to predict the probability of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (40% of the time above the mic). both drugs penetrated similarly into bile, with  mean bile/plasma ratios of 0.24 to 0.25 (maximum drug concentration) and 0.30 to  0.38 (area under the drug concentration-time curve). the usual regimens of meropenem (0.5 g every 8 h [q8h]) and biapenem (0.3 g q8h) (0.5-h infusions) achieved similar target attainment probabilities in bile (>/= 90%) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae isolates. however, against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, meropenem at 1 g q8h and biapenem at 0.6 g q8h were required for values of 80.7% and 71.9%, respectively.  the biliary pharmacodynamic-based breakpoint (the highest mic at which the target attainment probability in bile was >/= 90%) was 1 mg/liter for 0.5 g q8h and 2 mg/liter for 1 g q8h for meropenem and 0.5 mg/liter for 0.3 g q8h and 1 mg/liter  for 0.6 g q8h for biapenem. these results help to define the clinical pharmacokinetics of the two carbapenems in bile while also helping to rationalize and optimize the dosing regimens for biliary tract infections based on site-specific pharmacodynamic target attainment.

TI  == bile culture and susceptibility testing of malignant biliary obstruction via ptbd.
AB  == purpose: to assess the information obtained by bile culture and susceptibility testing for malignant biliary obstruction by a retrospective one-center study. methods: a total of 694 patients with malignant biliary obstruction received percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage during the period july 2003 to september 2010, and subsequently, bile specimens were collected during the procedure. among the 694 patients, 485 were men and 209 were women, ranging in age from 38 to 78 years (mean age 62 years). results: a total of 42.9% patients had a positive bile culture (298 of 694). further, 57 species of microorganisms and 342 strains were identified; gram-positive bacteria accounted for 50.9% (174  of 342) and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 41.5% (142 of 342) of these strains. no anaerobes were obtained by culture during this study. the most common microorganisms were enterococcus faecalis (41 of 342, 11.9%), escherichia coli (34 of 342, 9.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (28 of 342, 8.2%), staphylococcus epidermidis (19 of 342, 5.5%), enterococcus (18 of 342, 5.3%), and enterobacter cloacae (16 of 342, 4.7%). the percentage of beta-lactamase-producing gram-positive bacteria was 27.6% (48 of 174), and the percentage of gram-negative bacteria was 19.7% (28 of 142). the percentage of enzyme-producing escherichia coli was 61.7% (21 of 34). conclusion: the bile cultures in malignant biliary obstruction are different from those in the tokyo guidelines and other benign biliary obstruction researches, which indicates that a different antibacterial therapy should be applied. thus, knowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibility data could aid in the better use of antibiotics for the empirical therapy of biliary infection combined with malignant biliary obstruction.

TI  == epidemiology and molecular characterisation of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in a university hospital intensive care unit in greece.
AB  == the molecular epidemiology of vim-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated at the beginning of an epidemic in the intensive care unit (icu) of a university hospital in athens, greece, was studied. all gram-negative organisms isolated from march 2004 to november 2005 positive for metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) production were submitted to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing, to repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) for molecular typing, and to s1 nuclease  digestion for plasmid dna characterisation. conjugation experiments and isoelectric focusing were performed to identify co-existing beta-lactamases. amongst 23 patients, 12 suffered one or more clinical infections. eighty-two isolates representing one isolate per clone, source and icu patient were studied, including klebsiella pneumoniae (77), enterobacter cloacae (2), citrobacter freundii (1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2). high clonal diversity was detected amongst the k. pneumoniae, with 10 distinct clones identified. conjugation was successful in 54.5% of k. pneumoniae, and five different-sized plasmids were detected. all k. pneumoniae and both e. cloacae isolates shared the same bla(vim-1)-containing class 1 integron structure also carrying aaca7, dhfri and aada1 gene cassettes. the c. freundii isolate carried a different integron that included bla(vim-1) and aac(6')-iic. both p. aeruginosa isolates were positive for bla(vim-2). it was not possible to identify specific clones with the potential to cause clinical infections. in conclusion, a multiclonal cluster of mbl-producers was responsible for the first cases of colonisation and/or infection in the icu. a single integron structure, common in greek hospitals, efficiently disseminated between clones and species, suggesting that the epidemic was mainly the result of successful horizontal transfer of mobile genetic material rather than the result of horizontal transfer of one or a few clones.

TI  == molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from the philippines.
AB  == beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and ampc beta-lactamases, are major resistance mechanisms of enterobacteriaceae. emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (pmqr) determinants in esbl-producing isolates poses a global threat. the molecular characterisitcs of esbl and pmqr determinants in the philippines are not well characterized. in this study, we investigated esbls and ampc beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from the philippines, and analyzed the association between esbl and pmqr genes. a total of 91 amoxicilin non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae  were collected at the research institute for tropical medicine of the philippines from 2006 to 2008. ampc- or esbl-producing isolates were screened by detecting a  zone diameter for cefoxitin </= 14 mm or cefpodoxime </= 20 mm, respectively. possible esbl-producing strains were assessed by the esbl confirmation test of the clinical and laboratory standards institute. pcr and sequencing were performed to detect the esbl and pmqr genes. the number of esbl-producers and ampc-producers confirmed phenotypically was 17 (18.7%) and 61 (67.0%), respectively. of 17 phenotypic esbl-producers, 14 isolates had esbl genes, including 6 of escherichia coli, 3 of enterobacter cloacae, 2 of enterobacter aerogenes, 2 of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 of klebsiella ozaenae. among these isolates, there were 13, 4, and 12 with bla(ctx-m), bla(shv), and bla(tem), respectively. of the bla(ctx-m)-positive isolates, bla(ctx-m-15) shows the highest prevalence, followed by bla(ctx-m-3) and bla(ctx-m-14). of 14 esbl-producers identified by pcr, 4, 6, and 7 isolates were positive for qnrb, qnrs, and aac(6')-ib-cr, respectively. the frequency of aac(6')-ib-cr positivity  was significantly higher among ctx-m-15-producing isolates. thus, we identified bla(ctx-m), aac(6')-ib-cr, and qnr in esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae from the  philippines, and revealed a significant association between bla(ctx-m-15) and aac(6')-ib-cr. local epidemiological data are important for implementing appropriate antimicrobial therapy and effective infection control measures. continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance genes in the philippines will be required.

AB  == chromagar kpc was evaluated with 53 carbapenem-nonsusceptible strains. kpc-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae grew efficiently and yielded metallic blue colonies (100% sensitivity). poor or no growth or atypical  colony color were evident with kpc-producing escherichia coli (71.4% sensitivity) and ertapenem-resistant kpc-nonproducing k. pneumoniae (72.7% sensitivity). chromagar kpc appears applicable for processing carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae surveillance specimens, but its performance might possibly be  suboptimal in the presence of kpc-negative ertapenem-resistant strains or for detection of kpc-producing e. coli.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates at a taiwanese hospital: lack of distinctive phenotypes for screening.
AB  == we investigated the prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) among 1,827 enterobacteriaceae isolates collected in 2006 and evaluated the vitek 2 microbiology system, modified hodge test, and 2 combined disk tests as the screening tools for mbls by using these isolates and 77 previously characterized  imp-8 producers. the imp-8 mbl was identified in 18 isolates of 2006, and the imp-8-positive isolates represented 0.2%, 1.1%, and 5.0% of all escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively. only one-third of all mbl producers could be recognized by either vitek 2 or the hodge test. mbl production could be identified in 38 (40%) of the 95 imp-8-producing isolates by the combined disk test using meropenem disks supplemented by phenylboronic acid and edta, and only 2 (2.1%) isolates gave positive results in  the combined disk test using meropenem disks supplemented with dipicolinic acid.  of all imp-8 producers, 37.9%, 50.5%, and 32.6% were nonsusceptible to tigecycline, fluoroquinolones, and both, respectively. in conclusion, this study  demonstrated the lack of distinct phenotypes that could be easily identified among the imp-8-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates at a taiwanese hospital. continuous surveillance and monitoring are needed because the widespread of tigecycline- and fluoroquinolone-coresistant mbl producers may become a serious therapeutic problem.

TI  == colonization of the gut with gram-negative bacilli, its association with neonatal sepsis and its clinical relevance in a developing country.
AB  == this study examined the pattern of colonization of the neonatal gut by aerobic gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and evaluated the association between gut colonization and sepsis in the developing world. this deserves attention because  of the high incidence of sepsis and the differences in hygienic environments in developing countries compared with the developed world. the study was carried out on neonates in a tertiary-care government hospital. serial gut samples were analysed (gastric aspirates and stool samples) for gnb. blood samples of cases showing clinical signs of sepsis were also analysed for septic screening and culture positivity. antibiograms, serotyping and pfge were carried out to evaluate the relatedness of the gut and blood isolates. a diverse array of gnb was isolated from the gut of the neonates, klebsiella pneumoniae being most common, followed by escherichia coli. the rate of isolation of gnb was consistently higher in stool samples compared with gastric aspirate samples. colonization was influenced by a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and by  the prolonged use of a feeding tube. gnb were the cause of sepsis in the majority of cases, with k. pneumoniae being the most frequently isolated gnb from the blood. acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and burkholderia cepacia were the other gnb recovered from the blood of the neonates. neonates with gnb in the gut had a higher incidence of clinical sepsis than those without. in 50 % of cases, the genotypes of the organisms found in the blood were indistinguishable from their gut counterpart. these results show that the neonatal gut is colonized with a diverse array of gnb, and an association between gut colonization and neonatal sepsis was observed.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance of gram negative bacilli isolated from tertiary-care hospitals in colombia].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial resistance has been identified as one of the major public health problems worldwide. to facilitate its control, bacterial resistance levels must be monitored permanently by effective surveillance systems. objective: to describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram negative bacilli in colombian hospitals over a 3-year period. materials and methods: this  descriptive study used the bacterial susceptibility profiles provided by 14 tertiary-care hospitals belonging to the colombian nosocomial resistance study group. the hospitals were located in 7 major cities in colombia, and provided records over the period january 2006 to december 2008. using whonet 5.4, the antimicrobial resistance patterns were described for the enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenters (pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii). comparisons  were made in the bacterial responses to selected antibiotics in samples from general wards and from adult intensive care units. results: the antimicrobial resistance frequencies of several enterobacteriaceae species showed a decreasing  trend. in contrast, p. aeruginosa was demonstrated to be a multidrug-resistance organism with increasing resistance frequencies. conclusions: these data emphasize the importance of surveillance programs in detecting presence of multidrug-resistant organisms. this information will aid the implementation of protocols aimed to strengthen the infection control strategies and antibiotic stewardship in each hospital.

TI  == mucosal surveillance cultures in predicting gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the spectrum and time course of gut and nasopharyngeal colonization with gram-negative micro-organisms, and to define the value of surveillance cultures in predicting late-onset sepsis in neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units. nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected on admission and twice weekly thereafter in 278 neonates admitted within the first 72 h of life with risk factors of early-onset sepsis. sterile body fluid cultures were obtained on admission and subsequently as clinically indicated. approximately half of the rectal (693/1250, 55%) and nasopharyngeal (558/1153, 48%) samples but only 6% (32/555) of the sterile fluid samples in 26 patients were culture positive for gram-negative organisms. in total, 2108 invasive and mucosal culture pairs were analysed. the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a mucosal sample to predict late-onset sepsis were 27%, 66%, 4% and 94%, respectively. patients with  pre-existing colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.011), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.002), escherichia coli (p = 0.003), stenotrophomonas spp. (p = 0.003) and pseudomonas spp. (p </= 0.001) were more likely to develop late-onset  sepsis. no such association was found for acinetobacter baumannii, serratia spp.  or enterobacter cloacae. in conclusion, routine mucosal cultures are inefficient  for the prediction of gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care  units. however, targeted screening for specific organisms in an outbreak (e.g. klebsiella spp., e. coli, stenotrophomonas spp. and pseudomonas spp.) may offer an opportunity to improve infection control measures and enable timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == comparative activity of tigecycline and tetracycline on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria revealed by a multicentre study in four north european countries.
AB  == background: this study involves a multicentre surveillance of tigecycline and tetracycline activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from primary care centres (pccs), general hospital wards (ghws) and intensive care units (icus) in denmark (n = 9), finland (n = 10), norway (n = 7) and sweden (n = 19). methods: the hospitals were each asked to test 30 consecutive gram-positive  and 30 gram-negative clinical isolates. supportive information accompanying each  isolate included the study centre, ward level (pcc, ghw, or icu), patient identification and source of the isolate. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for tetracycline and tigecycline were determined with the etest. results:  the isolates collected comprised 1610 gram-negative and 1767 gram-positive clinical isolates. the study showed low rates of non-susceptibility (intermediate (i) and resistant (r)) to tigecycline: <1% in escherichia coli, though other enterobacteriaceae showed higher rates (enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and serratia spp. (23%)). the overall non-susceptibility rate for tigecycline in enterobacteriaceae with species-related breakpoints for tigecycline was 6% (4% excluding serratia spp.). the activity of tigecycline against haemophilus influenzae and acinetobacter spp. was high with a mic(50) of  0.25 mg/l and mic(90) of 1 mg/l. the prevalence of non-susceptibility to tigecycline among gram-positive bacteria was <1%. the corresponding figure for tetracycline was 14%. the activity of tigecycline against streptococcus pneumoniae was high with mic(50) and mic(90) of 0.125 mg/l. conclusion: tigecycline showed good overall in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates, including both tetracycline-susceptible and resistant isolates. most non-susceptibility to tigecycline among enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli was i (6%), rather than r (<1%). this indicates a problem setting interpretive species-related tigecycline breakpoints for enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli.

TI  == [validity of using imipenem as a representative carbapenems and levofloxacin as a representative fluoroquinolones in antibiotics susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == in antimicrobial susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae, the efficacies of carpapenems are predicted by the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of imipenem, and that of fluoroquinolones are predicted by the mic of levofloxacin.  to assess its judgement, we compared the mics of imipenem, meropenem, panipenem,  and doripenem for carbapenems, and ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tosufloxacin and  pazufloxacin for fluoroquinolones of clinically isolated enterobacteria, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacterfreundii, those resistant to the third generation cephalosporin. mic distributions in low concentration range are estranged in some strains, conspicuously s. marcescens, e. cloacae and c. freundii: meropenem and doripenem displayed low mic value than imipenem and panipenem. since the estrangements are appeared mic value of less than 8 microg/ml, the interpretive results (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) are not affected. in fluoroquinolones, all 4 agents showed almost identical mic distributions, thus the mic of levofloxacin is accepted to use the reference for  other fluoroquinolones. the existence of the strains harboring carbapenem-resistant gene displaying low mic value of carbapenems was reported. for the sensitive detection of the candidate of carbapenem-resistant strains, cut-off value of each carbapenem should be reconsidered, and also other phonotype analysis should be applied. genomic analysis also would be required to detect the carbapenem-resistant gene.

TI  == bile bacterial flora and its in vitro resistance pattern in patients with acute cholangitis resulting from choledocholithiasis.
AB  == introduction: cholangitis and biliary sepsis are severe infectious diseases, which are often observed in patients with choledocholithiasis. the antimicrobial  therapy is effective if started as soon as the diagnosis is made. therefore, the  profile of bile pathogens and its susceptibility to a number of antibiotics were  evaluated. material and methods: bile cultures and antibiograms from 92 patients  hospitalized between january 2006 and december 2008 in a tertiary referral center for the treatment of biliary and pancreatic diseases (central teaching hospital,  medical university of silesia) were reviewed. specimens were obtained from patients with acute cholangitis and confirmed choledocholithiasis during endoscopic (i.e. ercp) and surgical (i.e. percutaneus transhepatic biliary drainage) procedures. the bile specimens were examined for pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi. results: sixty-five of 92 analyzed cultures were positive. a total of 69 pathogens were isolated: 47 (68.1%) gram-negative bacteria, 18 (26.1%) gram-positive bacteria, 2 (2.9%) anaerobes and 2 (2.9%) candida. the predominant gram-negative pathogens were escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumani complex, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the most effective antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria were imipenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam and cefepime (susceptibility 97.9%, 89.4%, 85.1% and 85.1%, respectively). the expenditure on antibiotics monotherapies and combined therapies was also analyzed. conclusion: our study shows that gram-negative bacteria were the predominant bile pathogens found in patients with acute cholangitis. piperacillin/tazobactam or ceftazidime may be the alternative to ciprofloxacin therapeutic option. the addition of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid to ciprofloxacin could also be considered. however, imipenem should remain a back-up antibiotic in the treatment of acute cholangitis.

TI  == the activity of antimicrobial peptide s-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the activity of s-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. the result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of s-thanatin against all isolates of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella ornithinolytica and klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all mics to gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except enterococcus faecium. s-thanatin was more effective toward gram-negative strains, especially for enterobacter and klebsiella. the mics of s-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (p>0.05). likewise, no notable difference could be observed between e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, k. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to s-thanatin (p>0.05). it was implied that the antimicrobial activity of s-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.

AB  == objectives: carbapenems are the drugs of choice for the treatment of serious infections caused by esbl- and ampc-positive enterobacteriaceae. an increasing trend of resistance to these antibiotics has been observed recently. the aim of the study was to determine resistance to carbapenems in clinical isolates of the  enterobacteriaceae family and its mechanism. methods: between 1 april 2009 and 31 august 2010, enterobacteriaceae were isolated from clinical samples obtained from patients hospitalized in the university hospital olomouc, czech republic (1,406 beds incl. 155 icu beds). the strains were identified using the standard microbiological methods and their susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by the microdilution method. the identification of the isolates with the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of meropenem of 2 mg/l or more was confirmed by the phoenix automated system (becton dickinson). the mic of meropenem was verified by the e-test and also phoenix automated system. the isolates were tested for carbapenemase production using the modified hodge test, a combined test with 3-aminophenylboronic acid (3-apb) and edta, the cd-test for serine carbapenemases and modified ddst (mddst) for metallo-beta-lactamases (mbl). esbl  and ampc production was determined by the mddst and modified ampc test, respectively. genes encoding production of serine carbapenemases, mbl, bla(oxa-23), bla(oxa-48), esbl and ampc enzymes were detected with a set of primers that amplify specific segments of individual beta-lactamases. tem- and shv-positive pcr products were characterized by restriction analysis. results: from a total of 12,605 enterobacteriaceae, 9 strains were isolates with the mic of meropenem of 2 mg/l or more. seven isolates were classified as klebsiella pneumoniae and two as enterobacter cloacae. the mic of meropenem for these strains ranged from 2 mg/l to 16 mg/l. the modified hodge test, the combined test with 3-apb and edta, cd-test, mddst for mbl and a series of pcr analyses did not  detect production of class a carbapenemases, mbl, oxa-23 or oxa-48 enzymes in any of the tested strains. in 6 klebsiella pneumoniae strains and 1 enterobacter cloacae strain, the mddst test and genetic analysis revealed esbl production (ctx-m and shv types), and in 2 strains, ampc production was detected (dha and ebc types). conclusion: the prevalence of the enterobacteriaceae with the mic of  meropenem >/= 2 mg/l in the university hospital olomouc was 0.07 %. none of the strains produced either serine carbapenemases or mbl. borderline resistance of the strains to carbapenems was determined by the esbl and ampc production with another associated mechanism of resistance.

TI  == changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at  a tertiary medical center in northern taiwan. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. the numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third  period, 1999-2005. results: during the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. a significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant s pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. additionally, a significant increase  in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for e coli, enterobacter cloacae, and a baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). however, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005  was found for groups a and b streptococci, non-a, b, d streptococci, and s pneumoniae. conclusion: resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.

TI  == correlation between antibiotic consumption and resistance of gram-negative bacteria causing healthcare-associated infections at a university hospital in taiwan from 2000 to 2009.
AB  == objectives: this study investigated the correlation between antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria causing healthcare-associated infections at a university hospital in taiwan from 2000 to  2009. methods: disc susceptibility data of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus spp., pseudomonas  aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli causing healthcare-associated infections were evaluated. data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days) of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fl uoroquinolones were analysed. results: the trend of total consumption of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones significantly increased between 2000 and 2003 and remained stable between 2004 and 2009. the decreasing use of gentamicin and amikacin in recent years was associated with increasing susceptibility of e. coli, e. cloacae, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa to gentamicin, as well as increasing susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to amikacin. the use of piperacillin/tazobactam was positively correlated with the prevalence  of piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant e. coli and s. maltophilia. in contrast, the use of cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam was negatively correlated with the  prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant e. coli and piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant  s. maltophilia, respectively. the consumption of fluoroquinolones was positively  correlated with the rates of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant p. aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant s. maltophilia. conclusions: the relationship between antibiotic prescription and the rates of resistance for gram-negative bacteria is complicated; every type of  antimicrobial agent or even individual agent can have distinct associations with  different pathogens.

TI  == what remains against carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae? evaluation of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, colistin, fosfomycin, minocycline, nitrofurantoin, temocillin and tigecycline.
AB  == carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae present an increasing and diverse problem, including strains of multiple species with metallo-beta-lactamases (imp, ndm or vim) and non-metallo (kpc and oxa-48) enzymes as well as those combining an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc enzyme with porin loss. most strains, except those with oxa-48 alone, are broadly resistant to beta-lactams and have multiple aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes; those with ndm-1 carbapenemase typically also have 16s rrna methylases, conferring complete aminoglycoside resistance. in this study, the activity of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, colistin, fosfomycin, minocycline, nitrofurantoin, temocillin and  tigecycline was evaluated against 81 carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates from the uk. testing was performed by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) agar dilution method. chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin inhibited <25% of the isolates at the breakpoint, whereas colistin was active against 75/81 isolates (92.6%), the exceptions being four klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae isolates along with members of inherently resistant genera. fosfomycin was active against 49/81 isolates (60.5%), including 7/7 escherichia coli, 16/20 enterobacter and citrobacter spp., but only 25/52 klebsiella spp. tigecycline was active against 38/81 isolates (46.9%) and was intermediate against another 27 (33.3%), with resistance scattered amongst k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. the activity of colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline was unrelated to the isolates' carbapenem resistance mechanisms. temocillin was fully active [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=8 mg/l] against only 4/81 isolates (4.9%), but inhibited a further 22 isolates (27.2%) at the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy (bsac) urinary breakpoint (32 mg/l), predominantly comprising those isolates with combinations of impermeability and an esbl or ampc enzyme, along with 6/11 isolates producing  kpc carbapenemases. studies with transconjugants and transformants confirmed the  small effect of kpc enzymes against temocillin, whereas oxa-48 and ndm-1 conferred clear resistance.

TI  == a novel gene cassette, aaca43, in a plasmid-borne class 1 integron.
AB  == a novel gene cassette, aaca43, was identified in the aadb-aaca43-oxa10-smr2 cassette array in a class 1 integron. like related aminoglycoside-(6')-acetyltransferases, aaca43 confers clinically relevant resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, and some less-used aminoglycosides but not to gentamicin. although transferable on an incl/m plasmid, aaca43 was identified  in only two different klebsiella pneumoniae strains (14 isolates), one escherichia coli strain (2 isolates), and one enterobacter cloacae strain in a survey of patients in a sydney intensive care unit in 2004-2005.

TI  == oxa-163, an oxa-48-related class d beta-lactamase with extended activity toward expanded-spectrum cephalosporins.
AB  == two bla(oxa-48)-like-positive isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) were recovered in argentina in 2008 as part of a large-scale survey focused on multidrug resistance in enterobacteriaceae. in both cases, sequencing  identified beta-lactamase oxa-163, differing from oxa-48 by a single amino substitution and a 4-amino-acid deletion. oxa-163 hydrolyzed penicillins, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime, whereas oxa-48 did not. however, oxa-163 had a much  lower ability to hydrolyze carbapenems than oxa-48, therefore barely being considered a carbapenemase. in both isolates, the bla(oxa-163) gene was located on plasmids that differed in structure and size. however, a detailed genetic analysis revealed a similar genetic context in those isolates, with the bla(oxa-163) gene being bracketed by novel transposase genes, making this genetic environment different from that reported for the bla(oxa-48) gene. this study identified the first class d beta-lactamase compromising both extended-spectrum cephalosporin and carbapenem activities.

TI  == [infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens].
AB  == background: intensive therapy units are the places where pathogens can easily spread. improper antibiotic therapy contributes to the selection of new strains called multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant or pandrug-resistant. for  itu patients, such pathogens are particularly dangerous. case report: the case of a 50-year-old man diagnosed with septic shock after repeated surgeries due to vater's ampulla tumour was described. in blood and peritoneal fluid cultures, enterobacter cloacae esbl and klebsiella pneumoniae were first isolated; then acinetobacter baumannii was also detected. the targeted antibiotic therapy instituted did not bring the expected results. on day 5, tigecycline and imipenem were started and continued over 10 days. after 4 days of combined therapy, bacterial strains were eradicated. the patient was sent to the referring ward in  good condition. conclusion: combined use of imipenem and a new antibiotic - tigecycline provides effective treatment of septic shock in the course of intra-abdominal infection.

TI  == escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter, and proteus
AB  == the gram-negative bacilli of the genera escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter,and proteus(table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. with the exception of proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. a limited number of  species, including e coli, k pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, s marcescens,and p mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. the increasing incidence of the coliforms, proteus, and other gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better  understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (r factors). also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host  defenses.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections in the asia-pacific region according to currently established susceptibility interpretive criteria.
AB  == objectives: the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) was  intended to reveal the evolving profiles of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative pathogens causing intra-abdominal infections (iais) from asia-pacific region in 2009. methods: a total of 3577 aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli associated with iais were collected from 32 centers in 12 countries. the in vitro susceptibilities of these isolates to 12 antimicrobial agents were determined using the broth microdilution method. susceptibility results for selected species of enterobacteriaceae were also compared using different mic interpretive criteria recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2009 (m100-s19), in january 2010 (m100-s20), in june 2010  (m100-s20-u) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing in 2010 (eucast-2010). results: enterobacteriaceae comprised 89.5% of the isolates of which escherichia coli was the most common species (56.7%). enterobacteriaceae showed poor susceptibility to ampicillin-sulbactam in china (25.3%) and india (19%), and to fluoroquinolones in india (23.4%) and china (37.7%). the rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli (36.8%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (26.3%) remained high. the resistance of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae to carbapenems also increased, especially to ertapenem (9.9%). using m100-s20 criteria, 19% of esbl-producing e. coli and 9% of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftazidime; 5% and 10% were  susceptible to cefepime, respectively. using m100-s20-u guidelines, the susceptibility rates of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae (88%) and enterobacter cloacae (69%) to ertapenem were substantially decreased from those determined using m100-s20. conclusions: these up-to-date epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance surveillance data are crucial to select appropriate treatment of iais.

TI  == microbiology and antibiotic susceptibility of organisms in bile cultures from patients with and without cholangitis at an asian academic medical center.
AB  == purpose: to review the epidemiology of microbial isolates from bile cultures taken from patients with and without cholangitis admitted to an asian academic medical center in order to compare antimicrobial sensitivities and to make recommendations for empiric antimicrobial therapy of patients with cholangitis in the philippines. methods: routine aerobic bile culture results and corresponding  clinical abstracts of surgical patients admitted to an academic medical center over a three-year period were analyzed. results: the series consisted of 125 patients, 77 with cholangitis (62%) and 48 (38%) without, which was determined according to the tokyo guidelines. patients with cholangitis were significantly more likely to have positive bile cultures (p = 0.012). gram-negative bacilli were the most common isolates in both patients with (94%) and patients without (95%) cholangitis. for both groups, escherichia coli (36%) had greatest sensitivity to amikacin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, imipenem-cilastatin meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam; klebsiella pneumoniae (16%) had greatest  sensitivity to amikacin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, imipenem-cilastatin meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam; and pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5%) was most sensitive to cefepime, gentamicin, imipenem-cilastatin meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli (or enterobacteriaceae) (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae) were the most common aerobic microbial isolates in bile cultures from patients with cholangitis in the philippines. their antimicrobial susceptibility  patterns suggest that imipenem-cilastatin (sensitivity 100%), meropenem (100%), amikacin (90-100%), cefepime (75%-100%), ceftriaxone (75%-100%), gentamicin (67%-100%), and piperacillin-tazobactam (50%-100%) would be the most effective antimicrobials for both groups. however, the authors echo the caution from the surgical infection society/infectious diseases society of america against using aminoglycosides as empiric drugs when safer and equally effective regimens are available.

TI  == diarrheagenic escherichia coli in acute gastroenteritis in infants in north-west  italy.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli may cause diarrhoea in infancy, but it is not routinely detected and regarded as a major causative agent. the aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic e. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. between march 2008 and june 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for e. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-pcr. e. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic e. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering e. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. the datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 salmonella spp., 8 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 klebsiella oxytoca, 11 citrobacter freundii, 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 serratia spp., 7 enterobacter cloacae, 1 shigella spp., 2 campylobacter spp. rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. it was found in 35 samples (21.88%  of the overall collected samples), while adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn. data provide an interesting epidemiologic survey of enteropathogenic e. coli, which is not usually detected, although it may have  potential clinical implications. abbreviations: cdec, detaching e. coli; daec, diffusely adherent e. coli; eaggec, enteroaggregative e. coli; ehec, enterohaemorrhagic e. coli; eiec, enteroinvasive e. coli; epec, enteropathogenic  e. coli; etec, enterotoxigenic e. coli.

TI  == molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria  isolated from bovine mastitis in egypt.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize the genetic basis of multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis cases in egypt. multidrug resistance phenotypes were found in 34 of 112 (30.4%) gram-negative bacterial isolates, which harbored at least one antimicrobial resistance gene. the most prevalent multidrug-resistant (mdr) species were enterobacter cloacae (8 isolates, 7.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 6.3%), klebsiella oxytoca (7 isolates, 6.3%), escherichia coli (5 isolates, 4.5%), and citrobacter freundii (3 isolates, 2.7%). the most commonly observed resistance phenotypes were against ampicillin (97.0%), streptomycin (94.1%), tetracycline (91.2%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (88.2%), nalidixic acid (85.3%), and chloramphenicol (76.5%). class 1 integrons were detected in 28 (25.0%) isolates. the gene cassettes within class 1 integrons included those encoding resistance to trimethoprim (dfra1, dfra5, dfra7, dfra12, dfra15, dfra17, and dfra25), aminoglycosides (aada1, aada2, aada5, aada7, aada12, aada22, and aac(3)-id), chloramphenicol (cmla), erythromycin (erea2), and rifampicin (arr-3). class 2 integrons were identified in 6 isolates (5.4%) with three different profiles. furthermore, the beta-lactamase encoding genes, bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), and bla(oxa), the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnr and aac(6)-ib-cr, and the florfenicol resistance gene, flor, were also identified. to the best of our knowledge, the results identified class 2 integrons, qnr and aac(6)-ib-cr from cases of mastitis for the first time. this is the first report of molecular characterization for antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis in africa.

TI  == the prevention of biofilm colonization by multidrug-resistant pathogens that cause ventilator-associated pneumonia with antimicrobial-coated endotracheal tubes.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) continues to be the nosocomial infection associated with the highest mortality in critically ill patients. since silver-coated endotracheal tubes (ett) was shown in a multicenter prospective randomized trials to decrease the risk of vap, we compared the efficacy of two antiseptic agents such as gardine- and gendine-coated etts with that of silver-coated etts in preventing biofilm. the etts were tested for their ability  to prevent the biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and candida albicans. scanning electron microscopy studies  revealed a heavy biofilm on uncoated and silver-coated ett but not on the gardine-coated ett. the gardine and gendine etts completely inhibited the formation of biofilms by all organisms tested and were more effective in preventing biofilm growth than the silver etts (p < 0.001). the gardine- and gendine-coated etts were more durable against mrsa than either the silver-coated  or uncoated etts for up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001). we have therefore shown that gardine- and gendine-coated etts are superior to silver-coated etts in preventing biofilm. future animal and clinical studies are warranted to determine whether the gardine- and gendine-coated etts can significantly reduce the risk of vap.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == is selective digestive decontamination useful in controlling aerobic gram-negative bacilli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases?
AB  == aims: to identify outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection due to extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing aerobic gram-negative bacilli (agnb-esbl); to establish whether agnb-esbl, sensitive to tobramycin, become resistant over time; and to evaluate the impact of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (sdd) on abnormal carriage of agnb-esbl. design and setting:  all children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (picu) over a 12-month period had biweekly surveillance cultures of throat and rectum and diagnostic cultures when clinically indicated. all agnb were tested for esbl, and the positive isolates were sent for molecular typing. the picu uses sdd (parenteral cefotaxime and enteral polymyxin e/tobramycin) to control abnormal carriage. patients who had at least one agnb-esbl were included in the study. results: during the study period, 1,101 children were admitted to the picu. there were 39  patients (3.5%) with a total of 236 cultures positive for agnb-esbl. twenty-eight patients (2.5%) were carriers, and 11 (1%) had proven infections. organisms isolated from the first culture were 14 patients with klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 with enterobacter cloacae, 7 with citrobacter freundii, 5 with klebsiella oxytoca, and 5 with escherichia coli. in the first sample, 59% of isolates showed tobramycin resistance. molecular typing confirmed that there were five different  strains of k. pneumoniae and that similar strains were not isolated in the same period. conclusions: sdd is an effective measure to control agnb-esbl and to avoid outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection. when tobramycin resistance is found, replacing it with another aminoglycoside based on antibiogram may be more effective in achieving agnb clearance.

TI  == activity of tigecycline alone and in combination with colistin and meropenem against klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing enterobacteriaceae strains by time-kill assay.
AB  == antibiotic combinations including tigecycline have not been studied against klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing pathogens. tigecycline alone  and combined with colistin and meropenem was tested against eight genetically unrelated kpc-producing clinical strains of enterobacteriaceae (four k. pneumoniae, two escherichia coli, one enterobacter cloacae and one serratia marcescens) by time-kill assay. tigecycline displayed a concentration-independent bacteriostatic activity in seven strains and bactericidal activity in one strain. colistin showed bactericidal activity at 4x the minimum inhibitory concentration  (mic) in three strains and was bacteriostatic for the remaining strains and concentrations. meropenem was bactericidal in three strains and bacteriostatic in five strains. the tigecycline+meropenem combination was not bactericidal against  the four k. pneumoniae strains and was non-synergistic against all eight strains. tigecycline+colistin was bactericidal against all strains at most time intervals  and concentrations and was also synergistic at 1x and 2x mic against most strains up to 4-8h and at 4x mic up to 24 h against all strains. these findings suggest that, at most drug concentrations, tigecycline, colistin and meropenem as single  agents do not exhibit efficient bactericidal activity against most of the kpc-producing strains. tigecycline alone might be a therapeutic option for infections caused by kpc-producers when bacteriostatic activity is adequate or combined with colistin when bactericidal activity is necessary. additional in vivo tests are warranted to assess better the killing kinetics of tigecycline combinations against kpc-producers.

AB  == background: with diminishing antimicrobial potency, the choice of effective empirical therapy has become more challenging. thus, the pharmacodynamic evaluation of potential therapies is essential to identify optimal agents, doses  and administration strategies. methods: monte carlo simulation was conducted for  standard and/or prolonged infusion regimens of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, doripenem, ertapenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. minimum inhibitory concentrations were obtained for escherichia coli (n=64 respiratory isolates), enterobacter cloacae (n=53), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=75) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=273) throughout canada. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) was calculated using bactericidal targets for each regimen against each species. a cfr >/=90% was defined as optimal. results: all cefepime, doripenem, ertapenem and meropenem regimens achieved optimal exposures against enterobacteriaceae, whereas target attainment was organism and dose dependent for the other agents. prolonged infusion doripenem and meropenem 1 g and 2 g every 8 h, along with standard infusion doripenem and meropenem 2 g every 8 h, were the only regimens to attain  optimal exposures against p aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin had the lowest cfr against  p aeruginosa, followed by cefepime. among the p aeruginosa isolates collected in  the intensive care unit (icu) compared with the wards, differences of 0.5% to 10% were noted in favour of non-icu isolates for all agents; however, marked differences (10% to 15%) in cfr were observed for ciprofloxacin in favour of icu  isolates. conclusion: standard dosing of cefepime, doripenem, ertapenem and meropenem has a high likelihood of obtaining optimal pharmacodynamic indexes against these enterobacteriaceae. for p aeruginosa, aggressive treatment with high-dose and/or prolonged infusion regimens are likely required to address the elevated resistance rates of respiratory isolates from canada.

TI  == urinary tract infection caused by carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa.
AB  == there has been an increase in recent years of antimicrobial resistance of gram negative bacilli (gnb). carbapenems, the mainstay for the treatment of multidrug  resistant gnb infections, are no longer always effective leaving treatment options limited. we present the case of patient with recurrent, complicated urinary tract infections. the current episode was caused by carbapenem-resistant  k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa and carbapenem-susceptible, but mdr e. cloacae. resistance to carbapenems of k. pneumoniae was conferred by the production of the class b metallo-beta-lactamase, vim1. infection control measures were implemented and following a 2-week course of treatment with colistin, the infection resolved  and the patient was discharged. we discuss the changes in the epidemiology, the mechanisms involved and the means of detecting carbapenem resistance in gnb. we would also like to stress the role of infection control measures in limiting patient-to-patient spread of mdr organisms which, are of paramount importance in  cases when few treatment options are left available.

TI  == bactericidal oncocin derivatives with superior serum stabilities.
AB  == the proline-rich antimicrobial peptide oncocin is remarkably active in vitro against a number of important gram-negative bacteria of concern to humans owing to their increasing resistance to antibiotics, i.e. enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenting species (acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa). degradation of oncocin in mouse serum was investigated in this study. several approaches to stabilise the main cleavage sites (c-terminal to arg-15 and n-terminal to arg-19) by substituting either or both arginine (arg) residues with non-proteinogenic amino acids, i.e. alpha-amino-3-guanidino-propionic acid, homoarginine, nitro-arginine, n-methyl-arginine, beta-homoarginine, d-arginine (d-arg) or ornithine (orn), were tested. these modifications were found to increase the half-life of oncocin in full mouse serum. for oncocin with two orn residues in positions 15 and 19, the half-life in full serum increased from 25 min to 3 h. an increase of >8 h was observed for oncocin with two d-arg residues  at these same positions. the antibacterial activities of these modified sequences were slightly better than the original oncocin sequence. moreover, the three most stable analogues were found to be bactericidal against e. coli and were not toxic to hela cells or haemolytic to human erythrocytes.

TI  == comparing in vitro activity of tigecycline by using the disk diffusion test, the  manual microdilution method, and the vitek 2 automated system.
AB  == tigecycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic having activity against multiresistant isolates. in vitro susceptibility testing is difficult to perform with the use of traditional microbiological techniques. the aim of this study was to evaluate the disk diffusion test with three different mueller-hinton agar brands, and the vitek 2 automated system in comparison with the standard broth microdilution method against 200 gram-negative isolates (escherichia coil, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and acinetobacter baumannii). among enterobacteriaceae, the becton dickinson agar had the lowest rate of minor (32.5%) and major errors (3.8%). no very major errors were found. for a. baumanni, the rate of minor and major errors was lower. a high rate of agreement (94%) was found between the broth microdilution method and the vitek 2  system. our results show that there are important differences between agars used  for the disk diffusion test, and that vitek 2 is a valid tool for susceptibility  testing in clinical laboratories.

TI  == [occurrence of 16s rrna methylase arma producing enterobacteriaceae in a general  hospital in warsaw, poland].
AB  == resistance to gentamicin, amikacin and kanamycin was screened in 270 clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae originated from april 19 to may 19, 2010 in a regular hospital in warsaw, poland. most of the isolated bacteria were considered pathogenic. nineteen isolates (7%) were simultaneously resistant to two or three  of the tested aminoglycosides. mics of the three aminoglycosides ranged form 128  to 1024 mcg/ml for six isolates. these isolates were suspected to produce 16s rrna methylase. genes encoding for three methylases reported in europe: arma, rmtb and rmtc were searched by pcr. the arma gene was detected in all of the six  isolates. this group encompassed enterobacter cloacae (n=4), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and proteus mirabilis (n=1). five isolates of this group carried the bla(cax-m) gene for ctx-m type esbl. the remaining isolate e. cloacae dm0340  was esbl negative and lacked bla(crx-m) that may suggest an altered genetic environment of the arma gene in this isolate. our results showed that 2.2% of the tested isolates produced 16s rrna methylase arma. this finding may argue for a high incidence of arma producing enterobacteriaceae in poland when compared to reports from other european countries.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections in china: the 2002-2009 study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the distribution and susceptibility of aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli (gnb) isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections (iais) in china. from 2002 to 2009, minimum inhibitory concentrations of 14 antibiotics for 3420 aerobic and facultative gnb from up to eight hospitals in six cities were determined by the broth microdilution method. enterobacteriaceae comprised 82.9% (2834/3420) of the total isolates, with escherichia coli (49.2%) being the most commonly isolated species followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (17.0%), enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and citrobacter freundii (2.3%). amongst the antimicrobial agents tested, the three carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem) were the most active agents against enterobacteriaceae, with susceptibility rates of 96.1-99.6% (2002-2009),  98.2-100% (2002-2009) and 99.6-100% (2002-2004), respectively, followed by amikacin (86.8-95.1%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (84.5-94.3%). susceptibility rates of all tested third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae declined by nearly 30%, with susceptibility rates of 40.2%, 39.1%, 56.3% and 51.8% in 2009 for ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime, respectively. the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased rapidly, especially for e. coli (from 20.8% in 2002 to 64.9% in 2009).  susceptibility of e. coli to ciprofloxacin decreased from 57.6% in 2002 to 24.2%  in 2009. the least active agent against enterobacteriaceae was ampicillin/sulbactam (sam) (25.3-44.3%). in conclusion, enterobacteriaceae were the major pathogens causing iais, and carbapenems retained the highest susceptibility rates over the 8-year study period. third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and sam may not be ideal choices for empirical therapy of iais in china.

TI  == ertapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: risk factors for acquisition and outcomes.
AB  == background and objective: carbapenem resistance among enterobacteriaceae is of concern because of increasing prevalence and limited therapeutic options. limited research has been focused on understanding ertapenem resistance as a more sensitive marker for resistance to other carbapenems. we sought to determine risk factors for acquisition of ertapenem-resistant, meropenem-susceptible, or intermediate enterobacteriaceae and to assess associated patient outcomes. design: retrospective case-control study among adult hospitalized inpatients. setting: a 902-bed quaternary care urban hospital. results: sixty-two cases of ertapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae were identified from march 14, 2006, through october 31, 2007, and 62 unmatched control patients were randomly selected from other inpatients with cultures positive for ertapenem-susceptible enterobacteriaceae. thirty-seven (60%) of case patient isolates were enterobacter cloacae, 20 (32%) were klebsiella pneumoniae, and 5 (8%) were other species of enterobacteriaceae. risk factors for ertapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae infection included intensive care unit stay (odds ratio [or], 4.6 [95% confidence interval {ci}, 2.0-10.3]), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus colonization (or, 7.1 [95% ci, 2.4-21.4]), prior central venous catheter use (or, 10.0 [95% ci, 3.0-33.1]), prior receipt of mechanical ventilation (or, 5.8 [95% ci, 2.1-16.2]), exposure to any antibiotic during the 30 days prior to a positive culture result  (or, 18.5 [95% ci, 4.9-69.9]), use of a beta-lactam during the 30 days prior to a positive culture result (or, 6.9 [95% ci, 3.0-16.0], and use of a carbapenem during the 30 days prior to a positive culture result (or, 18.2 [95% ci, 2.6-130.0]). for the 62 case patients, 30-day outcomes from the time of positive  culture result were 24 discharges (39%), 10 deaths (16%), and 28 continued hospitalizations (44%). the final end point of the hospitalization was discharge  for 44 patients (71%) and death for 18 patients (29%). conclusions: ertapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae are important nosocomial pathogens. multiple mechanisms of resistance may be in operation. additional study of ertapenem resistance is needed.

TI  == vejovine, a new antibiotic from the scorpion venom of vaejovis mexicanus.
AB  == multidrug resistant bacterial infections are one of the most important health problems in recent years. resistance to conventional antibiotics limits the therapeutic options causing increase rate in morbid-mortality in hospitals. therefore, new antibacterial agents with new bacterial targets have been searched and found in many different sources, including scorpion venom and scorpion hemolymph. here, we report a new anti-microbial peptide named vejovine. this peptide was isolated from the venom of the mexican scorpion vaejovis mexicanus by two steps of reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc). it  is composed of 47 amino acid residues with no cysteine residues in its sequence,  with a molecular weight of 4873 da. the chemical synthesis of vejovine was performed by the solid phase method of merrifield, using fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (fmoc)-amino acids. both the native and synthetic peptides were shown to have essentially the same activity. vejovine inhibits growth of clinical isolates of gram-negative multidrug resistant (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumanii) causing nosocomial infections with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 4.4 mum up to 50 mum. this peptide has also hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes with a hc(50) value of 100 mum. a cdna library of the venomous gland of this scorpion provided material for cloning the  gene encoding vejovine. this peptide is a new type of antibiotic, showing less than 50% similarity to other known scorpion peptides. vejovine is a candidate to  be used as a leading compound for future development of an effective peptide against multidrug resistant bacteria.

TI  == sensitization of microcin j25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
AB  == microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella  species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.

TI  == the clinical and prognostic importance of positive blood cultures in adults.
AB  == background: bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults. bloodstream infections should be reassessed periodically because of increased antibiotic resistance, more patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy, improved antiretroviral therapy, and acquisition of infection in health  care settings other than hospitals. methods: we conducted retrospective assessment by infectious disease physicians of hospitalized adults with positive  blood cultures at 3 academic medical centers. results: two thousand two hundred seventy positive blood culture episodes occurred in 1706 patients. of 2669 isolates, 51% represented true infection, 41% contamination, and 8% unknown clinical significance. although coagulase-negative staphylococci were most common, only 10% were clinically significant. among 1225 true bloodstream infections, the most frequent isolates were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens. intravenous catheters were the most common primary source of bloodstream infection (23% of episodes). most (81%) bloodstream infections were acquired in the hospital or other health care settings. crude and attributable in-hospital case-fatality ratios were 20% and 12%, respectively, lower than in previous studies. increasing age, hypotension, absence of fever, hospital acquisition, extreme white blood cell count values, and the presence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malignancy, or renal disease were significantly associated with an increased risk of in-hospital attributable death in multivariable analysis. conclusions: the proportion of bloodstream infections  due to intravenous catheters is continuing to increase. most episodes were acquired in the hospital or other health care setting. in-hospital case-fatality  ratios have decreased compared with previous studies. several previously identified factors associated with an increased mortality remain statistically significant.

AB  == objective: this study aimed to determine whether the variations in the occurrence of gram-negative enteric rods as detected through a longitudinal follow up with three consecutive visits, may be associated with the periodontal clinical status. design: clinical and demographic parameters from 63 untreated chronic periodontitis (cp) subjects and 45 healthy controls (hc) were analyzed. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 6 sites in each subject at baseline, 1-week, and 1-month visits and processed using culture and biochemical  tests. culture findings were categorized taking into account the detection frequency of gram-negative enteric rods as persistent presence, transient presence, or absence of enteric rods in any sampling time. results: although transient presence of gram-negative enteric rods was more prevalent in cp subjects (16.7%) than hc subjects (9.3%), the difference was not significant (p>0.05). the majority of subjects showed a transient presence of gram-negative enteric rods at concentrations <2 x 10(2)cfu/ml. persistent presence of gram-negative enteric rods was not observed in any subject through the entire study period. moreover, differences in both the detection frequencies of individual species and the total number of gram-negative enteric rods were not statistically significant neither inter- nor intragroups. conclusion: the findings of the present study could indicate that gram-negative enteric rods are  merely transient microorganisms within the subgingival environment and suggest that the periodontal clinical status appeared not to be influenced by the presence of these species.

TI  == influence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance on adult in-hospital mortality from post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
AB  == background/purpose: to investigate the clinical features, etiology and predictors of in-hospital mortality in adults with post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.  methods: this retrospective analysis included 60 adult patients with culture-proven post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis hospitalized between september 2006 and august 2008. results: of the 60 patients, 88.3% had monomicrobial infection and 11.7% had mixed infection. the mean duration from the first neurosurgical procedure to the diagnosis of meningitis was 21 days (range,  1-134 days). the median frequency of neurosurgical procedure before meningitis was 1 (range, 1-5). a total of 69 isolates were identified from the cerebrospinal fluid, the most common pathogens were gram-negative bacilli (43, 62.3%), followed by gram-positive bacteria (24, 34.8%). the three most common gram-negative bacilli were serratia marcescens (7, 10.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.7%), and enterobacter cloacae (4, 5.8%). pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii isolates comprised less than 3%. notably, glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli other than acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp. accounted for 11.6% of the total. of the gram-negative bacilli, resistance rates to the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, were 58.1% and 34.9%, respectively. the two most common gram-positive pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (10, 14.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (including s. epidermidis) (10, 14.5%). the in-hospital mortality rate was 15.0%, which was  significantly related to gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 33.65; p = 0.047). conclusion: these findings may portend the spread of serious resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in nosocomial gram-negative bacilli throughout the neurosurgical units, suggestive of the need to reassess the empirical use of  third-generation cephalosporins in post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.

TI  == [dynamics of acquires resistance in the main gramnegative pathogens of surgical infections to beta-lactams in 2004-2008].
AB  == resistance of 2134 clinical isolates of etiologically significant species of gramnegative bacteria to 5 beta-lactam antibiotics, i. e. cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and ceftazidime (the 3rd generation cephalosporin) as the reference drug was investigated for the period of 5 years (2004-2008). in total, 554 strains of e. coli, 578 strains of p. aeruginosa, 255 strains of acinetobacter spp., 161 strains of proteus mirabilis, 359 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 227 strains of enterobacter cloacae were assayed in dynamics. the comparative analysis of the frequency of the antibiotic resistant isolates from the patients treated within 2004-2008 with often and long-term use of cefoperazom-sulbactam, meropenem and imipenem revealed an increase in development of resistance to all beta-lactams, including the inhibitor-protected ones. it least of all concerned imipenem, still isolation of  39.5% of the imipenem resistant strains of p. aeruginosa was in favour of the tendency. a dramatic 3-5-fold rise of resistance in 2007 and 2008 in the isolates of k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and acinetobacter spp. to both the inhibitor-protected beta-lactams, that averaged 56 and 45%, 45 and 35% and 26 and 30% respectively, deserved attention. it was assumed that the main mechanism of resistance in the isolates to the inhibitor-protected beta-lactams was hyperproduction of beta-lactamase of type ctx-m. the large part of the cefepime resistant isolates of k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter spp. (76.8 and 62.2% respectively) was in favour of the assumption. it was concluded that periodical reversion of the policy of preventive antibiotic prophylaxis was necessary, since such a prophylaxis is a reliable barrier to development of postoperative complications and at the same time it promotes selection of nosocomial strains with some other mechanisms of antibiotic resistance under hospital conditions.

AB  == during january-june 2010, three enterobacteriaceae isolates carrying a newly described resistance mechanism, the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm-1), were identified from three u.s. states at the cdc antimicrobial susceptibility laboratory. this is the first report of ndm-1 in the united states, and the first report of metallo-beta-lactamase carriage among enterobacteriaceae in the united  states. these isolates, which include an escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae, carry blandm-1, which confers resistance to all beta-lactam agents except aztreonam (a monobactam antimicrobial); all three isolates were aztreonam resistant, presumably by a different mechanism. in the united kingdom, where these organisms are increasingly common, carriage of enterobacteriaceae containing blandm-1 has been closely linked to receipt of medical care in india and pakistan. all three u.s. isolates were from patients who received recent medical care in india.

TI  == antibacterial properties of tualang honey and its effect in burn wound management: a comparative study.
AB  == background: the use of honey as a natural product of apis spp. for burn treatment has been widely applied for centuries. tualang honey has been reported to have antibacterial properties against various microorganisms, including those from burn-related diagnoses, and is cheaper and easier to be absorbed by aquacel dressing. the aim of this study is to evaluate the potential antibacterial properties of tualang honey dressing and to determine its effectiveness as a partial thickness burn wound dressing. methods: in order to quantitate the bioburden of the swabs, pour plates were performed to obtain the colony count (cfu/ml). swabs obtained from burn wounds were streaked on blood agar and macconkey agar for bacterial isolation and identification. later, antibacterial activity of aquacel-tualang honey, aquacel-manuka honey, aquacel-ag and aquacel-  plain dressings against bacteria isolated from patients were tested (in-vitro) to see the effectiveness of those dressings by zone of inhibition assays. results: seven organisms were isolated. four types of gram-negative bacteria, namely enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp., and three gram-positive bacteria, namely staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus aureus (cons) and streptococcus spp., were isolated. total bacterial count decreased on day 6 and onwards. in the in-vitro antibacterial study, aquacel-ag and aquacel-manuka honey dressings gave better zone of inhibition for gram positive bacteria compared to aquacel-tualang honey dressing. however, comparable results were obtained against gram negative bacteria tested with aquacel-manuka honey and aquacel-tualang honey dressing. conclusions: tualang honey has a bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic effect. it is useful as a dressing, as it is easier to apply and is less sticky compared  to manuka honey. however, for gram positive bacteria, tualang honey is not as effective as usual care products such as silver-based dressing or medical grade honey dressing.

TI  == the association between antibiotic use and resistance: the role of secondary antibiotics.
AB  == using susceptibility rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae over time as markers, we assessed the significance of the change of susceptibility rates to imipenem, ceftriaxone,  cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin over time and the relationship to antibiotic use for the period 2000-2006. antibiotic use-susceptibility relationships were assessed using longitudinal regression analysis. the variables "time" and define daily doses (ddd)/1,000 patient days for the specific drug related to the susceptibility rates of that particular model's dependent variable were considered as the main effects, with significance determined at the 0.05 level. decreases in susceptibility of the target organisms were common over the period of observation. decreasing susceptibility trends over time were not statistically associated with the primary drug (e.g., organism susceptibility rate to imipenem with imipenem usage). however, secondary drug use was associated with susceptibility rates (e.g., susceptibility of e. cloacae to cefepime with piperacillin/tazobactam usage). these results suggest that antibiotic use-resistance relationships are influenced by the use of secondary antibiotics. thus, a resistance problem may not be adequately addressed by simply altering the utilization of the primary antibiotic.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection in gram-negative bacilli of nosocomial origin.
AB  == background: resistance to third generation cephalosporins by acquisition and expression of extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) enzymes among gram-negative bacilli is on a rise. the presence of esbl producing organisms significantly affects the course and outcome of an infection and poses a challenge to infection management worldwide. materials and methods: in the period from june 2007 to 2008, we collected 1489 samples from patients suspected of nosocomial infection.  the isolates were identified based on colony morphology and biochemical reaction. gram negative bacilli resistant to third generation cephalosporins were tested for esbl by double disc synergy test (ddst- a screening test)and then phenotypic  confirmatory test. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by modified kirby bauer disc diffusion method. results: from the sample of 238 gram-negative  bacilli, we isolated escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii and enterobacter cloacae. following both methods, 34% isolates were esbl-positive. the esbl producing isolates were significantly resistant (p < 0.01) to ampicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin as compared to non-esbl producers. multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (69.14%) in esbl positive isolates than non-esbl isolates (21.66%). conclusion: high prevalence of esbl in our hospital cannot be ignored. esbl producers can be detected by ddst and phenotypic confirmatory test with equal efficacy. the sensitivity of screening test improved with the use of more than one antibiotic and addition of  one or two antibiotics would not increase cost and labor. we recommend ddst using multiple antibiotics in all microbiology units as a routine screening test.

TI  == comparison of the efficacy of rose bengal and erythrosin in photodynamic therapy  against enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the photosensitizers rose bengal and erythrosin combined with a light-emitting diode (led) on enterobacteriaceae. twelve enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from the oral cavities of patients undergoing prolonged antibiotic therapy, including three escherichia coli, three enterobacter cloacae, three klebsiella oxytoca and three  klebsiella pneumoniae, were studied. an enterobacteriaceae suspension (10(6) cells/ml) was prepared from each clinical strain isolated from the human oral cavity and subjected to the following treatments: led and rose bengal, led and erythrosin, led and physiological solution, and physiological solution only as control. a blue led unit (460 nm), and rose bengal and erythrosin at a concentration of 50 micromol/l were used. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 h, the number of colony-forming units (cfu) was calculated and subjected to analysis of variance (anova). the enterobacterial strains were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with rose bengal. there was a reduction of approximately 7.14 log10 for enterobacter cloacae, 7.73 log10 for escherichia coli, 6.76 log10  for klebsiella pneumoniae and 7.21 log10 for klebsiella oxytoca. however, photodynamic therapy using erythrosin did not reduce the numbers of cfus per milliliter compared to the control group. the use of the led alone had no toxic effect on the strain tested. the enterobacteriaceae strains studied were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with rose bengal.

TI  == efflux pumps are involved in the defense of gram-negative bacteria against the natural products isobavachalcone and diospyrone.
AB  == the activities of two naturally occurring compounds, isobavachalcone and diospyrone, against documented strains and multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacterial isolates were evaluated. the results indicated that the two compounds exhibited intrinsic antibacterial activity against several gram-negative bacteria, and their activities were significantly improved in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor (mic values decreased to below 10 microg/ml). in addition, the activities of isobavachalcone and diospyrone against various strains exhibiting deletions of the major efflux pump components (acrab,  tolc) were significantly increased. the overall results indicate that isobavachalcone and diospyrone could be candidates for the development of new drugs against mdr strains and that their use in combination with efflux pump inhibitors reinforces their activity.

TI  == colistin administration to pediatric and neonatal patients.
AB  == emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative nosocomial pathogens has led to resurgence of colistin use. safety and efficacy data regarding colistin use in pediatric patients are sparse, while optimal dosage has not been defined. we present a case series of neonates and children without cystic fibrosis treated with various doses of colistin intravenously. the records of patients who received colistin in a tertiary-care hospital from january 2007 to march 2009 were reviewed. thirteen patients (median age 5 years, range 22 days to 14 years)  received 19 courses of colistin as treatment of pneumonia, central nervous system infection, bacteremia, or complicated soft tissue infection. the isolated pathogens were acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. daily dose  of colistin (colistimethate) ranged between 40,000 and 225,000 iu/kg. duration of administration ranged from 1 to 133 days. other antimicrobials were co-administered in 18/19 courses. increase of serum creatinine in one patient was associated with co-administration of colistin and gentamicin. sixteen of 19 courses had a favorable outcome, and only two of the three deaths were infection-related. colistin intravenous administration appears well tolerated even at higher than previously recommended doses and of prolonged duration.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == colistin therapy for microbiologically documented multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections: a retrospective cohort study of 258 patients.
AB  == it is unclear whether the effectiveness of polymyxins depends on the site of infection, the responsible pathogen, dosage, and monotherapy vs. combination therapy. we investigated colistin therapy in a large, retrospective, single-centre, cohort study. primary analysis outcomes were infection outcome, survival and nephrotoxicity. over a 7-year period (october 2000 to october 2007), 258 patients received intravenous (i.v.) colistin for at least 72h for microbiologically documented multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections, comprising 170 (65.9%) acinetobacter baumannii, 68 (26.4%) pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 (7.0%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 (0.4%) stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 1 (0.4%) enterobacter cloacae. cure of infection occurred in 79.1% of patients, nephrotoxicity in 10% and hospital survival in 65.1%. in the multivariate analysis, independent predictors of survival were colistin average daily dose [adjusted odds ratio (aor)=1.22, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.05-1.42] and cure of infection (aor=9, 95% ci 3.6-23.1), whilst the proportion of creatinine change (aor=0.21, 95% ci 0.1-0.45), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii score (aor=0.89, 95% ci 0.84-0.95) and  haematological disease (aor=0.23, 95% ci 0.08-0.66) were associated with mortality. effectiveness of colistin was not dependent on the type of pathogen. no independent predictors for nephrotoxicity were observed. the findings of the largest cohort study to date on i.v. colistin show that colistin is a valuable antibiotic with acceptable nephrotoxicity and considerable effectiveness that depends on the daily dosage and infection site.

AB  == staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and more bacteria have  shown resistance to antibiotics in colombia, therefore, resistance to antibiotics is a problem that is on increase in colombia. the resistance mechanism to penicillin antibiotics in these bacteria is the expression of beta-lactamase enzyme. in order to use the penicillin antibiotics which are still effective against them, we had evaluated 10 chalcones as inhibitors of this enzyme. the most active chalcone showed k(m') = 406.7 microm higher than clavulanic acid that showed k(m') = 211.9 microm at 37 degrees c during 10 h, and using amoxycillin as substrate. the chalcones were better competitive inhibitors because of they allowed the hydrolysis of smaller quantity of amoxycillin than the clavulanic acid, the most active chalcone showed k(cat)/k(m) = 1.398 (minm)(-1) and the clavulanic acid showed k(cat)/k(m) = 2.674 (minm)(-1). the molecular modelling of the enzyme-chalcones complexes showed that the chalcones with electron-donating groups on ortho, meta position of a ring favour the interaction with the residues threonine-319, lysine-67, serine-64 and tyrosine-150 of the active site of the enzyme, because of the number and strong of hydrogen bonds of the chalcones in the active site of the enzyme increase, and therefore the affinity of the chalcones increases too. the electron-donating groups in the chalcones contribute to their inductive effect improving the interaction with the active site of the enzyme because of rising of electrostatic attraction between them.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in brazil.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. in this study, 127 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at sao paulo, brazil, were submitted to analysis by pcr  with specific primers for bla shv, bla tem and bla ctx-m genes. from the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%)  morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) enterobacter cloacae were identified as esbl producers. bla shv, bla tem and bla ctx-m were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of k. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. pcr results showed a high variety of esbl groups among strains, in nine different species. the results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.

TI  == [epidemiology of enterobacteriaceae causing bloodstream infections in neonatal intensive care unit patients].
AB  == introduction: an increasing number of neonates require intensive care, and this population has a high risk of developing infections. the enterobacteriaceae most  commonly related to healthcare-associated infection in neonatal intensive care units (nicu) are escherichia coli, klebsiella spp and enterobacter cloacae. methods: from january 2001 to december 2005, 84 bloodstream infections caused by  e. cloacae, e. coli and klebsiella spp. were studied in 80 neonates hospitalized  in the nicu and intermediate care unit. clinical histories were reviewed to extract the most important demographic data. identification and susceptibility patterns were carried out with gn vitek 2 and ast_n057 vitek 2 (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). molecular typing was performed by macrorestriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: twenty-one community bloodstream infections and 63 healthcare-associated infections were diagnosed. in community bloodstream infections there were no significant differences according  to birth weight or gestational age of the neonates. in healthcare-associated infection, however, there was a high percentage of neonates whose birth weight was between 1.001 and 1.500 grams and gestational age < or =36 weeks (p<0.001). on pfge analysis, the majority of e. coli strains belonged to different clones. among klebsiella pneumoniae and e. cloacae isolates, some strains showed a high percentage of similarity, highlighting detection of an e. cloacae outbreak. conclusion: the study has provided better knowledge of bloodstream infections caused by enterobacteriaceae in the nicu of our hospital from both the epidemiological and clonal standpoints.

AB  == a clinical klebsiella pneumoniae isolate carrying the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene variants bla(shv-40), bla(tem-116) and bla(ges-7) was recovered. cefoxitin and ceftazidime activity was most affected by the presence of these genes and an additional resistance to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was observed. the bla(ges-7) gene was found to be inserted into a class 1 integron. these results show the emergence of novel bla(tem) and bla(shv) genes in brazil.  moreover, the presence of class 1 integrons suggests a great potential for dissemination of bla(ges) genes into diverse nosocomial pathogens. indeed, the bla(ges-7) gene was originally discovered in enterobacter cloacae in greece and,  to our knowledge, has not been reported elsewhere.

TI  == phenotypic characterization of human pathogenic bacteria in fish from the coastal waters of south west cameroon: public health implications.
AB  == increasing economic and recreational opportunities, attractive scenery and a perception of a better quality of life are luring people to the coast. unfortunately, these activities together with the commensurate increase in population in the area inevitably result in pollution of coastal waters with excessive microorganisms and other pollutants. microbial pollutants not only contaminate the coastal water but also aquatic food sources, thus posing a health risk to consumers. fish is a major source of protein in cameroon, especially in the coastal areas. in this study, we investigated the microbiological quality of  fish from the limbe and tiko beaches in south west cameroon from may to october 2007. we isolated human pathogenic bacteria from three anatomic sites (skin, gills, intestine) of 50 fish (150 specimens) and investigated their susceptibility patterns to a battery of antibiotics. data were analyzed statistically using chi2 with significance set at p < .05. eleven bacterial species were identified, including escherichia coli type 1 (20.8%), citrobacter fruendii (16.4%), proteus vulgaris (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), klebsiella ozaenae (7.7%), enterobacter cloacae (7.2%), klebsiella oxytoca (5.8%), serratia marcescens (4.8%), serratia odorifera (4.8%), hafnia alvei (4.4%) and proteus penneri (2.9%). more contaminated fish were found at limbe beach than at tiko beach (61.4% versus 38.6%, respectively (p < .05)). when ranking contamination with respect to anatomic site, skin was the most contaminated (40.6%) specimen and gills the least (28.5%). ciprofloxacillin, ofloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole were the most effective antibiotics against all isolates, exhibiting 100% sensitivity. almost half of the isolates (45.7%) were resistant to ampicillin. the results of our study demonstrate that fish from the  coastal waters of south west cameroon are a source of human pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria; hence this finding has public health implications.

TI  == molecular identification of coliform bacteria from colicky breastfed infants.
AB  == objective: to determine the presence of intestinal coliform bacteria in colicky vs healthy infants. study design: we isolated coliform strains from faeces and performed quantitative bacterial cultures in 41 colicky and 39 healthy breastfed  infants, identified using pcr with species-specific primers, strain-specific automated ribotyping and the api-50e kit for enterobacteriaceae to identify the most frequent strains. results: coliform strains were more abundant in colicky infants (median 6.04 log(10) cfu/g faeces, range 2.00-8.76) vs controls (median 4.47 log(10) cfu/g faeces, range 1.00-8.08) (p = 0.026). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes and enterococcus faecalis were the predominant species in colicky and healthy infants. the counts of each bacterial species differed between the two groups, and the difference was significant (p = 0.002) for e. coli: median 6.30 log(10) cfu/g faeces (range 3.00-8.74) in colicky infants, and median 4.70 log(10) cfu/g  faeces (range 2.00-5.85) in controls. conclusions: this is the first study to evaluate the colonization patterns of gas-forming coliforms in colicky infants and healthy controls identified by molecular methods. coliform bacteria, particularly escherichia coli, were found to be more abundant in colicky infants. our data could help to shed light on the cause of infantile colic.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == prevalence of qnr determinants among extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in southern stockholm, sweden.
AB  == three hundred and nineteen extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were screened for qnr genes. twelve isolates were positive for qnr, including one qnra1, two qnrb1, three qnrb2, one qnrb4, one qnrb6 and four qnrs1. no qnr-positive strains were identified among the isolates recovered before 2006. the first qnr-positive escherichia coli was detected from a patient in 2006. qnr genes remained rare in e. coli (6/288; 2.1%), but appeared to be more prevalent in klebsiella pneumoniae (4/25; 16%) and enterobacter cloacae (2/3; 66.7%). all qnr-positive isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid while presenting varied susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones. isolates harbouring qnrb4 or qnrb6 were highly resistant to all the fluoroquinolones tested. their high-level resistance is associated with multiple  chromosomal substitutions in gyra and parc. alterations at codons ser-83 and asp-87 in gyra and at codons ser-80 and glu-84 in parc were observed in these isolates.

TI  == can we rely on one laboratory test in detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae? an evaluation of the vitek 2 system and comparison with four other detection methods in kuwait.
AB  == background and aims: clinical hospitals need to correctly identify extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria in infected patients to correctly treat the patient and avoid spreading antibiotic resistance. kuwaiti hospitals use one laboratory test for detecting esbl bacteria. this study evaluated whether that was sufficient to detect esbl bacteria, and compared the vitek system with other detection systems. methods: (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, k oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae) were collected from five different kuwaiti main hospitals, all of which were flagged as esbl-positive by the vitek 2 system. the isolates were retested by the vitek 2 system, and were also tested by double disc diffusion (ddd), the disc approximation test, the e-test and the microscan system for the detection of esbls. results: retesting with the vitek system revealed 100% compatibility with the results of the source  hospitals. the microscan system, ddd, disc approximation test and e-test could detect esbl in 199, 192, 178 and 205 isolates, respectively. conclusions: technically, the microscan and vitek 2 systems were the least demanding method to detect esbl as it is an integral part of the routine susceptibility test card. e-test strips were reliable but the most expensive of all techniques used. the ddd test and disc approximation, while relatively inexpensive, were technically subjective. the vitek system may be very suitable in clinical laboratories, but would be better if accompanied with another test for detection of esbl bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline alone and in combination against clinical isolates of resistant gram-negative pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == ceftaroline is a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin that exhibits bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and -negative pathogens. however, the activity of ceftaroline cannot be solely relied upon for eradication of multidrug-resistant gram-negative isolates, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae, which represent a current clinical concern. as drug combinations might be beneficial by potential synergy, we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline combined with meropenem, aztreonam, cefepime, tazobactam, amikacin, levofloxacin, and tigecycline. susceptibility testing was performed for 20 clinical p. aeruginosa isolates, 10 esbl-producing escherichia coli isolates, 10 esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, and 10 ampc-derepressed enterobacter cloacae isolates. time-kill experiments were performed for 10 isolates using antimicrobials at one-fourth the mic. ceftaroline exhibited a mic range of 0.125  to 1,024 microg/ml and was reduced 2- to 512-fold by combination with tazobactam  (4 microg/ml) for esbl-producing strains. in time-kill experiments, ceftaroline plus amikacin was synergistic against 90% of the isolates (and indifferent for one p. aeruginosa isolate). ceftaroline plus tazobactam was indifferent for e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa strains but synergistic against 100% of e. coli and k.  pneumoniae isolates. combinations of ceftaroline plus meropenem or aztreonam were also synergistic for all e. coli and e. cloacae isolates, respectively, but indifferent against 90% of the other isolates. finally, combinations of ceftaroline plus either tigecycline, levofloxacin, or cefepime were indifferent for 100% of the isolates. no antagonism was observed with any combination. ceftaroline plus amikacin appeared as the most likely synergistic combination. this represents a promising therapeutic option, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the clinical value of ceftaroline combinations against resistant gram-negative pathogens.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to undertake a survey of the occurrence of  ctx-m and shv extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genotypes in enterobacteriaceae from hunan province, china. methods: clinical isolates (425) from three major hospitals in changsha, hunan province, were collected between october 2004 and july 2005, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities of the genotype of bla(ctx-m) and bla(shv) were determined. random amplified polymorphic dna was used to characterize the clonality of all of the isolates. results: the overall rate of esbl-positive isolates was 33.4% (142/425). the dominant esbls were ctx-m types, and were found in 109/142 (76.8%) isolates comprising seven different genera/species, namely escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris and providencia stuartii. the most common bla(ctx-m) genotypes were bla(ctx-m-14) (47.7%), bla(ctx-m-3) (29.4%) and bla(ctx-m-15) (17.4%). a novel gene derived from bla(ctx-m-15), bla(ctx-m-82) (ala-40-->pro), was identified. conclusions: the dominant esbl genotype in hunan province was bla(ctx-m). the high prevalence (17.4%) of bla(ctx-m-15) has not previously been reported from china. our results identify that an epidemic of bla(ctx-m) in changsha, hunan province, has evolved with the appearance and spread of bla(ctx-m-15) against the dominant genotypes bla(ctx-m-14) and bla(ctx-m-3.) the worldwide dominance of bla(ctx-m-15) could be poised to spread to china, displacing the current prevailing genotypes.

TI  == identification of novel antibacterial peptides by chemoinformatics and machine learning.
AB  == the rise of antibiotic resistant pathogens is one of the most pressing global health issues. discovery of new classes of antibiotics has not kept pace; new agents often suffer from cross-resistance to existing agents of similar structure. short, cationic peptides with antimicrobial activity are essential to  the host defenses of many organisms and represent a promising new class of antimicrobials. this paper reports the successful in silico screening for potent  antibiotic peptides using a combination of qsar and machine learning techniques.  on the basis of initial high-throughput measurements of activity of over 1400 random peptides, artificial neural network models were built using qsar descriptors and subsequently used to screen an in silico library of approximately 100,000 peptides. in vitro validation of the modeling showed 94% accuracy in identifying highly active peptides. the best peptides identified through screening were found to have activities comparable or superior to those of four conventional antibiotics and superior to the peptide most advanced in clinical development against a broad array of multiresistant human pathogens.

TI  == doripenem activity tested against a global collection of enterobacteriaceae, including isolates resistant to other extended-spectrum agents.
AB  == the emergence and rapid dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates among enterobacteriaceae coupled with increasing prevalence of stably derepressed and plasmid-borne ampc producers have rendered broad-spectrum cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations less effective. this scenario has required the use of carbapenems for treatment of infections caused by such organisms. in this study, the in vitro activities of doripenem and comparator agents against enterobacteriaceae, including esbl- and ampc-producing strains, were evaluated. a total of 36 614 isolates collected from more than 60 medical centers (2000-2007) were included and tested for susceptibility using reference methods and interpretive criteria,  except for doripenem (product package insert). overall, doripenem inhibited 98.7% of all enterobacteriaceae tested at <or=0.5 microg/ml. esbl rates were higher among klebsiella pneumoniae (from 7.7% to 44.0%, varied by geographic region), followed by escherichia coli (3.6-14.0%) and proteus mirabilis (0.8-34.8%). derepressed ampc production-mediated resistance rates were highest among enterobacter cloacae (26.6-38.7%) compared with other species and generally higher for strains isolated in the asia-pacific and latin american regions. doripenem inhibited 94.3% and 93.7% of the esbl phenotype and derepressed ampc isolates, respectively, and these resistances had little adverse influence on doripenem mic(50) values (nil to 2-fold increases). the observed increase in ampc- and esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae necessitates a greater confidence on  carbapenem empiric therapy. doripenem could represent a valuable choice for broad-spectrum coverage of contemporary enterobacteriaceae isolates with widespread resistance mechanisms.

TI  == molecular mechanisms disrupting porin expression in ertapenem-resistant klebsiella and enterobacter spp. clinical isolates from the uk.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate relatedness and molecular mechanism(s) of ertapenem resistance in clinical isolates of klebsiella spp. (n = 28) and enterobacter spp. (n = 27) referred from multiple hospitals to the uk national reference laboratory. methods: investigations included genotyping by pfge, resistance gene analysis by pcr and antimicrobial susceptibility testing with and without inhibitors of efflux and beta-lactamase activity. outer membrane proteins (omps) were profiled by sds-page; porin genes were sequenced and their expression was examined by rt-pcr. the contribution of porin deficiency to resistance was investigated by restoring functional porin genes on plasmids. results: pfge showed significant clonal diversity among ertapenem-resistant isolates, with only small clusters identified. shv- and ctx-m-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were identified in the klebsiella spp. isolates, whereas ampc overexpression or kpc carbapenemase was detected in the enterobacter cloacae isolates. sds-page showed that klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes with high-level ertapenem resistance (mics > or = 16 mg/l) consistently lacked both of the two major non-specific porins, whereas variable patterns of ompc and ompf were seen in e. cloacae with lower-level ertapenem resistance. various point mutations or insertion sequences were identified as disrupting the porin-coding sequences, as well as mutations in the promoter region. functional restoration of ompk35 or ompk36 in klebsiella and ompc or ompf in enterobacter spp. isolates significantly decreased the mics of all carbapenems, but particularly of ertapenem. we found no evidence of efflux contributing to resistance. conclusions: ertapenem resistance was exclusively due to combinations of beta-lactamases with impermeability caused by loss of omps. efflux was not implicated and there was no national spread of resistant clones.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamases.
AB  == summary: ampc beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. in many bacteria, ampc enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy.  transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for ampc enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(ampc) gene, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. resistance due to plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. ampc enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. techniques to identify ampc beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates  this resistance mechanism. carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to ampc-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance  efflux (efflux pump activation).

TI  == [bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == objective: bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. the objective of this study was to explore application of the combined  detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. methods: totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. the age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by  streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. the aspirate samples were also amplified for dna of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (tem-pcr) and detected with luminex xmap technology platform. results: the total positive rate  by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were hemophilus  influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella  pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187)  were acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. the total positive rate by combined detection of culture and tem-pcr assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. conclusion: the tem-pcr assay may increase the detection rate of hemophilus influenzae b, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. the tem-pcr needs further improvement for diagnosis of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == etiology of neonatal blood stream infections in tbilisi, republic of georgia.
AB  == background: neonatal blood stream infections (bsi) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. it is crucial to continuously monitor the  local epidemiology of neonatal bsi to detect any changes in patterns of infection and susceptibility to various antibiotics. objectives: to examine the etiology of bsi in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus) in the republic of georgia, a resource-poor country, and to determine antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated organisms. methods: a cross-sectional study of all septic infants was conducted in the nicus of two pediatric hospitals in tbilisi between september 2003 and september 2004. results: a total of 200 infants with clinical signs of sepsis were admitted to two nicus. of these, 126 (63%) had confirmed bacteremia. the mortality rate was 34%. a total of 98 (78%) of 126 recovered isolates were gram-negative organisms and 28 (22%) were gram-positive. klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common pathogen, accounting for 36 (29%) of 126 isolates, followed by enterobacter cloacae accounting for 19 (15%) and staphylococcus aureus accounting for 15 (12%). the gram-negative organisms showed a high degree of resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, and comparatively low resistance to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, carbapenems, and gentamicin; 40% of s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant (mrsa). in multivariate analysis only umbilical discharge was a significant risk factor for having a positive blood culture at admission to nicu (prevalence ratio = 2.25, 95% confidence interval 1.82-2.77). conclusions: neonatal bsi was mainly caused by gram-negative organisms, which are developing resistance to commonly used antibiotics. understanding the local epidemiology of  neonatal bsi can lead to the development of better medical practices, especially  more appropriate choices for empiric antibiotic therapy, and may contribute to improvement of infection control practices.

TI  == transfer of antibiotic multiresistant plasmid rp4 from escherichia coli to activated sludge bacteria.
AB  == in situ transfer of a self-transmissible, antibiotic-multiresistant plasmid rp4 from a laboratory escherichia coli strain c600 to indigenous activated sludge bacteria was investigated using filter mating. the transfer frequency of rp4 from the donor e. coli to the bacteria that was sampled from two wastewater treatment  plants was 5.1x10(-2) to 7.5x10(-1) and 4.6x10(-3) to 1.3x10(-2)/potential recipient. the isolated transconjugants showed resistance to ap, km, and tc and the presence of a plasmid with a similar size to rp4. the trag gene on rp4 was also detected from all transconjugants. reverse-transfer experiments from the transconjugants to e. coli hb101 indicated that rp4 maintained self-transmissibility in the transconjugants. the transconjugant strains were dominant bacteria in activated sludge including pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida, and ochrobactrum anthropi and minor populations of enteric bacterial strains including citrobacter freundii, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, e. asburiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. the transconjugant strains k. pneumoniae ssp. pneumonia, e. cloacae, and e. asburiae had several naturally occurring plasmids. these results suggest that in situ transfer of plasmids and the exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes can occur between released and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge.

AB  == quinolone resistance is an emerging problem in china. to investigate the prevalence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr, a total of 265 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter cloacae with ciprofloxacin mics of > or =0.25 microg/ml were screened at nine teaching hospitals in china. the qnra, qnrb, qnrs, and aac(6')-ib genes were detected by pcr. the aac(6')-ib-cr gene was further identified by digestion with btsci and/or direct sequencing. the qnr gene was present in significantly smaller numbers of isolates with cefotaxime mics of <2 microg/ml than isolates with higher mics (> or =2.0 microg/ml) (20.6% and 42.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). aac(6')-ib-cr was present in 17.0% of the isolates tested, and 7.9% of the isolates carried both the qnr and the aac(6')-ib-cr genes. among the isolates with cefotaxime mics of > or =2.0 microg/ml, qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr were present in 65.7% and 8.6% of e. cloacae isolates, respectively; 65.5% and 21.8% of k. pneumoniae isolates, respectively;  63.3% and 26.7% of c. freundii isolates, respectively; and 6.5% and 16.9% of e. coli isolates, respectively. the 20 transconjugants showed 16- to 128-fold increases in ciprofloxacin mics, 14 showed 16- to 2,000-fold increases in cefotaxime mics, and 5 showed 8- to 32-fold increases in cefoxitin mics relative  to those of the recipient due to the cotransmission of bla(ctx-m-14), bla(ctx-m-3), bla(dha-1), bla(shv-2), and bla(shv-12) with the qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr genes. southern hybridization analysis showed that these genes were located on large plasmids of different sizes (53 to 193 kb). these findings indicate the high prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-ib-cr in members of the family enterobacteriaceae and the widespread dissemination of multidrug resistance in china.

TI  == sitafloxacin hydrate for bacterial infections.
AB  == sitafloxacin hydrate (du-6859a, gracevit), a new-generation, broad-spectrum oral  fluoroquinolone that is very active against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic clinical isolates, including strains resistant to other fluoroquinolones, was recently approved in japan for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections. sitafloxacin is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and other quinolones and enterococci. sitafloxacin has also demonstrated activity against clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (including about 67% of strains producing extended-spectrum, beta-lactamases and resistant to ciprofloxacin), enterobacter  cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa with some activity against quinolone-resistant strains and acinetobacter baumannii. the in vitro activity against anaerobes is comparable to imipenem or metronidazole. in a published phase ii randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, sitafloxacin (400 mg once daily) was comparable to imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg three times a day). results of the phase iii trials of sitafloxacin are not available in english. the clinical safety profile of sitafloxacin has been characterized from 1,059 patients who participated in 10 clinical trials. the most common events with 50 or 100 mg twice daily were gastrointestinal disorders  (17.2%), mostly diarrhea, and abnormal laboratory test results (16.2%), mostly liver enzyme elevations. for japanese patients, sitafloxacin provides the broad-spectrum coverage promised by clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin and comparable to carbapenems. while it is currently limited by its potential for phototoxicity in caucasians, phototoxicity is essentially irrelevant if sitafloxacin is used in hospitals and especially in intensive care units.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == background and purpose: strains of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae have spread widely in taiwan hospitals. in this study, we evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and enterobacter cloacae. methods: 104 confirmed esbl-producing bacteria were isolated from 4 hospitals in mid- and southern taiwan between 2000 and 2006. the in vitro activity of tigecycline against these  esbl producers was tested by use of etest strips. results: the minimal tigecycline concentration at which 50% of isolates were inhibited and minimal concentration at which 90% of isolates were inhibited for esbl-producing isolates ranged from 0.38 to 0.75 microg/ml and 0.5 to 1.5 microg/ml, respectively. conclusions: tigecycline, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, may be considered an alternative drug of choice for patients infected with esbl-producing bacteria.

TI  == the n-terminal domain of nifa determines the temperature sensitivity of nifa in klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == the nifa protein is the central regulator of the nitrogen fixation genes. it activates transcription of nif genes by an alternative holoenzyme form of rna polymerase containing the sigma(54) factor. the nifa protein from klebsiella pneumoniae consists of the n-terminal domain of unknown function, the central catalytic domain with atpase activity and the c-terminal dna-binding domain. the  kp nifa protein is sensitive to temperature, while the enterobacter cloacae nifa  protein is less sensitive to temperature than kp nifa. our results show that the  n-terminal domain of nifa plays the decisive role in the temperature sensitivity  of the protein.

TI  == susceptibility of common aerobic pathogens to tigecycline: results of a surveillance study in germany.
AB  == tigecycline is a novel antimicrobial agent for parenteral use encompassing a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens, including multi-resistant organisms. here, we report the results of the first nationwide surveillance trial that was conducted in order to evaluate the susceptibility of bacterial isolates to tigecycline in a european country prior to its clinical use. a total of 2,610 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms recovered from hospitalized patients were tested. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the microdilution method. all enterococci, staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; mrsa), and streptococci tested were  tigecycline-susceptible, except one isolate of staphylococcus haemolyticus. among the gram-negative bacteria, 100% of the escherichia coli isolates (including extended spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl]-producers) were tigecycline-susceptible,  while about 10% of the enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were resistant. based on the results of this surveillance study, tigecycline may  represent a suitable option most notably for the empiric treatment of bacterial mixed infections, including in clinical situations in which multi-resistant organisms are suspected.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among enterobacteriaceae in intensive care units in taiwan.
AB  == to determine the antimicrobial resistance profiles among clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae in taiwanese intensive care units (icus), a national surveillance of antibiotic resistance among important enterobacteriaceae was conducted from september 2005 through november 2005 at the icus of ten major teaching hospitals in taiwan. a total of 574 enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from various clinical samples of our icu patients were submitted for in vitro test. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of these isolates to 18 antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method. the prevalences of enterobacteriaceae isolates with phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production were 26% in klebsiella pneumoniae, 16% in serratia marcescens, 14% in escherichia coli, and 13% in proteus mirabilis, in which a significantly rising prevalence of esbl production among k. pneumoniae was noted (p = 0.002) when compared with a previous taiwanese survey in 2000. heterogeneous resistance to various fluoroquinolones was found among our enterobacteriaceae isolates, except for enterobacter cloacae. emergence of ertapenem-resistant isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, and s. marcescens was noted. gradually increasing rates of drug-resistant enterobacteriaceae were noted in taiwanese icus. periodic surveillance of the evolutionary trend of antimicrobial resistance among icu isolates is crucial for  starting appropriately empirical antimicrobial therapy in the future.

TI  == identification of enterobacteriaceae on vacuum loaders in shell egg processing.
AB  == cleaning and sanitation are paramount in food processing. gaining an understanding of the microbial populations present in a processing facility can help in the development of effective and efficient cleaning. the current study was undertaken to gain a better understanding of the enterobacteriaceae present on vacuum loader cups used in shell egg processing to transfer nest run eggs to the processing line. twenty cups were rinsed on each of 3 visits to both an off-line operation and a mixed operation. a total of 442 enterobacteriaceae isolates were biochemically identified from vacuum loader cup rinses. the predominant genera isolated from the 2 facilities were enterobacter, klebsiella,  escherichia, citrobacter, and serratia. the primary organisms from the off-line facility were klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter amnigenus 2, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the isolates found in the greatest proportion from the mixed operation were enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca. a total of 18 genera  were recovered from the 2 facilities, with 9 being present in both processing facilities. the findings of this study can be used in assessing the sources of bacterial contamination in egg processing and in developing more effective, targeted cleaning programs for processing equipment and facilities.

AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == urease-positive bacteria in the stomach induce a false-positive reaction in a urea breath test for diagnosis of helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == this study investigated the influence of urease-positive non-helicobacter pylori  bacteria on the results of a urea breath test (ubt) to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a ubt using film-coated [(13)c]urea tablets. the ubt was performed in  102 patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor and antibiotics for the eradication of h. pylori. urease-producing bacteria other than h. pylori were isolated and identified from the oral cavity and stomach. in 4/102 patients, the  ubt gave false-positive results. these false-positive results were found to be caused by the presence of urease-positive bacteria in the oral cavity and stomach. five bacterial species with urease activity (proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and staphylococcus aureus) were subsequently isolated from the oral cavity and/or stomach. as there was no correlation between the in vitro urease activity of urease-positive non-h. pylori bacteria and the ubt value, and all of the patients with a false-positive ubt result were suffering from atrophic gastritis, it is possible that the false-positive results in the ubt were a result of colonization of urease-positive bacteria and gastric hypochlorhydric conditions. thus, for the diagnosis of h. pylori infection using a ubt, the influence of stomach bacteria must be considered when interpreting the results.

TI  == influence of extended-spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance.
AB  == purpose: the influence of extended- spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance was studied. methods: hospital pharmacists were asked to provide data on antimicrobial use and bacterial susceptibilities. defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam were assessed for significant associations with gram-negative susceptibility. to account for midyear changes in usage patterns and the lag between changes in usage and resistance, susceptibility over two-year periods was evaluated. results: susceptibility data of more than 300,000 gram-negative isolates, representing 10 species of interest, were provided by 82  u.s. hospitals. two-year periods (n = 45) were evaluable for 25 hospitals, containing 159 hospital-years of data and 204,513 clinical isolates. use of cefepime increased, while use of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam decreased. excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteria were most susceptible to cefepime, followed by piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime. significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics themselves were observed with ceftazidime (enterobacter aerogenes) and ceftriaxone (escherichia coli). extended-spectrum beta-lactams associated with significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to other beta-lactams included cefepime (e. aerogenes and e. coli susceptibility to ceftazidime), ceftazidime (enterobacter cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), ceftriaxone (e. cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), piperacillin-tazobactam (e. cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa susceptibility to cefepime). there were insufficient susceptibility data to allow for impact analysis for piperacillin-tazobactam. conclusion: use of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with variably changing susceptibilities of several key gram-negative bacteria, either to themselves or to each other. despite the increased use of cefepime, gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cefepime remained high.

AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of raw milk used in the  manufacture of sao jorge, a protected denomination of origin portuguese semihard  cheese, as well as to ascertain the sanitary conditions prevailing during its processing. viable counts of enterobacteriaceae and micrococcaceae were accordingly obtained, pertaining to 21 independent batches (including samples of  raw milk, curd, and cheeses after 1, 3, and 4 months of ripening), from 7 dairy farms. standard plate counts (log cfu per milliliter or per gram) ranged from 6.1 to 8.6 in raw milk, whereas they ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 in 4-month-old cheeses. viable counts of enterobacteriaceae ranged between 5.9 and 7.0 in raw milk and between 0.0 and 1.3 in 4-month-old cheeses. species identified within this family encompassed klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sakazakii, and escherichia coli; klebsiella ornithinolytica, klebsiella terrigena, and serratia odorifera were detected only in raw milk. no salmonella whatsoever could be detected in any of the samples. viable counts of micrococcaceae ranged between 4.7 and 5.9 and between 1.3 and 3.3 in raw milk and 4-month-old cheeses, respectively. species identified within this family encompassed staphylococcus sciuri, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus (which was found mainly in ripened cheeses), and staphylococcus aureus (which was not detected in 4-month-old cheeses). accompanying physicochemical analyses included determination of moisture, salt, and ph. statistical analyses revealed a negative correlation between salt content and viable numbers of enterobacteriaceae in cheese, whereas in the case of micrococcaceae, a more negative correlation was found between viable numbers and  moisture content than between viable numbers and ph. the results of our study indicate, in general, poor milk handling conditions in all farms, given that the  indicators total mesophile and enterobacteriaceae counts were high, between 100-  and 1,000-fold those enforced by international standards pertaining to the matrices in question. however, by the time of regular consumption (i.e., after 4  months of ripening), sao jorge cheeses exhibit low levels of contamination by enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus, as well as absence of salmonella.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == a plasmid-borne shewanella algae gene, qnra3, and its possible transfer in vivo between kluyvera ascorbata and klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == the plasmid-borne quinolone resistance gene qnra1 is prevalent in multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae. a chromosomally encoded homologue in shewanella algae, qnra3, has been described. we isolated two qnra3-positive strains, one of klebsiella pneumoniae (he96) and one of kluyvera ascorbata (kas96), from the feces of an immunocompromised outpatient. the qnra3 allele was  identical to that of s. algae except for 5 nucleotides and differed from qnra1 by 29 nucleotides affecting three amino acids. the analysis of the qnra3 genetic environment showed that qnra3 was inserted downstream from an iscr1 element at a  recombination crossover site described for other resistance genes, including qnra1, and immediately upstream from is26, a situation not described before. is26 preceded an incomplete class 1 integron which contained, among other genes, aac(6')-ib-cr, another transferable quinolone resistance gene, and the beta-lactamase gene bla(oxa-1/30). the 10-kb fragment encompassing qnra3 was compared to previously described qnra1-containing plasmids and multidrug-resistant plasmids; it shares identical sequences with pc15a, phsh2, pqr1, pqkp311h, and psal-1 but with rearrangements, deletions, and mutations. conjugal transfer of qnra3 was highly efficient (10(-2)) from k. pneumoniae he96  or k. ascorbata kas96 to escherichia coli j53 but less so (10(-5)) from either donor to a clinical strain of enterobacter cloacae. this first description of a plasmid-borne copy and of the in vitro transfer of qnra3 is taken to illustrate its likely in vivo transfer from s. algae to the enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == objectives: the ctx-m-25 family of beta-lactamases is a closely related family of enzymes found rarely in the world. we aimed to describe the occurrence and to understand the dissemination of this extended-spectrum beta-lactamase family among enterobacteriaceae strains in our hospital. methods: fifty-four ctx-m-producing enterobacteriaceae strains collected from 2000 to 2005 were screened for bla(ctx-m-25) genes by pcr and sequencing. genetic relatedness was analysed by pfge. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by vitek-2. plasmids encoding bla(ctx-m-25)-type genes were isolated, transformed and analysed by southern blot using a bla(ctx-m-25) probe. chromosomal location of bla(ctx-m-25)-type was studied by i-ceui restriction analysis. the bla(ctx-m-25)  genetic environment was characterized by pcr mapping and partial sequencing. results: ten out of 54 ctx-m-producing isolates (18.5%) carried bla(ctx-m-25) genes, including klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), escherichia coli (n = 3), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and proteus mirabilis (n = 2). isolates were genetically unrelated. four beta-lactamases were found: ctx-m-25, ctx-m-26, ctx-m-39 and ctx-m-41, a new member of the family (accession no. dq023162) that differed from ctx-m-25 in three amino acids, ala80val, val106ile and ile126ser. bla(ctx-m-25)-type genes were plasmid-mediated in all genera but p. mirabilis, organized in a class i integron and located downstream of an isecp1 element. the  genes were encoded on different plasmids with varying degree of similarities. several antibiotic-resistant determinants conferring resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides existed on the same integron. conclusions: bla(ctx-m-25) exists in israel in different enteric species. spread of these enzymes within and between species is due to transfer of plasmids with common regions and by dissemination of determinants encoding these genes. ctx-m-41, a novel member of this family, was identified in the chromosome of p. mirabilis.

TI  == clinical experience of serious infections caused by enterobacteriaceae producing  vim-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in a greek university hospital.
AB  == background: the dissemination of acquired metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) in members of the family enterobacteriaceae is regarded as an emerging clinical threat. the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 17 cases of infection due to mbl-producing isolates were analyzed. methods: during a 3-year period, medical records for all patients with confirmed infection due to an mbl-producing strain  belonging to the enterobacteriaceae family were retrospectively analyzed. we screened for mbl production with the imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disk synergy test, and results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. genetic relatedness between isolates was evaluated by repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. results: fourteen cases of bacteremia and  3 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to an mbl-producing isolate were studied. most of the patients had previously been colonized with an mbl-producing organism, and almost 60% had been exposed to carbapenems before infection. the isolated pathogens (klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 cases; and klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter aerogenes, 1 case each) exhibited variable minimum inhibitor concentrations of carbapenems (1 to >32 microg/ml) and resistance to most other beta-lactams. tigecycline was active against all isolates, whereas colistin and gentamicin were active against 88% of them. molecular studies confirmed the presence of a gene belonging to bla(vim-1) cluster in all isolates. among the 12 k. pneumoniae isolates, which were subjected to molecular typing, 11 distinct clones were identified. five cases ( approximately 30%) occurred in patients who were already receiving carbapenem-containing treatment, and carbapenem treatment was considered to have  failed. twelve cases were treated with a colistin-containing regimen. the attributable mortality rate was 18.8%. conclusions: mbl-producing enterobacteriaceae can cause severe, often fatal infection in severely ill patients, irrespective of the mic of carbapenems. colonization with an mbl-producer is a preceding event, highlighting the importance of surveillance. both infection control practices and antibiotic policies should be intensified to contain the spread of these problematic bacteria.

TI  == molecular and descriptive epidemiologyof multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae in hospitalized infants.
AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae (mdre) in hospitalized infants. methods: from 2000 through 2005, active surveillance cultures for mdre were performed for patients admitted  to a 40-bed neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) that provides care for critically ill infants 6 months of age or younger. mdre epidemiology and the genetic relatedness of mdre strains determined by repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction were analyzed. results: active surveillance cultures revealed that 759 (23%) of 3,370 nicu infants (or approximately 1 in 5) developed mdre colonization or infection and that 613 (72%) of the 853 isolates with epidemiologic data available were healthcare acquired. mdre colonization occurred more frequently (in 653 infants [86%]) than did mdre infection (in 106 [14%]). of the 653 infants with mdre colonization, 119 (18%) eventually became infected, with 29 (4%) acquiring sterile site infections. the most commonly isolated organisms were the  enterobacter species, accounting for 612 (71%) of the 862 isolates. molecular epidemiologic analysis revealed that genetic-relatedness clustering (related clusters defined as having a genetic similarity coefficient greater than 95%) varied depending on microbial species. clustering was detected for 36 (78%) of the 46 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 22 (45%) of the 49 enterobacter cloacae isolates, and 13 (59%) of the 22 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. conclusion: hospitalized infants are at significant risk of acquiring mdre, specifically enterobacter species, at the study institution. active surveillance cultures identified colonized patients who likely contributed to the institutional reservoir of mdre. molecular epidemiologic studies suggest that both patient-to-patient transmission and de novo acquisition of resistance play a role in the acquisition of these organisms, and that the clinical significance of such acquisition varies by species. the high percentage of e. aerogenes isolates that  demonstrated genetic clustering suggests that monitoring the prevalence of this organism could serve as a useful measure of compliance with infection control procedures.

TI  == in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, an anti-mrsa cephalosporin, against recent gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of european origin.
AB  == objectives: to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), for use as a contemporary baseline to help detect any changes in its activity profile throughout the course of clinical development and use. methods: mics were determined by broth microdilution testing for ceftobiprole and comparators against 6680 isolates [1201 s. aureus, 460 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 526 streptococcus pneumoniae, 1213 escherichia coli, 854 klebsiella pneumoniae, 443 proteus mirabilis, 406 enterobacter cloacae, 387 citrobacter spp., 291 serratia marcescens, 621 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 278 acinetobacter spp.] from 31 sites in 12 countries. results: ceftobiprole activity against mrsa (mic90 2 mg/l) was 4-fold less than the activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic90 0.5 mg/l) and a similar trend was observed for methicillin-resistant cons (mic90 2 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible cons (mic90 0.25 mg/l). activity against s. pneumoniae (mic90s: penicillin-susceptible, 0.015 mg/l; -intermediate, 0.25 mg/l; -resistant, 0.5 mg/l) was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. ceftobiprole activity against enterobacteriaceae (mic90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 0.12 mg/l;  non-susceptible, >32 mg/l), p. aeruginosa (mic90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 8 mg/l, non-susceptible, >32 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (mic90: >32 mg/l for imipenem-susceptible and non-susceptible) was comparable to that of cefepime. as  with cefepime, ceftobiprole activity was decreased among cephalosporin-resistant  isolates of gram-negative bacilli [extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or non-esbl mediated]. conclusions: ceftobiprole demonstrated potent in vitro activity against mrsa and showed activity against key gram-negative bacilli comparable to that of cefepime. given this broad spectrum of activity, ceftobiprole appears well suited for development and use in the treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of isepamicin and other aminoglycosides against clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial bloodstream infections.
AB  == background and purpose: isepamicin is a newly introduced aminoglycoside in taiwan. since in vitro data for isepamicin against nosocomial gram-negative bloodstream infection from taiwan are limited, we compared the activity of isepamicin, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin against nosocomial gram-negative  blood isolates. methods: a total of 247 non-duplicate nosocomial blood isolates of gram-negative bacteria collected between january 2003 and december 2003 in a major teaching hospital in taiwan were tested for their in vitro susceptibilities to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and isepamicin using the agar dilution method. the isolates included escherichia coli (31 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (31), enterobacter cloacae (30), serratia marcescens (31), morganella  morganii (21), citrobacter freundii (10), pseudomonas aeruginosa (31), acinetobacter baumannii (31), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31). results: overall, isepamicin had high antibacterial activity against the tested gram-negative bacteria. for the 154 enterobacteriaceae isolates, isepamicin had the lowest minimum concentration inhibiting 90% of isolates (mic90) among the tested drugs, while its resistance rate (3.9%) was equal to that of amikacin (3.9%) and lower than those of tobramycin (18.2%) and gentamicin (21.4%). for the 93 of non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli isolates, isepamicin had the lowest  mic90, and a resistance rate (23.7%) lower than those of amikacin (27.9%), tobramycin (38.7%) and gentamicin (40.9%). conclusions: the in vitro activity of  isepamicin against gram-negative bacteria isolates was equal or similar to amikacin and superior to other tested aminoglycosides. in view of its potential for less nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity than other aminoglycosides, isepamicin is a drug of choice for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections caused by gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == composition of intestinal enterobacteriaceae populations of healthy domestic pigs.
AB  == in this study, the enterobacteriaceae microbiota, including their diversity as well as the distribution of haemolytic and virulence gene-harbouring escherichia  coli of 56-day-old healthy piglets, was characterized. both the composition and the diversity of enterobacteriaceae populations varied considerably between individual pigs and intestinal sections. e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae dominated the enterobacteriaceae microbiota. however, mucosa-associated enterobacteriaceae were scarce or in some  cases undetectable. the majority of e. coli clones from the jejunum were also found in the colon, with up to 10 different e. coli clones in one intestinal section. other enterobacteriaceae species were represented by only one clone localized to one intestinal section. while several piglets did not harbour virulence gene-positive or haemolytic e. coli, such strains dominated intestinal  sections of other animals. this study reveals that the diversity of intestinal enterobacteriaceae is clearly individual. in general, enterobacteriaceae do not appear to be a consistent fraction of the microbiota of the jejunum. high numbers of adherent bacteria do not appear to be essential for successful intestinal colonization, and e. coli clones do not necessarily colonize distinct intestinal  sections based on the particular phylogenetic affiliation. furthermore, dominance of haemolytic or virulence gene-positive e. coli does not correlate with disease. finally, probiotic enterococcus faecium feed supplementation does not affect the  enterobacteriaceae microbiota.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

TI  == [pathogenic bacteria distribution and drug resistance analysis in burns department].
AB  == objective: to study the distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacterium  and find the proper measures of infection control. methods: six hundred and eighty-two pathogenic bacteria strains were isolated and cultured from samples collected from january 2003 to december 2005. the pathogenic bacterium distribution and antibiotic resistance were analyzed. results: the detection rate of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive ones. the gram-positive bacteria accounted for 292 strains (42.8%), in which the detection rate of staphylococcus aureus is highest (16.7% of total) and the detection rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus accounted for 82.5% in staphylococcus aureus strains. among 372 gram-negative bacteria strains (54.5%), the detection rate of bacillus aeruginosa, escherichia coli, baumannii and enterobacter cloacae were 12.5%, 11.1%, 9.1% and 8.2% respectively; extended-spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls) were detected in 45 (60.8%) escherichia coli and 9 (42.9%) klebsiella pneumoniae strains. eighteen strains of fungus were found, and it decreased in last 2 years. the detection rate of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and the antibiotic resistant strains kept increasing in the 3 years. conclusions: drug resistance of pathogenic bacterium is very serious in burns department. the irrational use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the antibiotic detection of pathogenic bacterium are all contributed to the drug resistance. it is important  to enhance the asepsis, prevent hospital infection, detect the pathogenic bacteria and use antibiotics rationally in burns department.

TI  == a bacterial population study of commercialized wastewater inoculants.
AB  == aims: to assess the bacterial diversity and safety of wastewater inoculants, which are commercially available products used to improve the aerobic digestion processes of the domestic waste compost in the septic tank. methods and results:  eighteen wastewater inoculants were analysed on nonselective and selective media  and the cultivable bacteria were identified. in all wastewater inoculants, the number of cfus were between 10(4) and 10(7) g(-1) powder on nonselective media and bacillus was the predominant cultivable genus. culture-independent molecular  methods such as sequencing of 16s rrna clone libraries and denaturating gradient  gel electrophoresis demonstrated the high prevalence of interfering chloroplast 16s rrna from plant material and the presence of bacillus spp. only after selective enrichments and cultivation, the presence of one pathogenic strain (klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae) and one opportunistic strain of (enterobacter cloacae) bacteria were detected in six different products. conclusion: the predominant cultivable species of the wastewater inoculants were  bacillus spp. and after enrichment six products were found to contain opportunistic or pathogenic strains. significance and impact of the study: the presence of opportunistic pathogenic strains in the inoculants might represent a  risk for immunocompromised, the elderly or children. a clear labelling should therefore be displayed on the product.

TI  == complex clonal and plasmid epidemiology in the first outbreak of enterobacteriaceae infection involving vim-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in spain: toward endemicity?
AB  == background: we report the emergence and spread of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls)  among enterobacterial isolates at ramon y cajal university hospital (madrid, spain). methods and results: during the period from march 2005 through september  2006, 25 patients (52% of whom were in the intensive care unit) were infected and/or colonized with single or different mbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 patients; enterobacter cloacae, 12 patients;  escherichia coli, 1 patient; and/or klebsiella oxytoca, 1 patient). clonal analysis (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) revealed that all k. pneumoniae  isolates belonged to the same clone, but 6 patterns were found among the e. cloacae isolates. carbapenems were affected to different degrees (minimum inhibitory concentration, < or = 1 to > 8 microg/ml), as were aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin. the bla(vim-1) mbl gene was present in all isolates; in addition,  the bla(shv-12) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene was detected in k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates. the bla(vim-1) gene was detected within a 4.0-kb class 1 integron (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-dfrii-aada1-catb2) in k. pneumoniae and e. coli and in a 2.5-kb class 1 integron (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-aada1) in e. cloacae and  k. oxytoca isolates. the bla(vim-1) gene was transferable (filter-mating) in 14 of 14 k. pneumoniae isolates, 4 of 11 e. cloacae isolates, and 1 of 1 e. coli isolate. a 60-kb plasmid belonging to the inci1 group was detected in the epidemic vim-1-k. pneumoniae clone. plasmids of 300- or 435-kb belonging to inch12 group were found among e. cloacae isolates. conclusions: k. pneumoniae-mbl monoclonal epidemics coexisted with e. cloacae-mbl multiclonal epidemics in our hospital. the spread of the bla(vim-1) gene among enterobacteriaceae was driven by clonal spread associated with intergeneric plasmid transfer with different class i integron platforms. such complex epidemiology might anticipate endemicity and should be considered for the design of containment epidemiology strategies.

TI  == dry stress and survival time of enterobacter sakazakii and other enterobacteriaceae in dehydrated powdered infant formula.
AB  == powdered infant formula is not a sterile product, and opportunistic pathogens could multiply in the reconstituted product, resulting in neonatal infections. in this study, the generation of sublethally injured enterobacteriaceae during desiccation and their persistence in dehydrated powdered infant formula was assessed during a 2.5-year period. the study included 27 strains of enterobacter  sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella enteritidis, citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, escherichia vulneris, pantoea spp., klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the number of sublethally injured  cells generated during desiccation was lower for k. oxytoca, pantoea spp., salmonella enteritidis, and capsulated strains of e. sakazakii than for the other enterobacteriaceae. the enterobacteriaceae could be divided into three groups with respect to their long-term survival in the desiccated state. c. freundii, c. koseri, and e. cloacae were no longer recoverable after 6 months, and salmonella  enteritidis, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli could not be recovered after 15 months. pantoea spp., k. oxytoca, and e. vulneris persisted over 2 years, and some capsulated strains of e. sakazakii were still recoverable after 2.5 years.

TI  == structure--activity study of the antibacterial peptide fallaxin.
AB  == fallaxin is a 25-mer antibacterial peptide amide, which was recently isolated from the west indian mountain chicken frog leptodactylus fallax. fallaxin has been shown to inhibit the growth of several gram-negative bacteria including enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. here, we report a structure-activity study of fallaxin based on 65 analogs, including a complete alanine scan and a full set of n- and c-terminal truncated analogs. the fallaxin analogs were tested for hemolytic activity and antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-intermediate resistant s. aureus, (visa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa. we identified several analogs, which showed improved antibacterial activity compared to fallaxin. our best candidate was fa12, which displayed mic values of 3.12, 25, 25, and 50 mum against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, mssa, and visa, respectively. furthermore, we correlated the antibacterial activity with various structural parameters such as charge, hydrophobicity h, mean hydrophobic  moment mu(h), and alpha-helicity. we were able to group the active and inactive analogs according to mean hydrophobicity h and mean hydrophobic moment mu(h). far-uv cd-spectroscopy experiments on fallaxin and several analogs in buffer, in  tfe, and in membrane mimetic environments (small unilamellar vesicles) indicated  that a coiled-coil conformation could be an important structural trait for antibacterial activity. this study provides data that support fallaxin analogs as promising lead structures in the development of new antibacterial agents.

TI  == microbiological quality of indoor and outdoor swimming pools in greece: investigation of the antibiotic resistance of the bacterial isolates.
AB  == during 1997-2005, the microbiological quality and susceptibility of bacterial isolates of swimming pool waters were investigated. a total of 462 water samples  were collected from three indoor swimming pools (a teaching pool, a competition public pool, a hydrotherapy pool) and two outdoor swimming pools (a hotel semi-public and a residential private pool) in northwestern greece. all water samples were analyzed for the presence of bacteria, protozoa and fungi and susceptibility tests were performed for the bacterial isolates. sixty-seven percent of the examined water samples conformed to the microbiological standards  and 32.9% exceeded at least one of the indicated limits. out of 107 bacterial isolates, 38 (35.5%) resistant strains were detected. multi-resistant pseudomonas alcaligenes, leuconostoc, and staphylococcus aureus (isolated from the teaching pool), staphylococcus wernerii, chryseobacterium indologenes and ochrobactrum anthropi (isolated from the competition pool), pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, aeromonas hydrophila, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus (isolated from the hydrotherapy pool) and a. hydrophila (isolated from the hotel pool) were detected. the swimming pool with the poorest microbiological quality (thc 500 cfu/ml in 12.1% of the samples, p. aeruginosa counts 1500 cfu/100 ml in 6% of the samples) and the highest prevalence of multi-resistant isolates (73.6%) was the hydrotherapy pool. no cryptosporidium or giardia cysts and no legionella, mycobacteria and salmonella were detected, but there were isolations of candida albicans, aspergillus spp., mucor spp., alternaria spp., rhizopus spp., trichophyton spp., and penicillium spp.

TI  == postcollection synthesis of ethyl glucuronide by bacteria in urine may cause false identification of alcohol consumption.
AB  == background: ethyl glucuronide (etg) is a minor ethanol metabolite used as a specific marker to document recent alcohol consumption; confirm abstinence in treatment programs, workplaces, and schools; and provide legal proof of drinking. this study examined if bacterial pathogens in urine may enable postsampling synthesis of etg and ethyl sulfate (ets) from ethanol, leading to clinical false-positive results. methods: urine specimens with confirmed growth of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, or enterobacter cloacae were stored at room temperature in the presence of ethanol. ethanol was either added to the samples or generated by inoculation with the fermenting yeast species candida albicans and glucose as substrate. etg and ets were measured by lc-ms. results: high concentrations of etg (24-h range 0.5-17.6 mg/l) were produced during storage in 35% of e. coli-infected urines containing ethanol. in some specimens that were initially etg positive because of recent alcohol consumption, etg was also sensitive to degradation by bacterial hydrolysis. in contrast, ets was completely stable under these conditions. conclusions: the presence of etg in urine is not a unique indicator of recent drinking, but might originate from postcollection synthesis if specimens are infected with e. coli and contain ethanol. given the associated risks for false identification of alcohol consumption and false-negative etg results due to bacterial degradation, we recommend that measurement of etg be combined with ets, or in the future possibly replaced by ets.

TI  == carbapenemases: the versatile beta-lactamases.
AB  == carbapenemases are beta-lactamases with versatile hydrolytic capacities. they have the ability to hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems. bacteria producing these beta-lactamases may cause serious infections in which the carbapenemase activity renders many beta-lactams ineffective. carbapenemases are members of the molecular class a, b, and d beta-lactamases. class a and d enzymes have a serine-based hydrolytic mechanism,  while class b enzymes are metallo-beta-lactamases that contain zinc in the active site. the class a carbapenemase group includes members of the sme, imi, nmc, ges, and kpc families. of these, the kpc carbapenemases are the most prevalent, found  mostly on plasmids in klebsiella pneumoniae. the class d carbapenemases consist of oxa-type beta-lactamases frequently detected in acinetobacter baumannii. the metallo-beta-lactamases belong to the imp, vim, spm, gim, and sim families and have been detected primarily in pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, there are increasing numbers of reports worldwide of this group of beta-lactamases in the enterobacteriaceae. this review updates the characteristics, epidemiology, and detection of the carbapenemases found in pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == enterobacter cloacae has been associated with several outbreaks, usually involving strains that overproduce chromosomal beta-lactamase or, uncommonly, strains expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). only sporadic cases  of esbl-producing e. cloacae have been identified in our hospital in recent years. we describe the epidemiology and clinical and microbiological characteristics of an outbreak caused by esbl-producing e. cloacae in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (ct-icu). prospective surveillance of patients with infection or colonization by esbl-producing e. cloacae among patients admitted to the ct-icu was performed during the outbreak. production of esbl was  determined by decreased susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and a  positive double-disk test result. clone relatedness was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). from july to september 2005, seven patients in the ct-icu with esbl-producing e. cloacae were identified (four males; median age, 73 years; range, 45 to 76 years); six patients had cardiac surgery. four patients developed infections; three had primary bacteremia, one had ventilator-associated pneumonia, and one had tracheobronchitis. esbl-producing e. cloacae showed resistance to quinolones and aminoglycosides. pfge revealed two patterns. five isolates belonged to clone a; two carried a single esbl (pi 8.2 and a positive pcr result for the shv type), and three carried two esbls (pis 8.1 and 8.2 and positive pcr results for the shv and ctx-m-9 types). isolates belonging to clone b carried a single esbl (pi 5.4 and a positive pcr result for the tem type). review of antibiotic consumption showed increased use of cefepime and quinolones during june and july 2005. the outbreak  was stopped by the implementation of barrier measures and cephalosporin restriction. esbl production could be increasingly common in nosocomial pathogens other than escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == [drug-resistant bacteria isolated from pharyngeal swab cultures and urine in acutely or chronically febrile elderly nursing home inmates].
AB  == aim: patients in nursing homes are becoming more and more elderly and also prone  to infectious diseases. it is important to select proper antimicrobial agents in  treating such patients because of the increase in drug-resistant bacteria in recent years. methods: pathogenic aerobic bacteria were isolated from cultures of the pharyngeal swab obtained from patients with acute febrile episodes and those  with chronic febrile conditions with a repetition of fever or continuing low-grade fever. isolation of pathogens was also carried out in patients with a urinary tract infection that was resistant to treatment. isolated bacteria were tested for sensitivity to commonly used antimicrobial agents. results: pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 33% of the patients with acute febrile episodes, while they were isolated from 75% of the patients with chronic febrile conditions. the number of major pathogenic bacteria from 85 isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 13, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) 6, streptococcus pneumoniae 8, beta-hemolytic streptococcus 5, klebsiella pneumoniae 10, and enterobacter cloacae 6. only two isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-sensitive (pssp), while the  others were penicillin-resistant (prsp) (1) or penicillin-insensitive (pisp) (5). among these 8 isolates, 5 were resistant to levofloxacin (lvfx). escherichia coli was isolated from the pharyngeal swab of 2 patients, one of the 2 isolates being  resistant to lvfx. escherichia coli was isolated from 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 5 of the 6 isolates were resistant to lvfx; with one of them  being extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). conclusion: the frequency of isolation of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens was extremely high among elderly patients in our nursing home compared to values reported from a nation-wide survey recently carried out in japan. in particular, attention should be focused  on the resistance of bacteria to fluoroquinolones.

TI  == efficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of early ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objectives: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a frequent complication of patients admitted to intensive care units (icus). ertapenem is a newer carbapenem with good in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing organisms. however, there are no clinical data to support the use of ertapenem in vap. our purpose is to evaluate the usefulness and safety of  ertapenem in the treatment of vap caused by susceptible esbl strains. methods: ertapenem 1 g daily intravenously was given to adult patients with signs and symptoms of vap beginning within 7 days of mechanical ventilation and caused by esbl-producing gram-negative organisms. results: from june 2005 to june 2006, we  enrolled 20 adult patients hospitalized in an icu and diagnosed with vap due to gram-negative esbl strains. causative organisms identified as esbl producers susceptible to ertapenem were klebsiella pneumoniae (alone in 10 cases and with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 4 cases), enterobacter cloacae (2), proteus mirabilis (2) and citrobacter freundii (2). clinical success was achieved in 16/20 (80%) of the clinically evaluable patients and in 15/20 (75%) of the microbiologically evaluable patients. the drug was well-tolerated; one patient presented a transient increase in liver enzymes. conclusions: we believe  this is one of the first reports to demonstrate that ertapenem has clinical utility in treating serious infections caused by esbl-producing organisms. ertapenem appears to be suitable for esbl vap therapy. this pilot study suggests  subsequent controlled randomized trials in this indication.

TI  == role of ceftazidime dose regimen on the selection of resistant enterobacter cloacae in the intestinal flora of rats treated for an experimental pulmonary infection.
AB  == objectives: the effect of ceftazidime dosing increments and frequency of dosing on the selection of ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter cloacae in the intestine was studied in rats, during treatment of a pulmonary infection caused by klebsiella pneumoniae. methods: rats with pulmonary infection (n = 10 per group)  received therapy with doses of ceftazidime at 3.1 to 400 mg/kg per day at a frequency of every 6,12 or 24 h for 18 days, starting 24 h after bacterial inoculation of the lung. emergence of resistance in intestinal e. cloacae was monitored by culturing fresh stool specimens at days 0, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43  on agar plates with (6.4 mg/l) and without ceftazidime. pharmacodynamic indices and time within the mutant selection window (msw) were assessed in infected rats  for each regimen. ceftazidime-resistant e. cloacae mutants were characterized by  determination of the beta-lactamase activity under cefoxitin-induced and non-induced conditions. results: a reduction of intestinal ceftazidime-susceptible e. cloacae was observed and showed a significant correlation with the fauc/mic at days 8, 15 and 22 and with the fcmax on days 8,  15, 22, 29 and 36. more rats treated with 12-25 and 50-100 mg/kg per day every 6  h were found colonized with ceftazidime-resistant e. cloacae mutants than animals treated every 12 h or every 24 h. the proportion of rats colonized with ceftazidime-resistant e. cloacae mutants at days 15, 36 and 43 correlated with the time during which ceftazidime plasma concentrations were within the boundaries of the msw. only at day 15 was a correlation demonstrated between the  fcmax and significantly fewer rats colonized with ceftazidime-resistant e. cloacae. ceftazidime-resistant e. cloacae mutants (mic >or= 128 mg/l) were characterized as stable derepressed mutants. conclusions: colonization with stable derepressed ceftazidime-resistant e. cloacae mutants particularly occurred when rats were exposed to moderate doses of ceftazidime (12-25 or 50-100 mg/kg per day) administered every 6 h. emergence of resistance was correlated with time within the msw.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  == three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md), the vitek 2 system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france), and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring, inc., west sacramento, ca), using routine testing panels. one hundred fifty putative esbl producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the clsi double-disk synergy test, and the etest esbl were also evaluated. biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. one hundred forty-seven isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were investigated. of these  isolates, 85 were identified as esbl producers by the reference method. the remaining isolates were identified as non-esbl producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal ampc, koxy, or shv enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. the system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of esbls was the phoenix (99%), followed by the vitek 2 (86%) and the microscan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (phoenix) to 78% (vitek 2). the performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. the sensitivities of the conventional test  methods ranged from 93 to 94%. the double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == occurrence and characterization of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2000-2004).
AB  == emergence and dissemination of enterobacteriaceae isolates harboring carbapenemases in various geographic regions represents a significant threat to the management of nosocomial infections. enterobacteriaceae isolates from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2000-2004) demonstrating decreased susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic], > or =2 mg/l) were evaluated for the production of metallo-beta-lactamases and serine carbapenemases using disk approximation and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests. carbapenemase-producing strains were epidemiologically typed by automated riboprinting and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) to establish clonality. among 37,557 enterobacteriaceae (5 genus groups) evaluated, 119 (0.32%) had increased carbapenem mic values, and a carbapenemase was identified in 51 (42.9%) of these strains. kpc-2 and kpc-3 were the most frequently occurring carbapenemases (24 isolates, 20.2%) in the united states and were detected in klebsiella spp, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens strains isolated in new york, arkansas, and virginia. sme-2-producing  s. marcescens were isolated in the new york city area, texas, and ohio, while nmc-a was found in one e. cloacae strain from new york. in contrast, metallo-beta-lactamases were prevalent in europe. imp-1-producing e. cloacae (11  isolates) were detected in turkey, while vim-1-producing strains were found in italy (enterobacter spp.) and greece (klebsiella pneumoniae). clonal dissemination of carbapenemase-producing strains was observed in several medical  centers on both continents. the occurrence of carbapenemases in various enterobacteriaceae remains rare but appears to be spreading geographically (not in latin america), mainly with metallo-beta-lactamases being found in mediterranean europe and kpc enzymes in the new york city area.

AB  == enterobacteria produce elementary chromosomal enzymes, beta-lactamases of class a: tem and shv (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae). these can give rise to  plasmid-coded broad-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) discovered in 1980 (e. coli,  k. pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae). the first cefotaximase (ctx-m, men-1) was reported in europe in 1990. this enzyme is far more active against cefotaxime than against ceftazidime and aztreonam. chromosomal hyperpoduction of k1 beta-lactamase differs from all other esbls due its sensitivity to ceftazidime (klebsiella oxytoca). however, not all enterobacteria are resistant only because  of esbls, but also as a result of the action of chromosomally or plasmid coded ampc beta-lactamase of class c (mir-1, cmy-1, bil-1, fox-1, mox-1, dha-1, acc-1), resistant to beta-lactamase inhibitors and to cefoxitin (enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, morganelle spp., serratia spp.). with the loss of outside-membrane porins (omp) they can become resistant to carbapenem an  tibiotics. the 100% resistance of enterobacteria to carbapenems that so far exists in this country is elsewhere in the world compromised by the incidence of  carbapenem-hydrolysing plasmid-determined beta-lactamase of class b (imp-1, vim-1) and of class a (kpc-1) in k. pneumoniae, (sme-1) in serratia marcescens and (imi-1, nmc-a) in e. clocae. carbapenemases in enterobacteria are only effective in the presence of impermeability and other resistance mechanisms.

TI  == [characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  == war wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas  to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. war wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types  of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. this environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. war wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. the infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection.  these are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. the determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. the etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family enterobacteriacea (escherichia coil, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus -  a. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; peptostreptococcus spp and peptococcus spp. the latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered  to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. the choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. it is  used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. the characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. the use of antibiotics is not a  substitution for surgical treatment. the expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. if the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. the keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == effect of tigecycline on normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora.
AB  == antibacterial agents disrupt the ecological balance of the normal human microflora. tigecycline, a member of a new class of antibiotics (glycylcyclines), has been shown to have a potent broad-spectrum activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the aim of the study was to investigate the ecological effects of tigecycline on the normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora of healthy subjects. thirteen healthy white subjects (six females and seven males) between 20 and 31 years of age received 100 mg of tigecycline in the morning on day 1 as a 30-min intravenous infusion followed by a 50-mg dose of tigecycline every 12 h as a 30-minute infusion for 10 days. one subject was withdrawn on day 2 because of an adverse event (urticaria). serum, saliva, and fecal samples were collected before, during, and after administration for microbiological cultivation and for assays of tigecycline. all new colonizing bacteria were tested for susceptibility (resistance of > or =8 mg/liter) during the investigation period. the fecal concentrations on day 8 were from 3.0 to 14.1 mg/kg, with a mean value of 6.0 mg/kg and a median value of 5.6 mg/kg. the saliva concentrations were generally low (0 to 0.12 mg/liter). a minor effect on the oropharyngeal microflora was observed. the numbers of enterococci and escherichia coli cells in the intestinal microflora were reduced at day 8 (p < 0.05), while those of other enterobacteria  and yeasts increased. there was a marked reduction of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (p < 0.05) but no impact on bacteroides. no clostridium difficile  strains were isolated. two klebsiella pneumoniae strains and five enterobacter cloacae strains resistant to tigecycline were found on day 8.

TI  == potential prophylactic value of bovine colostrum in necrotizing enterocolitis in  neonates: an in vitro study on bacterial attachment, antibody levels and cytokine production.
AB  == necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is an important disease of low birth-weight neonates. the immaturity of the gut mucosa may result in close contact between the host epithelium and microorganisms which are normally confined to the gut lumen. damage of the mucosa due to endotoxin, cytokine production or other factors is believed to then occur. the aim of this study was to determine whether spray-dried bovine colostrum demonstrated potential in vitro as a prophylactic for nec. antiadherence was measured using a tissue culture assay and antibody levels against enterobacteriaceae were determined by elisa. the effect of bovine  colostrum on the production of cytokines implicated in nec was determined by a multiplex bead assay. enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae were common in both nec positive and nec negative infants and iga and igg1 antibodies to these species were present in the bovine colostrum. pretreatment with bovine colostrum  produced a significant decrease (p<0.001) in attachment of bacteria to ht-29 cells. bovine colostrum significantly increased the production of il-8 in ht-29 cells and il-8, il-6 and tnf-alpha in thp-1 cells (p<0.001). the potential of bovine colostrum to increase the production of inflammatory mediators could limit its usefulness.

TI  == influence of culture site-specific mic distributions on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of piperacillin/tazobactam and piperacillin: a data analysis.
AB  == background: investigators who perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) modeling with monte carlo simulation have historically not stratified microbiological data by culture site. this lack of stratification might be problematic if susceptibility patterns differ among sites and might lead to differences in pk-pd. objective: this study compared the pk-pd of 2 antimicrobial regimens against 5 gram-negative bacterial species form 3 culture sites. methods: this data analysis was performed at the department of pharmacology, the university of texas health science center, san antonio, texas. blood, pulmonary (ie, bronchial, endotracheal, lung, respiratory, sputum, and tracheal secretions), and wound distributions of mics were extracted from the 2002 intensive care unit surveillance system database. bacteria included acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the pk properties of piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 4 hours) and piperacillin (3 g every 4 hours) were obtained from studies in healthy volunteers. monte carlo simulation was used in 10,000 patients for each antimicrobial-bacteria-culture site combination. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for a free percentage time above the mic of > or =50% was determined for each combination, and a clinically significant difference was defined a priori as > or =10%. results: data from 2408 pulmonary, 490 blood, and  242 wound isolates were included. for piperacillin/tazobactam, the cfr varied <10% by culture site in all 5 bacterial species. site-specific differences were noted in mic50 for piperacillin versus e cloacae and e coli and mic90 for piperacillin/tazobactam versus k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa. likewise, for piperacillin, the cfr was similar among the 3 culture sites for p aeruginosa. however, the cfr for piperacillin varied by > or =10% for a baumannii (blood > wound), e cloacae (pulmonary > blood), e coli (pulmonary and blood > wound), and  k pneumoniae (wound > blood). conclusions: the pk-pd models based on pk properties found in healthy humans and site-specific mic distributions in this study suggest that for piperacillin, culture-site differences subsequently resulted in cfr differences that exceeded a predetermined level of clinical significance. furthermore, these data suggest that traditional reporting strategies for microbiological data (ie, mic50 and mic90) might fail to adequately characterize the mic population.

AB  == bacteria harbouring the novel qnra plasmid-mediated mechanism of quinolone resistance have been described in different countries, but the frequency of their occurrence has not been investigated. in total, 1,468 clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae with quinolone resistance or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl) phenotypes were collected from eight teaching hospitals in france during 2002-2005 and screened for qnra. overall, 28 isolates (22 enterobacter cloacae, three klebsiella pneumoniae, one citrobacter freundii, one klebsiella oxytoca and one proteus mirabilis) were positive for qnra, representing 1.9% of all isolates, 3.3% of esbl-producing isolates (22% of the e. cloacae isolates) and 0% of non-esbl-producing isolates. the prevalence of qnra among consecutive esbl-producing isolates in 2004 from the eight hospitals was 2.8% (18/639). of the qnra-positive isolates, 100% were intermediately-resistant or resistant to nalidixic acid, and 75% to ciprofloxacin. twenty-one of the 22 qnra-positive e. cloacae isolates were obtained from two hospitals in the paris area, and molecular typing and plasmid content analysis showed clonal relationships for five, three and two isolates, respectively. the qnra genetic environment was similar to that of the in36 integron. the remaining two isolates had qnra variants (30 and 29 nucleotide differences, respectively, compared with the original sequence) and an unknown genetic environment. the esbl gene associated with qnra was bla(shv-12) in most of the isolates, but bla(per-1) and bla(shv-2a) were found in two isolates. in france, it appears that qnra-positive isolates are predominantly e. cloacae isolates producing shv-12, and may be associated with the dissemination of an in36-like integron.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae in lebanese icu patients: epidemiology and patterns of resistance.
AB  == our study aims to investigate and describe the epidemiology of the intestinal carriage of esbl-ps in intensive care units of five lebanese hospitals and to analyze the potential risk factors for the acquisition of these strains. at the same time, we intend to determine the patterns of susceptibility of these strains, exploring therefore the availability of alternative treatment. one thousand, four hundred forty-two fecal samples were collected between january 1,  2003 and march 31, 2003 from 378 patients admitted to the icus of five lebanese tertiary care general hospitals located in different areas of lebanon. esbl production was detected by the double disk synergy test and antibiotic susceptibility of esbl-producing strains as well as minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined. a paired case-control study was undertaken to identify risk factors for carriage of esbl-ps. one hundred eighteen strains isolated from 72 subjects were identified as esbl producers, including 95 (80.5%) e. coli, 16 (13.6%) klebsiella pneumoniae, and 7 (5.6%) enterobacter cloacae. a higher rate of multiple esbl-ps carriage was described among these acquisition cases (21 double carriages and 3 triple carriages of esbl-ps compared to only 1 double carriage of esbl-ps at admission). in general, similar trends of susceptibility were observed in the different hospitals. as expected, the lowest  mic was observed with imipenem for all e. coli, klebsiella, and enterobacter isolates. ciprofloxacin, followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole seem to be associated with the lowest susceptibility. in vitro susceptibility to cefoxitin for all isolates was 74.6%; more resistance was associated to ceftazidime (90.7%) than to cefotaxime (69.7%). our data agree with other national and international  reports showing the increase in esbl-ps carriage in icu patients. they demonstrate the endemic character of this carriage in lebanese hospitals and the  important risk factors including immunosuppression and evidence of esbl infection. the highly resistant profile of esbl-ps to antimicrobial agents available for treatment reflects the severity of this issue. the significance of  this study resides in the direct correlation between our results and the nationwide increase in multi-drug resistant bacteria and the continuous change in bacterial resistance epidemiology. our data may have an important impact on infection control policies in hospitals and on treatment of infectious diseases.

AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) efficiently hydrolyze extended-spectrum beta-lactams such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. esbls are most often plasmid-mediated. in taiwan, the prevalence of esbls in bacteria has risen, ranging from 8.5 to 29.8% in klebsiella pneumoniae and 1.5 to 16.7% in escherichia coli isolates. the most prevalent types of esbls are shv-5, shv-12, ctx-m-3, and ctx-m-14 in isolates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli, with differences  between institutions. shv-12 and ctx-m-3 have been reported as the most common esbls in isolates of enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively.  molecular epidemiology studies suggest that the esbl-encoding genes have been disseminated either by proliferation of epidemic strains or by transfer of plasmids carrying the resistance traits. the current esbl screen guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly national committee for  clinical laboratory standards) are issued for e. coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus mirabilis. owing to the lack of standard methods, it remains difficult to assure the presence of esbl in an isolate co-harboring an ampc beta-lactamase, particularly in cases where the latter is produced in larger amounts than the former. empirical therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam to replace third-generation cephalosporins may help to reduce the occurrence of esbls in an  institution with a high prevalence of esbl producers. carbapenems remain the drugs of choice for serious infections caused by esbl-producing organisms. to retard the selection for carbapenem-resistant bacteria, 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams or fourth-generation cephalosporins can be therapeutic alternatives  for mild-to-moderate infections provided that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic target can be easily achieved.

(n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == resistance in gram-negative bacteria: enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the emergence and spread of resistance in enterobacteriaceae are complicating the treatment of serious nosocomial infections and threatening to create species resistant to all currently available agents. approximately 20% of klebsiella pneumoniae infections and 31% of enterobacter spp infections in intensive care units in the united states now involve strains not susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. such resistance in k pneumoniae to third-generation cephalosporins is typically caused by the acquisition of plasmids containing genes that encode for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), and these plasmids often carry other resistance genes as well. esbl-producing k pneumoniae and escherichia coli are now relatively common in healthcare settings and often exhibit multidrug resistance. esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae have now emerged in the community as well. salmonella and other enterobacteriaceae that cause gastroenteritis may also be esbl producers, which is of relevance when children require treatment for invasive infections. resistance of enterobacter spp to third-generation cephalosporins is most typically caused by overproduction of ampc beta-lactamases, and treatment with third-generation cephalosporins may select for ampc-overproducing mutants. some enterobacter cloacae strains are now esbl and ampc producers, conferring resistance to both third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. quinolone resistance in enterobacteriaceae is usually the result of chromosomal mutations leading to alterations in target enzymes or drug accumulation. more recently, however, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance has been reported in k pneumoniae  and e coli, associated with acquisition of the qnr gene. the vast majority of enterobacteriaceae, including esbl producers, remain susceptible to carbapenems,  and these agents are considered preferred empiric therapy for serious enterobacteriaceae infections. carbapenem resistance, although rare, appears to be increasing. particularly troublesome is the emergence of kpc-type carbapenemases in new york city. better antibiotic stewardship and infection control are needed to prevent further spread of esbls and other forms of resistance in enterobacteriaceae throughout the world.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == confirmation of e. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  == paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. some are rich in wood  fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their  coliform microflora. therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. for the first series of analyses, the medium used was colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to  isolate bacteria in pure culture on macconkey agar. in a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase  activities, were used to isolate bacteria. first, the presence of thermotolerant  coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 mpn/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. from this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on macconkey medium and identified as citrobacter freundii, enterobacter sp, e. sakazakii, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, k. pneumoniae subsp.  ozaenae, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, pantoea sp, raoultella terrigena, r. planticola. second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 mpn/g (d.w) sludge, whereas e. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 mpn/g (d.w.) sludge. the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and e. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in  large quantities. also, indigenous e. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated e. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. in this second series of isolations, api20e and biolog identified most isolates as e. coli, but others remained unidentified. the sequences of the 16s rdna confirmed that most isolates were likely e. coli, few burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. this study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

TI  == ceftobiprole medocaril (bal5788) treatment of experimental haemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae murine pneumonia.
AB  == ceftobiprole (bal9141) is an investigational cephalosporin active against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant staphylococci administered as a water-soluble prodrug, ceftobiprole medocaril (bal5788). using an immunocompetent murine pneumonia model of haemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) nonproducing or producing klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia, we compared results of treatment with ceftobiprole medocaril (71 mg/kg, sc, qid), ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, im, bid), or cefepime (50 mg/kg, ip, q.i.d.). results were expressed as median and 25th to 75th percentile  log10 colony forming units per gram of lung tissue. ceftobiprole, ceftriaxone, and cefepime were each more active than was no treatment and were equally active  for treatment of experimental h. influenzae, e. cloacae, or esbl-nonproducing k.  pneumoniae pneumonia. for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, no differences were detected between no treatment and treatment with ceftobiprole, ceftriaxone, or cefepime. ceftobiprole is active against h. influenzae, e. cloacae, and esbl-nonproducing k. pneumoniae in an immunocompetent experimental murine pneumonia model.

TI  == first report of ctx-m-15 and ctx-m-3 beta-lactamases among clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae in bejaia, algeria.
AB  == we assessed the prevalence and phenotypic characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers among 365 clinical isolates of members of the family enterobacteriaceae recovered from two hospitals in bejaia, algeria, between march 2004 and april 2005. twenty-one strains were resistant to cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime. a double-disk synergy test yielded a positive result in five cases (three escherichia coli, one klebsiella pneumoniae and one enterobacter cloacae). using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, the three e. coli isolates and the k. pneumoniae isolate were found to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  ctx-m-15 and the e. cloacae isolate produced ctx-m-3. the three ctx-m-15-producing e. coli isolates were not isolated in the same wards, although genotyping by randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis revealed that they were clonally related. the bla(ctx-m-15) genes were transferred from e. coli by conjugation, whilst conjugative transfer of bla(ctx-m) genes from k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae was not detectable.

TI  == epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli  at siriraj hospital, thailand, 2003.
AB  == a cross-sectional study was conducted from august to september, 2003 to determine the prevalence and risk factors in acquiring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing gram-negative bacilli (gnb) in patients admitted to siriraj hospital and the outcomes of these infections. of 346 isolates of gram-negative bacteria in 249 patients, 102 isolates from 87 patients were colonization only, but 244 isolates from 162 patients were infections. the common gnb were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter cloacae. the overall prevalence of esbl producers was  30.1%. k. pneumoniae had a very high prevalence of esbl producers (56.9%). the urinary tract was the most common site for esbl- producing gnb infections. nosocomial infections, duration from admission to infection, peripheral line, urinary catheterization, nasogastric tube insertion and previous use of beta-lactams, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones were associated with acquiring  esbl-producing gnb infections. esbl-producing gnb were significantly more resistant to antimicrobial agents. more than 80% of esbl-producing gnb were susceptible to carbapenems. mortality in patients infected with esbl-producing gnb (41.3%) was significantly higher than those infected with non- esbl-producing gnb (19.8%).

TI  == qnrb, another plasmid-mediated gene for quinolone resistance.
AB  == a novel plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene, qnrb, has been discovered in  a plasmid encoding the ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase from a klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated in south india. it has less than 40% amino acid identity with the original qnr (now qnra) gene or with the recently described qnrs but, like them,  codes for a protein belonging to the pentapeptide repeat family. strains with qnrb demonstrated low-level resistance to all quinolones tested. the gene has been cloned in an expression vector attaching a polyhistidine tag, which facilitated purification to >or=95% homogeneity. as little as 5 pm of qnrb-his6 protected purified dna gyrase against inhibition by 2 microg/ml (6 microm) ciprofloxacin. with a pcr assay qnrb has been detected in citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli isolates from the united states, linked to shv-12 beta-lactamase and coding for a product differing in five amino  acids from the indian (now qnrb1) variety. the qnrb gene has been found near orf1005 in some, but not all, plasmids and in association with open reading frames matching known chromosomal genes, suggesting that it too was acquired by plasmids from an as-yet-unknown bacterial source.

TI  == characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing kuwait and  uk strains identified by the vitek system, and subsequent comparison of the vitek system with other commercial esbl-testing systems using these strains.
AB  == two hundred and fifty-one unique patient isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (123), escherichia coli (114), klebsiella oxytoca (7), enterobacter cloacae (5) and citrobacter freundii (2), flagged as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) positive by the vitek system (gns-526 card), were collected. these strains were isolated from a variety of clinical specimens submitted to the clinical bacteriology laboratories of the royal infirmary of edinburgh (rie), edinburgh, uk (and associated gp practices), hairmyers hospital, glasgow, uk, and the amiri  and farwania hospitals, kuwait. of the 101 rie strains tested, 15 e. coli strains were found to be esbl negative by etest esbl strips. on retesting the 15 e. coli  strains with the vitek gns-532 card, 14 were found to be esbl negative, despite being originally flagged as esbl positive. the remaining 236 esbl-producing strains were also subjected to the double disc-diffusion (ddd) technique for the  detection of esbls. of these, two were false negatives by etest esbl test strips  (using both cefotaxime and ceftazidime strips), and 38 were false negatives by the ddd method. the etest false-negative esbl-producing strains of k. pneumoniae  were positive by ddd. technically, the vitek method was the least demanding method to perform, as it was an integral part of the routine susceptibility test  card. etest strips were reliable, but were the most expensive of all the techniques used. the ddd test, while relatively inexpensive, was technically subjective, and in our hands, seven of the esbl-positive strains that were confirmed by the other two techniques were not detected. despite the false-positive esbl-producing e. coli strains, the vitek susceptibility card with its integral esbl test offers the clinical laboratory a valuable and quick option to screen for esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and e. coli as part of the routine laboratory methodology.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mic90 of mepm for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. mepm were active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (ipm) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (87.9%). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in proteus mirabilis. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which mic90 of  mepm was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in  conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful  carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == mechanical transmission of pathogenic organisms: the role of cockroaches.
AB  == background & objectives: cockroaches (diploptera punctata) are basically tropical insects and will do their best to find a home that is both warm and moist. their  involvement in the transmission of tropical diseases is poorly investigated in africa. methods: a study on the bacterial, fungal and parasitic profile of cockroaches trapped in and around houses in ekpoma was carried out using standard microbiological techniques. results: of a total of 234 cockroaches trapped from different sites (toilets, parlours, kitchens and bedrooms) in houses with pit latrines and water system, the bacterial, fungal and parasitic isolates were identical irrespective of the site, these included: e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serretia marcescens, s. aureus, s. feacalis, s. epidermidis, aeromonas sp, candida sp, rhizopus sp, aspergillus sp, mucor sp, cysts of e. hystolitica, oocysts of c. parvum, c. cayetenensis and isospora belli, cysts of balantidium coli, ova of ascaris lumbricoides, anchylostoma deodunalae, enterobius vermicularis, ova trichuris trichura, larva of strongyloides stercoralis. cockroaches trapped in the toilets  of houses with pit latrines had a mean bacterial and parasites count of 12.3 x 10(10) org/ml and 98 parasites/ml respectively, while those trapped in the houses with water system had a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 89.5 x 10(7) org/ml and 31 parasites/ml respectively. a bacterial count of 78.9 x 10(7) org/ml was recorded from cockroaches trapped from the kitchens of houses with pit latrines.  on the other hand a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 23.7 x 10(6) org/ml and 19 parasites/ml were recorded from kitchens of houses with water system. interpretation & conclusion: cockroaches represent an important reservoir for infectious pathogens, therefore, control of cockroaches will substantially minimise the spread of infectious diseases in our environment.

TI  == prevalences of zoonotic bacteria among seabirds in rehabilitation centers along the pacific coast of california and washington, usa.
AB  == many seabirds are rehabilitated annually by wildlife rehabilitation centers along the pacific coast, usa. although various strains of zoonotic bacteria have been isolated from seabirds, risks to rehabilitators at these centers have not been well documented. from november 2001 through january 2003, we determined the prevalence of detectable enteric fauna by isolation and characterization of gram-negative bacteria from cloacal swabs taken from 26 common murres (uria aalge), 49 gulls (larus spp.), and 14 other seabirds treated by rehabilitators in california and washington (usa). at least 25 bacterial species were identified, including multiple strains of escherichia coli, as well as enterobacter cloacae,  citrobacter freundii, and klebsiella pneumoniae. antibiotic resistance was found  in 13 of 19 bacterial isolates tested, including e. coli, k. pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. potential transfer of these bacteria poses a risk to wildlife rehabilitators and to seabirds in these centers, as well as to free-ranging birds.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == comparison of the minimum inhibitory, mutant prevention and minimum bactericidal  concentrations of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin against enteric gram-negative urinary tract infection pathogens.
AB  == acute, uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most commonly  encountered bacterial infections and management has been made more complicated in the last decade due to the trend toward increasing antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx). fluoroquinolones are suggested as alternative antimicrobials for the treatment of utis in communities  for which tmp/smx resistance is > or = 10%. the mutant-prevention concentration (mpc) is a novel susceptibility parameter designed to minimize the selection of first-step resistant mutants present in large, > or = 10(10) cfu/ml, heterogeneous bacterial populations and is a distinct measurement from minimum inhibitory concentration testing. we measured mpc results for 80 enteric gram-negative and 20 pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary isolates against ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin mpc results for escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa respectively were 0.5, 1, 1, 1 and 4 mg/l; 1, 2, 4, 2 and 16 mg/l; 1, 8, >8, 4 and > or = 32 mg/l. by comparison, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)90 results for the enterobacteriaceae organisms ranged from < or = 0.06-4 mg/l for the three drugs and 1-4 mg/l against p. aeruginosa. similarly, mbc90 results ranged from < or = 0.06-4 mg/l and 2-8 mg/l respectively. for ciprofloxacin against e. coli, e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae and for levofloxacin against e. coli, c. freundii and k. pneumoniae, mpc results were below susceptible breakpoints and within clinically achievable and sustainable drug concentrations for >24 hours of the dosing interval against. for garenoxacin, urine drug concentrations are expected  to be in excess of mpc results for the entire length of the dosing interval for e. coli. application of mpcs to fluoroquinolones and management of utis represents a situation where high levels of in vitro activity, based on low mics, is reflected in correspondingly low mpc values for most of the organisms tested.  incorporation of mpc strategies into current fluoroquinolone dosing in uti represents a realistic approach for preventing the further selection of resistant organisms associated with utis.

AB  == this study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use in a university hospital in taiwan. disk susceptibility data of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli causing nosocomial infections were evaluated. data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily dose (ddd) per 1000 patient-days) of extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, flumoxef, cefepime and cefpirome), beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (ticarcillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam), carbapenems (imipenem  and meropenem), aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin (oral and injectable) and oral levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) from 1991 to 2003 were analysed. increasing trends of incidences of several of these bacteria causing all nosocomial infections or nosocomial bloodstream infections were noted from 1991 to 2003. the annual patient-days of the hospital significantly increased, from 360210 in 1991 to 672676 in 2002 (linear regression analysis, p < 0.05), but slightly decreased in 2003 (629168) owing to the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in taiwan. the rise in cefotaxime-resistant or ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli and meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa was significantly correlated with increased consumption of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (for ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli and meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa only) in the hospital (pearson's correlation coefficient, r > 0.72 (or < -0.72) and p-value < 0.05). increased ciprofloxacin-resistant k. pneumoniae and meropenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. was significantly associated with the increased usage of extended-spectrum cephalosporins but not with the other four classes of antibiotics. this 13-year study in a hospital demonstrated significant changes in antimicrobial use, which may have affected antimicrobial resistance in certain gram-negative bacteria at the hospital.

TI  == dissemination of the metallo-beta-lactamase gene blaimp-4 among gram-negative pathogens in a clinical setting in australia.
AB  == background: the clinical utility of carbapenems is under threat because of the emergence of acquired metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) genes. we describe the first outbreak in australia of infection and/or colonization with gram-negative pathogens carrying the mbl gene blaimp-4. methods: mbl-producing organisms were identified using susceptibility data in conjunction with mbl screening methods. pcr and sequence analysis were performed to characterize the resistance gene and  identify the presence of integrons. dna profiles were determined by ribotyping. clinical and epidemiological data were prospectively collected from january-july  2004. results: a total of 19 isolates were recovered from 16 patients: serratia marcescens (10 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (4 isolates), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3 isolates), escherichia coli (1 isolate), and enterobacter cloacae (1 isolate). isolates were resistant to most beta-lactams except aztreonam, and variable resistance to carbapenems was observed (mic range, 2 to >8 mg/l). pcr and sequence analysis identified the blaimp-4 gene and a class 1 integrase (inti1) in all isolates. of the 16 patients, 12 (75%) had infection; 5 had septicemia, 5 had ventilator-associated pneumonia, 1 had a urinary tract infection, and 1 had a superficial central venous line infection. six (38%) of the 16 patients died, and 5 of those 6 (31% of the group of 16) had clinical infection with an mbl-producing organism. all except 2 patients had spatio-temporal epidemiological links in the intensive care unit. all k. pneumoniae isolates were of different ribogroups, whereas the s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa isolates were predominately of the same ribogroup. conclusions: mbl-producing gram-negative organisms have now emerged in australia. the resistance gene, blaimp-4, appears highly mobile; this outbreak involved 5 different gram-negative genera from patients with close epidemiological links.

TI  == high prevalence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnra in  multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures in liverpool, uk.
AB  == objectives: to determine the prevalence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance qnra gene in a selected collection of blood culture isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to both ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. methods: over  a 29 month period, a total of 47 non-repetitive isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to both ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime were identified. isolates were screened for the presence of the qnra gene, class i integrons and bla(esbl) by pcr. transferability was examined by conjugation with the sodium azide-resistant  escherichia coli j53. all qnra-positive isolates were examined for dna-relatedness by pfge. results: a total of 15 of the 47 test isolates (32%) were positive for the qnra gene, and included single isolates of e. coli and citrobacter freundii, 4 klebsiella pneumoniae and 9 enterobacter cloacae. all 15  qnra-positive isolates carried class 1 integrons, and 11 the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene bla(shv-12). by pfge two k. pneumoniae and three e. cloacae,  respectively, were considered clonally but not temporally related. plasmid transfer of quinolone resistance was only achieved with single isolates of k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae. both plasmids carried class 1 integrons with a psal-1-like gene cassette arrangement intl1-aada2-qacedelta-sul1. conclusions: in this selected group of ciprofloxacin- and cefotaxime-resistant bacteria, carriage of the qnra gene was high (32%). this compares with <2.0% as demonstrated in worldwide studies of laboratory collections of ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria.  the majority of qnra-positive isolates in our study originated from high-dependency care units within our hospital, but were shown not to be clonal by pfge. this is the first report of qnra-positive enterobacteriaceae in the united kingdom.

TI  == surveillance of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from clinical samples and faecal carriers in barcelona, spain.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present study was to characterize and compare the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing organisms isolated from clinical samples and faecal carriers in 2001 and 2002. methods: a total of 5251 enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical samples and 1321 stool samples were evaluated for the presence of esbls. the stool samples were spread onto plates of macconkey agar containing 2 mg/l cefotaxime for selection of esbl-producing strains. these strains were defined as those showing synergism between amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and third-generation cephalosporins. the beta-lactamases involved were characterized by isoelectric focusing, pcr assays and dna sequencing. results: the prevalence of esbl-producing strains among clinical enterobacteriaceae was 1.7%. of these, 87.6% produced ctx-m, 25.8% produced shv and 2.2% were tem-type-producing strains. all clinical esbl-producing strains were escherichia coli, with the exception of four klebsiella pneumoniae and one citrobacter freundii. the prevalence of faecal carriage of esbl-producing organisms was 3.3%. of these, 75% produced ctx-m-type  enzymes followed by 22.7% shv-producing strains. all faecal esbl-producing strains were e. coli except for one enterobacter cloacae and one proteus mirabilis. this latter strain produced the per-1 enzyme reported for the first time in spain. conclusions: the prevalence of esbl-producing strains in stool samples was higher than that observed in clinical samples from the same period. the different types of esbls found were similar in both contexts. the most prevalent esbls were the ctx-m-related enzymes, with nine different types, followed by shv-12.

TI  == pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the south american bullfrog leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  == norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the south american bullfrog, leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. the primary structure of a  previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as gly-leu-leu-asp-thr-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asn-val-val-gly-ser-leu-ala-ser-lys-v al-met-glu-lys-leu.nh2. the second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the caribbean mountain chicken frog l. fallax. pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b) but potencies were relatively low (mic values in the range 25-200 microm). the peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (ld50>400 microm).

TI  == characterisation of the microflora of attieke, a fermented cassava product, during traditional small-scale preparation.
AB  == attieke is a fermented cassava product consumed mainly in cote d'ivoire. the aim  of this study was to characterise the attieke fermentation by examining products  from 15 small-scale production sites at various stages of its preparation. for the preparation of attieke, fresh cassava is grated to a pulp and inoculated with 10% of a spontaneous traditional inoculum. the inocula contained aerobic mesophiles at mean numbers of 8.2 x 10(7) cfu/g and lactic and acetic acids at mean concentrations of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. the mean ph was 5.0. lactic acid bacteria were the dominant microorganisms in cassava pulp throughout fermentation with the mean numbers being 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/g after 15 h. the identification to the species level of microorganisms from one representative attieke production of good quality showed that, at the start of fermentation, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides was present in the highest numbers, accounting for 20% of all lactic acid bacteria. as the fermentation proceeded, this species was replaced by homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, present at 20% and 16%, respectively, and obligate heterofermentatives, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus confusus at 12% and 10%, respectively,  of total lactic acid bacteria in the flora at the end of fermentation. high numbers of acid-sensitive microorganisms, bacillus circulans, bacillus lentus, enterobacter sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, were transferred to the pulp in the inocula, but acidification to a mean ph of 4.4 with mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.59% and 0.2%, respectively, prevented their growth and reduced their numbers to less than 10(2) cfu/g at the end of fermentation. the mean numbers of candida tropicalis, the main yeast present, remained relatively constant at about 10(5) cfu/g throughout  attieke production. the mean numbers of aerobic mesophiles decreased to below 10(2) cfu/g as a result of the steaming process. the finished attieke had a mean  ph of 4.4 and mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively.

TI  == development of a multiplex pcr and shv melting-curve mutation detection system for detection of some shv and ctx-m beta-lactamases of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae in taiwan.
AB  == infection by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae has been increasing in taiwan. accurate identification of the esbl genes is necessary for surveillance and for epidemiological studies of the mode of transmission in the hospital setting. we describe herein the development of a novel system, which consists of a multiplex pcr to identify bla(shv), bla(ctx-m-3)-like, and bla(ctx-m-14)-like genes and a modified shv melting-curve  mutation detection method to rapidly distinguish six prevalent bla(shv) genes (bla(shv-1), bla(shv-2), bla(shv-2a), bla(shv-5), bla(shv-11), and bla(shv-12)) in taiwan. sixty-five clinical isolates, which had been characterized by nucleotide sequencing of the bla(shv) and bla(ctx-m) genes, were identified by the system. the system was then used to genotype the esbls from 199 clinical isolates, including 40 enterobacter cloacae, 68 escherichia coli, and 91 klebsiella pneumoniae, collected between august 2002 and march 2003. shv-12 (80 isolates) was the most prevalent type of esbl identified, followed in order of frequency by ctx-m-3 (65 isolates) and ctx-m-14 (36 isolates). seventeen (9%) of  the 199 clinical isolates harbored both shv- and ctx-m-type esbls. in contrast to enterobacter cloacae, the majority of which produced shv-type esbls, e. coli and  k. pneumoniae were more likely to possess ctx-m-type esbls. three rare ctx-m types were identified through sequencing of the bla(ctx-m-3)-like (ctx-m-15) and  bla(ctx-m-14)-like (ctx-m-9 and ctx-m-13) genes. the system appears to provide an efficient differentiation of esbls among e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae in taiwan. moreover, the design of the system can be easily adapted for similar purposes in areas where different esbls are prevalent.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == countrywide spread of community- and hospital-acquired extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ctx-m-15)-producing enterobacteriaceae in lebanon.
AB  == a prospective study was carried out to assess the extent of carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae at both hospital and community levels in lebanon. a total of 1,442 fecal samples were collected from hospital-based patients and 58 from health care workers of six lebanese tertiary care general hospitals located in different areas of lebanon between january and march 2003. a total of 382 fecal samples were also collected  from healthy subjects between april and june 2003. the samples analysis led to the identification of 118 strains as esbl producers based on the synergistic effects between clavulanate and selected beta-lactams (ceftazidime and cefotaxime). these strains were isolated from 72 subjects: 61 patients, 2 health  care workers, and 9 healthy subjects. one representative strain per subject was selected, and a total of 72 nonduplicate esbl producers, including a high majority of escherichia coli (n = 56), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 9), enterobacter cloacae (n = 6), and citrobacter freundii (n = 1), were characterized. the molecular analysis revealed that the majority of the strains (83%) express ctx-m-15 esbl (pi 8.6). shv-5a esbl (pi 8.2) was produced by 18% of the strains. dna macrorestriction analysis of esbl-producing e. coli presented 38 different genotypes, revealing the absence of clonal link among these strains. in addition to the fact that the present study highlights the emergence and the countrywide dissemination of ctx-m-15-producing e. coli in lebanon, it represents the first report of an shv-5a-producing c. freundii.

AB  == organisms producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) have been reported  in many countries, but there is no information on the prevalence of esbl-producing members of the family enterobacteriaceae in cameroon. a total of 259 enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated between 1995 and 1998 from patients  at the yaounde central hospital in cameroon. enterobacterial isolates resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporin and monobactam were screened for esbl production by the double-disk (dd) synergy test. thirty-one (12%) of these enterobacteriaceae strains were shown to be positive by the dd synergy test, suggesting the presence of esbls. resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and monobactams of 12 (38.7%) of the 31 strains-i.e., 6 klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 escherichia coli, 1 citrobacter freundii, and 1 enterobacter cloacae strain-was transferred to e. coli hk-225 by conjugation. resistance to gentamicin, gentamicin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was cotransferred into 6, 2, and 1 of these transconjugants, respectively. all 12 transconjugants were resistant to amoxicillin, piperacillin, all of the cephalosporins, and aztreonam but remained susceptible to cefoxitin and imipenem. crude extracts of beta-lactamase-producing transconjugants were able to reduce the diameters of inhibition zones around disks containing penicillins, narrow- to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins or monobactams when tested against a fully susceptible e. coli strain but had no effect on such zones around cefoxitin, imipenem, and amoxicillin-clavulanate disks. the beta-lactamases produced by the  12 tranconjugants turned out to be shv-12 by dna sequencing. therefore, the esbl  shv-12 is described for the first time in cameroon.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2003  and march 2004].
AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from april 2003 to march 2004 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 455 strains including 14 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 191(75.2%) of 254 patients with surgical infections. two hundred and thirty-nine strains were isolated from primary infections, and 216 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria and aerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. among anaerobic  gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, e. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. the isolation rate  of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. in this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant mrsa. carbapenm-resistant p. aeruginosa was seen in less than 10 per cents. last year we noticed that there were cefazolin-resistant e. coli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but there was no highly cefazolin-resistant e. coli in this year. in the next series, increase of both anaerobic bacteria and enterococcus spp. should be carefully followed up.

TI  == accelerating bacterial identification by infrared spectroscopy by employing microarray deposition of microorganisms.
AB  == a microarray method for the deposition of bacteria onto an agar slide was developed to accelerate the formation of microcolonies. representative microarrays each consisting of 40 micro-spots of five replicates of eight foodborne bacteria (yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii,  klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli) were printed on a brain heart infusion (bhi) agar slide using a contact micro-spotting robotic system. within 3 h, sufficient bacterial cells were obtained to allow accurate identification of the microorganism by infrared spectroscopy. this approach allows a "complete-in-a-single-day" analysis of a large array of samples.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli associated with catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated bloodstream infections and hand carriage by healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == objective: bloodstream infections caused by gram-negative bacilli are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in neonatal intensive care units. this study describes the species of gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections in two neonatal intensive care units, compares characteristics of catheter-related and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections, and compares species and antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms with those isolated from the hands of nurses working in the same neonatal intensive care units. design: interventional study. setting: two high-risk neonatal intensive care units. patients: neonates hospitalized for >or  =24 hrs. interventions: prospective surveillance for bloodstream infections was performed in two neonatal intensive care units from march 2001 to january 2003. hand cultures were obtained quarterly from participating nurses immediately after they performed hand hygiene. measurements and main results: there were 298 episodes of bloodstream infections among 2,935 admissions (5.75 episodes per 1,000 patient-days); 77 of 298 (26%) episodes were caused by gram-negative bacilli. among these, 47 (61.0%) were catheter-related bloodstream infections (2.61 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days). eleven and 24 gram-negative bacilli species were isolated from neonates and nurses, respectively. the most common gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections were klebsiella pneumoniae (38.7%), escherichia coli (21.2%), enterobacter cloacae (11.2%), and serratia marcescens (11.2%). in contrast, acinetobacter lwoffi (18.1%), k. pneumoniae (11.7%), e. cloacae (10.6%), k. oxytoca (10.6%), and pseudomonas spp. (7.4%) were most commonly isolated from hands of nurses. e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae,  and e. aerogenes were significantly more likely to cause bloodstream infections than to be isolated from nurses' hands (all p < .001). although 39% of bloodstream infections were non-catheter-related, there were no significant differences in types of organisms or antimicrobial resistance patterns between catheter-related bloodstream infections and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections (all p > or = .35). resistance patterns were similar between gram-negative bacilli isolates from neonates and nurses' hands except for a significantly higher proportion of resistance to cefotaxime and gentamicin among  neonatal isolates of k. pneumoniae (p < .05). conclusions: gram-negative bacilli  species isolated from neonatal bloodstream infections and nurses' hands varied significantly. clean hands of providers are an unlikely source of endemic gram-negative bacilli, suggesting that prevention strategies should focus more on control of endogenous neonatal flora or environmental sources.

TI  == broader distribution of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in the united states.
AB  == the plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance gene qnra confers low-level quinolone resistance, facilitating selection of higher-level resistance. epidemiologic surveys for qnra were extended to isolates of enterobacter spp. and to quinolone-susceptible enterobacteriaceae. two (10%) of 20 ceftazidime-resistant quinolone-susceptible klebsiella pneumoniae strains carried the gene, as did 12 (17%) of 71 ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter strains from across the united states. one of these enterobacter isolates was quinolone susceptible. thus, qnra  is present in quinolone-resistant and quinolone-susceptible enterobacter and klebsiella strains in the united states.

TI  == worldwide disseminated arma aminoglycoside resistance methylase gene is borne by  composite transposon tn1548.
AB  == the arma (aminoglycoside resistance methylase) gene, which confers resistance to  4,6-disubstituted deoxystreptamines and fortimicin, was initially found in klebsiella pneumoniae bm4536 on incl/m plasmid pip1204 of ca. 90 kb which also encodes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ctx-m-3. thirty-four enterobacteria  from various countries that were likely to produce a ctx-m enzyme since they were more resistant to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime were studied. the arma gene was  detected in 12 clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and shigella flexneri, in which it was always associated with bla(ctx-m-3) on an incl/m plasmid. conjugation, analysis of dna sequences, pcr mapping, and plasmid conduction experiments indicated that the arma gene was part of composite transposon tn1548  together with genes ant3"9, sul1, and dfrxii, which are responsible for resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim, respectively. the 16.6-kb genetic element was flanked by two copies of is6 and migrated by replicative transposition. this observation accounts for the presence of arma on self-transferable plasmids of various incompatibility groups and its worldwide dissemination. it thus appears that posttranscriptional modification of 16s rrna confers high-level resistance to all the clinically available aminoglycosides except streptomycin in gram-negative human and animal pathogens.

TI  == distribution of genes encoding the microbial non-oxidative reversible hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases.
AB  == bacterial non-oxidative, reversible multi subunit hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases are encoded by the three clustered genes, b, c, and d, of approximately 0.6, 1.4, and 0.2 kb, respectively. there are more than 160 homologues in the database with significant similarity to gene b (homology to ubix) and c (ubid) distributed in all three microbial domains, however, homologues to gene d, are not numerous ( approximately 15). the occurrence of the entire bcd gene cluster encoding for either identified or presumptive hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase to date has been revealed in sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus (unique genes arrangement cdb), streptomyces sp. d7, bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, e. coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae,  enterobacter cloacae, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella enterica, s. paratyphi, s. typhimurium, s. bongori, and s. diarizonae. the corresponding genes from s. hydroxybenzoicus, b. subtilis, streptomyces sp. d7, e. coli o157:h7, k. pneumoniae, and s. typhimurium were cloned and expressed in e. coli dh5alpha (void of analogous genes), and shown to code for proteins exhibiting non-oxidative hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase activity.

TI  == the effect of electron beam irradiation on the survival of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and psychrotrophic bacteria on raw chicken breasts stored at  four degrees celsius for fourteen days.
AB  == the effect of high-energy electron beam irradiation on the survival of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and psychrotrophic bacteria on commercial chicken breast meat was evaluated. fresh chicken breast meat was purchased from a local poultry processor, inoculated with 8 log10 cfu/ml salmonella, packaged in styrofoam trays and over wrapped with a polyvinyl chloride film, and subjected to 0, 1, 2, or 3 kgy of irradiation. the packaged samples were stored at 4 degrees c and analyzed for salmonella typhimurium and psychrotrophic organisms at 0, 2, 4,  6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 d of storage. direct plating and enrichment methods were used for s. typhimurium analyses. the direct plating method revealed a 4 log reduction in salmonella for chicken breasts inoculated and treated with 1, 2, or  3 kgy of irradiation. psychrotrophic counts were conducted at 7 degrees c for 10  d and 25 degrees c for 5 d to determine the effect of incubation methods on the recovery of psychrotrophic organisms. the enrichment method resulted in the repair of injured salmonella cells and an elevated salmonella typhimurium count for all irradiation dosages when compared with data reported for the direct plating method. in general, psychrotrophic counts increased as storage time increased. however, psychrotrophic counts decreased (p < 0.05) as the irradiation dosage increased.

TI  == bacteremia in patients with hematological malignancies.
AB  == background: an appropriate regimen in the empirical therapy of neutropenic fever  episodes must be individualized at each institution. hospitals have different patterns of microbial isolates and antibiotic resistance that must be taken into  account. the aim of this study was to investigate isolates of bacteremia and their antibiotic susceptibility in patients with hematological malignancies. methods: all positive blood cultures at a medical center in taiwan between 1999 and 2002 from patients with hematological malignancies were evaluated. eleven kinds of antibiotics were tested for antimicrobial activities. the risk factors for mortality were evaluated. results: three hundred seventy-one episodes of bacteremia in 266 patients with hematological malignancies were recorded. gram-negative bacilli (gnb) were still predominant and accounted for 78.2% of isolates, followed by gram-positive cocci for 20.8% of isolates, and anaerobes for 1% of isolates. escherichia coli was the most common isolated organism accounting for 27.5% of gnb isolates. other isolates included klebsiella pneumoniae (19.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), and enterobacter cloacae (10.1%). the most isolated microorganisms were susceptible to cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime or imipenem. age, gnb microorganism and inadequate empirical antibiotics were risk factors. conclusions: we suggest that cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime or imipenem is an ideal empirical therapy.

TI  == evaluation by monte carlo simulation of the pharmacokinetics of two doses of meropenem administered intermittently or as a continuous infusion in healthy volunteers.
AB  == meropenem is a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibacterial agent. in order to optimize levels in plasma relative to the mics, the ideal dose level and dosage regimen need to be determined. the pharmacokinetics of meropenem were studied in  two groups, each comprising eight healthy volunteers who received the following doses: 500 mg as an intravenous infusion over 30 min three times a day (t.i.d.) versus a 250-mg loading dose followed by a 1,500 mg continuous infusion over 24 h for group a and 1,000 mg as an intravenous infusion over 30 min t.i.d. versus a 500-mg loading dose followed by a 3,000-mg continuous infusion over 24 h for group b. meropenem concentrations in plasma and urine were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography with uv detection, respectively. pharmacokinetic calculations were done by use of a two-compartment open model, and the data were extrapolated by monte carlo simulations for 10,000 simulated subjects for pharmacodynamic evaluation. there were no significant differences in total clearance and renal clearance between group a and group b or between the intermittent treatment and the continuous infusion. the analyses of the probability of target attainment by  mic for the high- and low-dose continuous infusions were robust up to mics of 4 mg/liter and 2 mg/liter, respectively. the corresponding values for intermittent  infusions were only 0.5 mg/liter and 0.25 mg/liter. when these observations were  correlated with mics obtained from the mystic database, intermittent infusion results in adequate activity against two of the most common nosocomially acquired pathogens, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. however, against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the evaluation shows a clear advantage of high-dose therapy administered as a continuous infusion. we believe that in the empirical therapy situation, the continuous-infusion mode of administration is most worth the extra efforts. we conclude that clinical trials for evaluation of the continuous infusions of meropenem in critically ill patients are warranted.

TI  == mechanisms of resistance of bacteria causing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == the common causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter spp) are frequently resistant to multiple antibiotic classes. s aureus develops resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics by producing a modified penicillin-binding protein. linezolid resistance arises by way of mutations in the 23s ribosomal subunit. antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacilli usually arises by way of beta-lactamase production, upregulation of efflux pumps, or loss of outer membrane proteins. the ability of bacteria to develop and disseminate new mechanisms of antibiotic resistance may outstrip the availability of new antibiotic classes.

TI  == structure-activity relationship of 6-methylidene penems bearing tricyclic heterocycles as broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitors: crystallographic structures show unexpected binding of 1,4-thiazepine intermediates.
AB  == the design and synthesis of a series of seven tricyclic 6-methylidene penems as novel class a and c serine beta-lactamase inhibitors is described. these compounds proved to be very potent inhibitors of the tem-1 and ampc beta-lactamases and less so against the class b metallo-beta-lactamase ccra. in combination with piperacillin, their in vitro activities enhanced susceptibility  of all class c resistant strains from various bacteria. crystallographic structures of a serine-bound reaction intermediate of 17 with the class a shv-1 and class c gc1 enzymes have been established to resolutions of 2.0 and 1.4 a, respectively, and refined to r-factors equal 0.163 and 0.145. in both beta-lactamases, a seven-membered 1,4-thiazepine ring has formed. the stereogenic c7 atom in the ring has the r configuration in the shv-1 intermediate and has both r and s configurations in the gc1 intermediate. hydrophobic stacking interactions between the tricyclic c7 substituent and a tyrosine side chain, rather than electrostatic or hydrogen bonding by the c3 carboxylic acid group, dominate in both complexes. the formation of the 1,4- thiazepine ring structures  is proposed based on a 7-endo-trig cyclization.

TI  == beta-lactam susceptibilities and prevalence of esbl-producing isolates among more than 5000 european enterobacteriaceae isolates.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility to 15 beta-lactam antibiotics was evaluated using enterobacteriaceae isolated during the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active penicillin against escherichia coli,  proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae (94.9%, 98.3%, 87.4% and 82.9% of isolates susceptible). of the cephalosporins, cefepime was most effective against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae (99.2%, 96.3% and 95.2% of isolates susceptible, respectively) and cefoxitin against klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae (98.6% and 95.6% of isolates susceptible). carbapenems had excellent activity (> or =99.5% of all  isolates). esbl-production was confirmed with the esbl-etest and disk diffusion test in 1.3% of escherichia coli isolates, 18.4% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 12.6%  of klebsiella oxytoca and 5.3% of proteus mirabilis isolates.

TI  == an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog leptodactylus fallax (anura:leptodactylidae).
AB  == a 25 amino-acid-residue, c-terminally alpha-amidated peptide with antimicrobial activity, which has been termed fallaxin, was isolated in high yield from the norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog leptodactylus fallax (anura:leptodactylidae). the amino acid sequence of the peptide (gly-val-val-asp-ile-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asp-ile-ala-gly-his-leu-ala-ser-lys- val-met-asn-lys-leu.nh2) shows structural similarity with members of the ranatuerin-2 family previously isolated from the skins of frogs of the genus rana that are only distantly related to the leptodactylidae. this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that many frog skin antimicrobial peptides are related evolutionarily, having arisen from multiple duplications of an ancestral  gene that existed before the radiation of the different families. fallaxin inhibited the growth of reference strains of gram-negative bacteria (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae) but with relatively low potency (mic> or =20 microm) and was inactive against the gram-positive bacterium (staphylococcus aureus) and the yeast candida albicans. the hemolytic activity of fallaxin was very low (hc50>200 microm). a second peptide, comprising residues (1-22) of fallaxin, was also isolated from the skin  secretions but this component was inactive against the microorganisms tested.

TI  == occurrence of antibiotic-resistant enterobacteria in agricultural foodstuffs.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant bacteria or their corresponding resistance determinants are  known to spread from animals to humans via the food chain. we screened 20 vegetable foods for antibiotic-resistant coliform bacteria and enterococci. isolates were directly selected on antibiotic-containing selective agar (color detection). thirteen "common vegetables" (tomato, mushrooms, salad) possessed 10(4)-10(7) cfu/g vegetable of coliform bacteria including only few antibiotic-resistant variants (0-10(5) cfu/g). all seven sprout samples showed a  some orders of magnitude higher contamination with coliform bacteria (10(7)-10(9) cfu/g) including a remarkable amount of resistant isolates (up to 10(7) cfu/g). multiple resistances (up to 9) in single isolates were more common in sprout isolates. resistant bacteria did not originate from sprout seeds. the most common genera among 92 isolates were: 25 enterobacter spp. (19 e. cloacae), 22 citrobacter spp. (8 c. freundii), and 21 klebsiella spp. (9 k. pneumoniae). most  common resistance phenotypes were: tetracycline (43%), streptomycin (37%), kanamycin (26%), chloramphenicol (29%), co-trimoxazol (9%), and gentamicin (4%).  the four gentamicin-resistant isolates were investigated in molecular details. only three (chloramphenicol) resistant, typical plant-associated enterococci were isolated from overnight enrichment cultures. in conclusion, a contribution of sprouts contaminated with multiresistant, gram-negative enterobacteria to a common gene pool among human commensal and pathogenic bacteria cannot be excluded.

TI  == [development and evaluation of a pcr method for diagnosis of salmonella enteric fever, based on dna sequences of the hila gene].
AB  == typically, diagnosis of enteric fever due to salmonella spp. is by bacterial isolation from blood culture; however, the blood culture method is slow, not always available, and not informative in patients with antibiotic treatment. salmonella spp. uses the hila gene (component of the pathogenicity island i) to invade epithelial cells and produce infection. using the hila gene sequence a pcr test was designed to detect salmonella in blood samples. the sensitivity (s), specificity (sp), positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) of the pcr method were obtained by testing the blood samples from 34 patients with suspected of enteric fever. presence of s. typhi was confirmed by blood culture. blood samples were also tested from 35 patients with infections due to other non-salmonella pathogens, again corroborated by blood culture (klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; serratia marcescens, 5; escherichia coli, 4; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; providencia alcalifaciens, 4; enterobacter cloacae, 4). control samples were obtained from 150 healthy volunteers. the s, sp, ppv and npv for the pcr method were all 100%. the lowest number of colony forming units/ml detected by pcr in blood samples was 10.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == incidence of antibiotic-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter species  in freshwater wetlands.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to assess the incidence of enterobacteriaceae (potential human and animal pathogens) in wetlands. methods: enterobacteriaceae,  selected from the sediments and rhizosphere of wetland plant juncus effusus l., were analysed using classical microbiological methods, api20e, api20ne, fatty acid analyses, and 16s rrna sequencing. assessed virulence factors include antibiotic resistance, presence of plasmids and capsules. results: klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter asburiae, known human pathogens, were identified. k. pneumoniae 16s rrna gene sequence showed the significant hit (e < 0.001) with the unculturable bacteria obtained from faeces of elderly individuals (accession number ab099804) when genbank database was used. ent. asburiae 16s rrna gene sequence showed the significant hit with (e < 0.001) with the unculturable bacteria obtained from the pig gastrointestinal tract (accession number af371852). the rate of antibiotic resistance (<50 microg  ml(-1)) was high for ampicillin and cephalosporins for the most strains (75.7%) yet low (>10 to 20 microg ml(-1)) for kanamycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol for all strains tested. capsules were detected in all investigated strains. pcr detected membrane protein but not chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase. significance and impact of the study: the antibiotic resistance of tested strains and presence of capsules (protect micro-organisms from phagocytosis) suggest that wetland sediments and rhizosphere present a potential reservoirs for enteric human and animal pathogens.

TI  == evaluation of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objective: we aimed to assess the performance of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of various species. methods: organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains comprising enterobacter aerogenes (3), enterobacter cloacae (10), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (26), klebsiella oxytoca (3) and proteus mirabilis (4). also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking esbls, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of ampc enzyme in citrobacter freundii (2), e. aerogenes (3), e. cloacae (3), e. coli (4), hafnia alvei (1) and morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase in k. pneumoniae (3) and e. coli (3) or hyperproduction of k1 enzyme in k. oxytoca (6). results: the microscan mic-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 esbl strains as esbl-positive and 23 of 30 non-esbl strains as esbl-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). false negatives among esbl producers were highest with enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between esbl and ampc beta-lactamases. false-positive classifications occurred in two acinetobacter spp., one e. coli producing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase and two k. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. conclusion: the microscan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for esbl confirmation. however, this test has limitations in detecting esbls in enterobacter spp. and in discriminating esbl-related resistance from the k1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp.

TI  == trends and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens causing bloodstream infections among febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancy.
AB  == background and purpose: the microbiological spectrum in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia has changed over the past several decades in western countries. the growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of the widespread use of antibiotics in medical settings. the aim of  this study was to clarify the trends and antimicrobial resistance among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancies. methods: the characteristics of pathogens causing bloodstream infection isolated from patients with febrile neutropenia who were treated at national taiwan university hospital from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. a total of 1174 pathogens were isolated from 3093 admissions to a hematological ward during  this period. among them, 738 isolates were recovered from patients with febrile neutropenia. results: the majority (93%) of these neutropenic febrile patients had underlying acute leukemia or lymphoma. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 57% of isolated pathogens, followed by gram-positive bacteria (32%), fungi (7%),  and anaerobes (3%). in decreasing frequency, escherichia coli (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), and acinetobacter baumannii (5%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), viridans group streptococci (4%), and staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the major gram-positive pathogens. two-thirds (20/30) of s. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. resistance to cefotaxime was found in 63% of e. cloacae, 13% of k. pneumoniae and 10% of e. coli. overall, 33% of e. coli and 13% of k. pneumoniae were resistant to ciprofloxacin. conclusions: this study indicates that the microbiological spectrum of microorganisms causing  bloodstream infections in neutropenic febrile patients with hematological malignancies at national taiwan university hospital is different from western countries in that gram-negative bacteria remain the predominant pathogens. antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens is high and e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin are increasing.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of the acid-inducible asr gene in enterobacteria.
AB  == we show here that transcription of the asr gene in escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae is strongly dependent on the acidification level of the growth medium, with maximal  induction at ph 4.0-4.5 as determined by northern hybridization analysis. previous gene array analyses have also shown that asr is the most acid-induced gene in the e. coli genome. sequence alignment of the asr promoters from different enterobacterial species identified a highly conserved region located at position -70 to -30 relative to the asr transcriptional start site. by deletion of various segments of this region in the e. coli asr promoter it was shown that  sequences upstream from the -40 position were important for induction. transcription from the e. coli asr promoter was demonstrated to be growth-phase-dependent and to require the alternative sigma factor rpos (sigma(s)) in stationary phase. transcription of the asr gene was also found to be subject to negative control by the nucleoid protein h-ns.

TI  == [epidemiology and drug resistance of the pathogenic microbes in the complicated infection of hematological malignancies].
AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiological characteristics and drug resistance profile of the infection in patients with hematological malignancies. methods: all the microbe strains isolated from the department of hematology in ruijin hospital between 1998 and 2002 were collected for the assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility and the results were analysed by whonet5 software. results: out of the 536 strains isolated in the department of hematology, 230 (42.9%) were gram positive and 301 (56.2%) gram negative organisms. the first 6 strains of gram (-) microbes in frequent order were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas (xantho) maltophi. the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbls)  producing rates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were 27.3% and 33.3%, respectively. methylcillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococcus (mrcns) was the most prevalent gram (+) bacteria in the complicated infection patients with hematological malignancies, which accounted for 88.5%. carbapenems  were most sensitive for all of the gram negative bacteria, with a drug resistance rate of 11.4 (5.0% approximately 15.8%) of imipenem. for esbls strains, carbapenems and cefapime were the best choice, with the resistance rate of 46.4%  approximately 94.4% and 50.0% approximately 75.9%, respectively. the drug resistance rate of acinetobacter baumannii was 25.0% approximately 41.3% for the  third generation cephalosporin, 22.7% for the fourth generation cephalosporin and 12.7% for imipenem. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to carbapenems, with a resistance rate of 12.7% of imipenem; however, it was more sensitive to the third generation cephalosporin. conclusion: antibiotics should be rationally administrated with more considerations to the characteristics of epidemiology and drug resistance profile of the microbes in the given department of hematology.

TI  == use of dna microarrays for rapid genotyping of tem beta-lactamases that confer resistance.
AB  == standard clinical procedures for pathogen resistance identification are laborious and usually require 2 days of cultivation before the resistance can be determined unequivocally. in contrast, clinicians and patients face increasing threats from  antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria in terms of their frequencies and levels of resistance. a major class of microbial resistance stems from the occurrence of beta-lactamases, which, if mutated, can cause the severe extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or inhibitor-resistant tem (irt) phenotype, which cause resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, monobactams, and beta-lactamase inhibitors. we describe an oligonucleotide microarray for identification of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) of 96% of the tem beta-lactamase variants  described to date which are related to the esbl and/or irt phenotype. the target  dna, originating from escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae cells isolated from clinical samples, was amplified and fluorescently  labeled by pcr with consensus primers in the presence of cyanine 5-labeled nucleotides. the total assay, including pcr, hybridization, and image analysis, could be performed in 3.5 h. the microarray results were validated by standard clinical procedures. the microarray outperformed the standard procedures in terms of assay time and the depth of information provided. in conclusion, this array offers an attractive option for the identification and epidemiologic monitoring of tem beta-lactamases in the routine clinical diagnostic laboratory.

AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == molecular epidemiology of gram-negative bacilli from infected neonates and health care workers' hands in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == we sought to characterize the molecular epidemiology of gram-negative bacilli (gnb) causing infections in infants and associated with carriage on nurses' hands after hand hygiene was performed. from march 2001 to january 2003, gnb caused 192 (34%) of 562 hospital-acquired infections in the 2 participating neonatal intensive care units (nicus) and were isolated from the hands of 45 (38%) of 119  nurses. five species--klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter cloacae, all of which were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis--caused 169 (88%) of 192 of gnb infections. overall, 58% of infections were caused by unique strains not cultured from other  infants or nurses, and 31% of infections were part of unrecognized molecular clusters. in contrast, only 9% of strains that caused infections were cultured from nurses' hands. these data suggest that practices in addition to hand hygiene are needed to prevent horizontal transmission of gnb in the nicu.

TI  == resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (uti). during a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. fever higher than 38.5 degrees c was significantly more common in the bacteremic group  than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. e. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic uti than non-bacteremic uti (73% vs 49%; p<0.01).  bacteria other than e. coli (i.e., k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, proteus spp., morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, serratia marcescens, and providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic uti than bacteremic uti (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). e. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). isolates of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and  proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. the emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic uti in taiwan. further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial  resistance on the outcome in these conditions.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == enteric gram-negative bacilli bloodstream infections: 17 years' experience in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to assess the occurrence of enteric gram-negative bacilli (egnb) bloodstream infections (bsi) in a neonatal intensive care setting during a 17-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment program was in place. to document infections, outbreaks, or epidemics, emergence of antibiotic resistance, clinical correlates, and outcomes of the most prevalent egnb (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae). methods: this study analyzed demographic, clinical, and bacteriologic information from 360 infants born 1986-2002 who developed 633 blood culture-proven bsi. a total of 121 egnb were isolated (e coli, k pneumoniae, and e cloacae). early-onset bsi were discovered within 48 hours from birth, and late-onset bsi were those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsi were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, suspected late-onset bsi with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics  were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsi were noted in 52 of 21,336 (244/100,000) live births (1986-1991), 40 of 20,402 (196/100,000) live births (1992-1997), and 25 of 17,926 (139/100,000) live births (1998-2002). of these cases, 39 were caused by e coli and 4 by k pneumoniae. antibiograms for e coli isolated during the last 5 years of the study showed an increase in antibiotic resistance that coincided with obstetric group b streptococcus antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis. group b streptococcus declined from 41 to 4 cases from the first to the last period. late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases from the first to the second 6-year study period and declined modestly (171 cases) during the last. fifteen percent (78 cases) of late-onset bsi were caused by egnb, 5% by other gram-negative bacilli, 67% primarily by coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and 13% by fungus. nonspecific clinical and hematologic signs of late-onset bsi were  similar across egnb species, but necrotizing enterocolitis was often associated with e coli, whereas pneumonia and prolonged thrombocytopenia characterized k pneumoniae infections. no outbreaks or epidemics were observed, and strains of egnb with evidence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were never isolated. conclusion: antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis may have increased antibiotic resistance in e coli isolates from early-onset bsi but has dramatically decreased group b streptococcus infections. late-onset bsi caused by egnb increased, but without changes in antibiotic susceptibility. in spite of medical advances, e coli, k pneumoniae, and e cloacae remain responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, especially in very low birth weight infants.

TI  == evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate esbl etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  == objectives: in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new esbl etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate esbl etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on enterobacter spp. methods: overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=10), escherichia coli (n=10), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and proteus mirabilis (n=3). to check etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to esbl, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of k. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. results: with this panel, esbl etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. concentrating on enterobacter spp., reliable esbl detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed esbl production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. a limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with k1 phenotypes of k. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. conclusion: the new etest esbl strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to  current methods for detection of esbls. in our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of esbls, particularly in enterobacter spp.

AB  == three phenotypic methods for detecting metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) in gram-negative bacilli were tested on 60 mbl producers and 155 mbl nonproducers. the 2-mercaptopropionic acid double-disk potentiation method using ceftazidime and cefepime with and without clavulanate was found to be most sensitive (100%).  the combined disk method depends on comparing the zones given by disks containing a beta-lactam with and without ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. various drug combinations were tested, and the best results were obtained with imipenem for pseudomonas species and acinetobacter baumannii, ceftazidime-clavulanate for klebsiella pneumoniae, and cefepime-clavulanate for enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii. the overall sensitivity of the combined disk method was 86.7%. the etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) method using imipenem- ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid strips detected imipenem-resistant mbl-producing  isolates only, resulting in a sensitivity of 36.7%. our data suggest that the double-disk and combined disk tests are acceptable methods for mbl detection in both imipenem-resistant and imipenem-susceptible isolates.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis after cranial surgery or trauma in adults.
AB  == in order to assess the clinical features, aetiology, treatment and outcome of post-neurosurgical and post-traumatic gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) we performed a retrospective review of all adult patients admitted to the department of neurosurgery who had gram-negative bacilli cultured from cerebrospinal fluid (csf) following a neurosurgical procedure or traumatic head/spinal injury. during the 12 y of the review 33 patients had csf isolates of gram-negative bacilli that were thought to be significant. the median patient age was 47 y (range 22-77 y) and 21 (64%) were male. klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli were the most common isolates. minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic) measured for half the patients' isolates resulted in 5 regimen changes, including 2 patients with e. cloacae meningitis in whom cephalosporin susceptibility decreased during cephalosporin treatment. our recommended initial treatment was intravenous ceftriaxone and amikacin, subsequently tailored by susceptibility results; approximately half the patients  remained on the antibiotics they started and half were changed to an alternate regimen, most often a carbapenem. five patients (15%) died, 1 dying after cure of his gnbm. there were no failures in those who received more than 12 d of appropriate treatment: treatment for at least 14 d after the last positive csf culture guaranteed cure. initial ceftriaxone and amikacin subsequently changing to susceptibility driven alternatives, often a carbapenem, resulted in cure of 85% of our patients with gnbm.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

AB  == standard microbiological tests (i.e., mic) do not account for the unique factors  of peritoneal dialysis (pd)-related peritonitis which can significantly influence treatment response. our goals were to develop a peritoneal fluid titer (pft) test and to conduct a pilot study of its association with clinical outcome. the methodology was developed by using spent dialysate collected from patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis prior to the initiation of antibiotics. dialysate was processed and spiked with antibiotic to simulate two standard intraperitoneal regimens: cefazolin plus tobramycin and cefazolin alone. thirty-six clinical isolates, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested. in the pilot study, dialysate was collected from 14 patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis. titers were determined by using each patient's dialysate and infecting pathogen. titers were  highly reproducible, with discrepancies in only 1% of cases. overall, pfts were notably higher against gram-positive bacteria (p < 0.0001). the addition of tobramycin increased titers significantly from zero to values of 1/16 to 1/64 against e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa (p < 0.0001). in the pilot study, peritoneal fluid inhibitory titers were significantly associated with clinical outcome, with a median value of 1/96 for patients who were cured compared to 1/32 for those who failed treatment (p = 0.036). in conclusion, this study provides preliminary support for the pft as a pharmacodynamic index specific to the treatment of pd-related peritonitis. with further characterization and validation in patients, the pft test may advance the study of antibiotic therapies for pd-related peritonitis.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by u.s. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  == background: bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. the widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (cns) pathogens is important to define current prevalence  of resistance. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from cns specimens was analyzed using the surveillance database (tsn) usa database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 us hospital laboratories. a total of 6029 organisms derived from cns specimen sources during  2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. results: staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. the modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. prevalence of mrsa among s. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for s. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for s. agalactiae. for csf isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was s. pneumoniae (3.5%), e. coli (0.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), serratia marcescens (5.6%), enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), haemophilus influenzae (0%). listeria monocytogenes and n. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. conclusions: resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. this data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat cns infections.

TI  == a family of brevinin-2 peptides with potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa from the skin of the hokkaido frog, rana pirica.
AB  == nine peptides displaying varying degrees of antimicrobial activity were extracted from the skin of the hokkaido frog, rana pirica. five structurally related peptides were identified as members of the brevinin-2 family. these peptides were active against reference strains of gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae) and gram-positive (staphlococcus aureus) bacteria but displayed relatively low hemolytic activity.  the most abundant peptide, brevinin-2pra (680 nmol/g weight of dry skin) showed high potency [minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values between 6 and 12 microm] against a range of clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa. in addition, activity was unaffected by nacl concentrations up to 200 mm. cladistic analysis based on the primary structures of brevinin-2 peptides supports a close phylogenetic relationship between r. pirica and japanese mountain brown frog rana ornativentris. one peptide of the ranatuerin-2 family and one strongly hemolytic  peptide of the brevinin-1 family were also isolated from the extract along with two members of the temporin family, temporin-1pra (ilpilgnllngll.nh(2)) and temporin-1prb (ilpilgnllnsll.nh(2)) that atypically lacked basic amino acid residues and showed only very weak antimicrobial and hemolytic activity.

AB  == background: a microbial detection system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux [formerly organon teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in plts. the recovery of nine organisms seeded into plts with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. the use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis plt  units to 10 and 100 cfus per ml. replicate samples (4 ml) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. results: all organisms (with the exception of p. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 cfus/ml). in aggregate (with the exception of p. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). in all cases,  the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. p. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with  the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 cfus/ml), respectively. the narrower bottle  neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. conclusions: these data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.

TI  == oral bacterial flora of dogs with and without rabies: a preliminary study in thailand.
AB  == the authors studied the bacterial flora of the dog oral cavity and of bite wounds, aerobic bacteria were isolated from mouth swabs of 16 normal and 5 rabid  dogs as well as from infected dog-bite wounds from 18 patients. a total of 20 different microbial species were recovered from mouth swab cultures. the most frequently isolated organisms were klebsiella pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pasteurella species. there were no differences in the aerobic bacterial flora between rabid and nonrabid dogs. from  the cultures of the bite wound swabs, the authors found that almost all of the organisms identified were part of the normal oral flora of the dog. one or more aerobic bacteria were isolated from the infected dog-bite wounds. two patients had four, 3 had three, 4 had two, and 6 had one of the nine organisms in their wounds. the predominant species of bacteria involved in infection of bite wounds  were, as follows: staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, moraxella species, pasteurella canis, and enterobacter cloacae. however, three wound cultures had no aerobic bacterial growth. the results of this study show that the infected bite wounds may contain a mixed bacterial flora that colonize human skin and the oral cavity of dogs.

TI  == increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in korea: konsar study in 2001.
AB  == the 5th year konsar surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. it was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. resistance rates of gram-positive cocci were: 70% of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. seventy-two percent of pneumococci were  nonsusceptible to penicillin. the resistance rates of enterobacteriaceae were: escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. with the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem against enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == study objective: to compare the pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem, both  administered as 500 mg every 6 hours, against populations of enterobacteriaceae,  acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. design: ten thousand-subject monte carlo simulation. intervention: variability in total body clearance (clt),  volume of distribution as calculated by the terminal elimination rate (vdbeta), and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) distributions (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, a. baumannii, p. aeruginosa) were derived from the literature for both meropenem and imipenem.  for the free drug concentrations, the percentage of the dosing interval that the  drug concentrations remain above the mic (%t>mic) for each carbapenem-bacteria combination was calculated for 10,000 iterations, substituting a different clt, vdbeta, fraction of unbound drug, and mic into the equation each time based on the probability distribution for each parameter. probabilities of attaining targets of 30%, 50%, and 100% t>mic were calculated. measurements and main results: meropenem free drug %t>mic exposure was significantly greater than that  of imipenem against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, whereas imipenem exposure was greater for a. baumannii. for both agents, free drug %t>mic exposure was greatest against enterobacteriaceae and less for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. probabilities of target attainment for 30% and 50% t>mic were similar between drugs for most bacteria. at 100% t>mic, meropenem target attainments were greater than those of imipenem against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, and  imipenem attainment was higher for a. baumannii. conclusion: the probability of attaining lower pharmacodynamic targets for most gram-negative bacteria is similar for these carbapenems; however, differences become apparent as the pharmacodynamic requirement increases. further study of the benefits of achieving this pharmacodynamic breakpoint with a higher probability of attaining targets is necessary.

TI  == microbiological contamination of enteral feeding solutions used in costa rican hospitals.
AB  == enteral feeding is the most common and preferred modality for providing nutritional support to hospital patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract that can not satisfy their nutritional requirements. nevertheless, enteral feeding may be an important cause of bacterial infection. the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial contamination level of enteral feedings distributed in costa rican hospitals. a total of 124 samples of enteral feeding, coming from  five different hospitals from san jose, costa rica, were evaluated during the second semester of 1997 and first of 1998 for the presence and identification of  total and fecal coliforms, pseudomonas sp. and listeria sp. a subpopulation of the pseudomonas isolated was analyzed for their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the concentration of gram negative rods in the samples of enteral feeding solutions ranged from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml, markedly exceeding the permissible level (10(2) cfu/ml or less). the coliforms most frequently isolated  included enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coil, serratia sp. and klebsiella pneumoniae. pseudomonas sp. was isolated in more than 70% of the samples made from commercial based solutions, fruits and vegetables. p. aeruginosa and p. fluorescens were the species most frequently isolated. listeria sp. was not isolated from enteral solutions samples. the results obtained demonstrate that it is urgent to assure strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feed in order to avoid bacterial growth. the implementation of haccp (hazard analysis and critical control points) system will be required in a near future for better quality control of enteral nutrition mixtures.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == a molecular phylogeny for seven taxa of enteric bacteria (citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia plymuthica) was made from multiple isolates per taxa taken from a collection of environmental enteric bacteria. sequences from five housekeeping genes (gapa, groel, gyra, ompa, and pgi) and the 16s rrna  gene were used to infer individual gene trees and were concatenated to infer a composite molecular phylogeny for the species. the isolates from each taxa formed tight species clusters in the individual gene trees, suggesting the existence of  'genotypic' clusters that correspond to traditional species designations. these sequence data and the resulting gene trees and consensus tree provide the first data set with which to assess the utility of the recently proposed core genome hypothesis (cgh). the cgh provides a genetically based approach to applying the biological species concept to bacteria.

TI  == confirmation of escherichia coli and its distinction from klebsiella species by gas and indole formation at 44 and 44.5 degrees c.
AB  == aims: in the enumeration of coliform bacteria, confirmation of escherichia coli has been based upon gas and indole production at the elevated incubation temperature. the test for gas production has recently been questioned. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of gas production test on the reliability of confirmation of e. coli. methods and results: the impact of several media on growth, gas and/or indole formation was tested at 44 and 44.5 degrees c using 547 environmental isolates. these were mainly e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae strains. another set of 250 faecal and environmental klebsiellae were tested for their maximum temperature for growth (tmax) and for gas formation. escherichia coli and even k. pneumoniae  grew well in all the media, but gas production was more dependent on the medium used. growth of the mainly gas negative ent. cloacae and k. oxytoca strains was still more sensitive to the medium and incubation conditions. tryptophan salt broth was the most productive medium for the indole test, followed by lauryl tryptose mannitole and tryptone mannitol ricinoleate broth (trm). tmax of k. oxytoca was clearly lower than tmax of k. pneumoniae but a rather high fraction of its isolates produced indole at 44.5 degrees c. conclusions: false-positive e. coli confirmation is possible if gas production is not tested for and the confirmation is based on indole test only. significance and impact of the study:  erroneous positive results on routine analysis for e. coli can occur.

TI  == a new alginate-based rapid method for determining coliforms in milk.
AB  == a new rapid method for monitoring coliforms was developed on the basis of the instant gelling effects of alginate and calcium. the effectiveness of this new method in the detection of coliforms was evaluated. tests involving escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, total coliforms in milk, cold-injured coliforms, and total coliforms in raw milk were carried out. the bacterial samples were diluted in 0.2% peptone water containing 90 mm cacl2 and added into test tubes containing modified purple broth base medium. coliform concentrations were determined on the basis of the time of color change and gas production in the alginate tubes. all results obtained by the alginate method correlated strongly with those obtained by the conventional violet red bile agar  (vrba) plating method. the alginate method reduced detection time by 12 to 14 h compared with the conventional vrba plating method. the alginate method can be applied in field studies more easily than melted-agar systems can. the results of this study indicate that the alginate method is an accurate, rapid, simple, and economical way to monitor and estimate concentrations of total coliforms in food.

AB  == we report here the use of immunomagnetic (im) electrochemiluminescence (ecl) for  quantitative detection of esherichia coli o157:h7 in water samples following enrichment in minimal lactose broth (mlb). im beads prepared in-house with four commercial anti-o157 monoclonal antibodies were compared for efficiency of cell capture. im-ecl responses for e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were similar for  all four commercial anti-o157 lps monoclonal antibodies. the ecl signal was linearly correlated with e. coli o157:h7 cell concentration, indicating a constant ecl response per cell. twenty-two strains of e. coli o157:h7 or o157:nm  gave comparable ecl signals using im beads prepared in-house. to assess the potential for interference from background bacteria in mlb-enriched water samples, 10(4) cells of e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were added to enriched  samples prior to analysis. there was considerable variability in recovery of e. coli o157:h7 cells; net ecl signals ranged from 1% to 100% of expected values (i.e., percent inhibition from 0% to 99%). cultures of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and enterobacter cloacae, subsequently isolated from mlb-enriched water samples via im separation (ims), were observed to interfere with the binding of e. coli o157:h7 cells to im beads. recoveries of 10(4) e. coli o157:h7 cells were </=10% in the presence of ca. 10(8) k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, or e. cloacae cells. none of these strains gave a positive im-ecl signal. although competitive binding decreased sensitivity, there still was a linear correlation between ecl signal and higher e. coli o157:h7 cell concentrations. these studies indicate that im-ecl in conjunction with mlb enrichment is capable of quantitatively detecting as few as 10(3) to 10(5) e. coli o157:h7 cells ml(-1), depending on percent recoveries, in enriched samples that contain ca. 10(9) total lactose-fermenting bacteria ml(-1). assuming comparable growth rates for e. coli o157:h7 and other lactose-fermenting bacteria in mlb, it may be possible to detect as few as one e. coli o157:h7 in 100 ml of raw water containing as many as 10(4) to 10(6) lactose-fermenting bacteria (i.e., total coliforms).

TI  == intestinal microflora in early infancy: composition and development.
AB  == the neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. this enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media.  the limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. the establishment of the gut microbial  population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. the climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. the foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. the maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. the bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. after the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. in full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces  the development of a flora rich in bifidobacterium spp. other obligate anaerobes, such as clostridium spp. and bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also  enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. during the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to  bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a "bifidus flora" is unusual. in other studies the presence of a consistent number  of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. the predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. according to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. in these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of  bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. in extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. the gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified. according to the few studies so far performed, the predominant species are enterococcus faecalis, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. hygienic conditions and antimicrobial procedures strongly influence the intestinal colonization pattern.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == the biological activity of antibacterial substance produced by enterobacter cloacae b8.
AB  == an antibacterial substance was extracted and purified from the culture of enterobacter cloacae b8 and the antagonistic activities of the extract to 229 clinical pathogen strains was tested by the k-b paper-dish method. the extract of enterobacter cloacae b8 showed strongly antagonistic activity to all 146 tested stains of staphylococcus spp.; the antagonistic diameter was about 18-32 mm, averaging about 26.5 mm; showing especially strong antagonistic activity to all 87 tested strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the average antagonistic diameter was about 22.6 mm. the average antagonistic diameter of the extract of enterobacter cloacae b8 to 3 tested strains of escherchia coli and 8 tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae was about 14 mm and 13 mm, respectively; showing only antagonistic activities to 3 strains of acinetobacter spp. in 26 tested strains, and showing no antagonistic activities to all 25 tested strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of partially purified extract against mrsa was about 9.4 micrograms/ml determined by disc-diffusion method, and the mic of vancomycin was  about 3.1 micrograms/ml as the control in this study.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four european countries, canada, and the united states in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  == access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. the present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in europe (france, germany, italy, and spain), canada, and the united states to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. all but two isolates of enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of proteus mirabilis from france and one isolate of morganella morganii from canada) were susceptible to imipenem. the susceptibility of escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for p. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except italy. in contrast, susceptibility  of e. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (spain) to 94.0% (france); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (spain) to 91.6% (united states). among klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of serratia marcescens and m. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. for s. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (france) to 94.1% (italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (germany) to 90.7%  (spain). enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of enterobacteriaceae studied. the present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro  activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == identification of enterobacter bacteria as saxitoxin producers in cattle's rumen  and surface water from venezuelan savannahs.
AB  == we have previously shown that a paralytic toxin able to block sodium channels in  nerve is associated with a cattle disease known as bovine paraplegic syndrome (bps) [toxicon. 31 (1993) 1581]. we have now identified this as saxitoxin (stx) using hplc by either the methods of [toxicon. 31 (1993) 1581], or [toxicon. 25 (1987) 1105]. in recent experiments we were able to collect and cultivate facultative anaerobic bacteria growing on rumen, grass and ponds of corrals with  high incidence of bps; the cultured bacteria produce compounds indistinguishable  from stx under both hplc procedures described above. two species of the enterobacter genus (e. asburiae and e. cloacae) and a strain of klebsiella pneumoniae, were identified using standard biochemical criteria as well as gas chromatography of bacterial lipids. all these bacteria produced stx in aerobic cultures.

TI  == beta-lactamase stability of faropenem.
AB  == faropenem (far) is an orally available member of the penem class unique among carbapenems and other available beta-lactams. this study compared far to cephalosporins and imipenem with respect to beta-lactamase (bla) stability and emergence of resistance to staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. bla stability was studied using enzyme preparations from sonicated/centrifuged 24-hour cultures of e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, providencia  rettgeri, klebsiella pneumoniae, s. aureus, and bacteroides fragilis grown in the presence of 20 mg/l ampicillin or cephaloridine to induce penicillinase or cephalosporinase, respectively. substrate hydrolysis was quantitated spectrophotometrically. multistep acquisition of resistance was promoted by growing bacteria in broth containing 2-fold dilutions of antibiotic over 10 cycles. aliquots from test tubes with visible growth provided the inoculum for the next series of dilutions. far as well as other cephalosporins tested were highly stable to penicillinase derived from s. aureus and e. coli. however, e. coli- and p. vulgaris-derived cephalosporinase hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefaclor and cefotiam considerably, whereas far was highly stable. far was highly stable against hydrolysis by various blas prepared from four b. fragilis strains and the rate of far hydrolysis by metallo-bla was 5 times lower than that for imipenem. additionally, the acquisition of resistant s. aureus strains was less pronounced  for far compared to other agents tested. mics rose 8-fold after the 10th sub-mic  exposure, while mics rose 16-, 31- and 512-fold for cefixime, cefazolin and cefaclor, respectively. e. coli shifts in mics were moderate for all the agents tested. in conclusion, far is characterized by pronounced bla stability compared  to other cephalosporins and imipenem. furthermore, a lower propensity for resistance development with far as compared to cephalosporins was observed.

TI  == contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the united states.
AB  == grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. a total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae (mic(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). for pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (mic(90),  2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (mic(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. none of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same mic(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae. grepafloxacin was very active against haemophilus influenzae (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and legionella spp. (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). these results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in buenos aires, argentina, public hospitals.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). in order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of esbls in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from april to may 2000. extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. from a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards' screening and confirmatory tests for esbl production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and pcr amplification using specific primers. three different esbls were detected: shv-related (4 isolates), per-2-type (9 isolates), and ctx-m-2-related (26 isolates). sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed ctx-m-2 in 19 of 21 and ctx-m-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. ctx-m-2 (or its variant) was detected in all escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and providencia stuartii strains, while per-2 was detected in enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae; shv-related esbl were found only in k. pneumoniae. these results clearly show that ctx-m-2 is the most prevalent esbl produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in buenos aires.

AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in esrd and removal by the cellulose acetate high performance-210 hemodialyzer.
AB  == background: no published data are available describing the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd). objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of levofloxacin and develop dosing strategies in these patients. methods: eight noninfected subjects receiving long-term thrice-weekly hemodialysis, with no measurable residual renal function, were administered intravenous levofloxacin, 250 mg, over 1 hour after a scheduled hemodialysis session. blood samples were collected serially during the interdialytic period, during the next intradialytic period, and immediately after the next hemodialysis session. serum concentrations of levofloxacin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fit to each individual subject's serum concentration-time data by iterative nonlinear weighted least-squares regression  analysis using adapt ii (biomedical simulations resource, university of southern  california, los angeles, ca). ratios of maximum serum concentration (c(max)) to minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were calculated for common respiratory pathogens by using mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) data from published studies. results: all subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. median systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, elimination half-life, and c(max) were 37.0 ml/min (range, 12.8 to 42.7 ml/min), 103.3 l (range, 39.8 to 139.3 l), 34.4 hours (range, 28.4 to 39.3 hours), and 5.2 microg/ml (range, 4.1 to 11.3 microg/ml), respectively. median dialytic clearance and levofloxacin reduction ratios were 84.4 ml/min (range, 61.8 to 107.6 ml/min)  and 0.244 (range, 0.181 to 0.412), respectively. median c(max)-mic90 ratios were  10 or greater for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae, approximately 5 for streptococcus pneumoniae, and less than 1 for pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: the administration of levofloxacin to patients with esrd as 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every  48 hours, will provide adequate c(max)-mic ratios after the first and subsequent  doses for most patients with respiratory tract infections caused by organisms with levofloxacin mics of 1 microg/ml or less.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

AB  == organisms producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) have been reported  in many countries, but there is no information on the prevalence of esbl-producing members of the family enterobacteriaceae in ireland. a total of 925 isolates of ampicillin-resistant members of the enterobacteriaceae were received from six hospitals in ireland over a 3-year period from september 1996 to september 1999. isolates were screened for esbl production by the double-disk  diffusion (ddd) method. ddd-positive isolates that were (i) confirmed as esbl producers by national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) confirmatory testing and (ii) susceptible to cefoxitin by disk diffusion were considered esbl producers. by these criteria, 27 (3%) of the ampicillin-resistant members of the enterobacteriaceae studied were categorized as esbl producers. molecular typing suggested that some intra- and interhospital spread of esbl-producing isolates had occurred. dna sequencing of amplified bla(tem) and bla(shv) genes resulted in the detection of a novel bla(tem) esbl gene, bla(tem-102) in two isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) received from the same hospital but isolated from different patients. the study suggests dissemination of esbl-producing bacteria within the health care system in ireland and emphasizes the need for measures to control such spread.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

AB  == eighteen enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 16 of them with well-defined beta-lactam resistance mechanisms, were sent to 52 spanish microbiology laboratories. interpretative categories for 8 extended-spectrum beta-lactams were collected. participating laboratories used their own routine susceptibility testing procedures (88% automatic systems, 10% disk diffusion, and 2% agar dilution). control results were established by two independent reference  laboratories by applying the nccls microdilution method and interpretative criteria. interpretative discrepancies were observed in 16% of the results (4.4%  for cefepime, 3.0% for aztreonam, 2.8% for piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.7% for cefotaxime [ctx] and ceftazidime, 1.1% for ceftriaxone, 0.9% for meropenem, and 0.3% for imipenem). high consistency with reference values (<5% of major plus very major errors) was observed with (i) american type culture collection quality control strains; (ii) strains with low-efficiency mechanisms inactivating extended-spectrum beta-lactams, such as oxa-1-producing escherichiacoli or shv-1-hyperproducing klebsiella pneumoniae; (iii) strains with highly efficient mechanisms, such as shv-5 porin-deficient k. pneumoniae, ctx-m-10 in enterobacter cloacae hyperproducing ampc, and p. aeruginosa with the mexab oprm efflux phenotype or hyperproducing ampc. low consistency (>30% major plus very major errors) was detected in k1-producing klebsiella oxytoca, ctx-m-9-producing e. coli, and in oprd(-) p. aeruginosa strains. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains accounted for 86% of very major errors. recognition of the esbl phenotype was particularly low in enterobacter cloacae strains (<35%), due to the lack of nccls-specific rules in this genus. a k1-producing k. oxytoca  was misidentified by 10% of laboratories as an esbl producer. the use of well-defined resistant strains is useful for improving proficiency in susceptibility testing in clinical laboratories.

AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == factors influencing gene expression and resistance for gram-negative organisms expressing plasmid-encoded ampc genes of enterobacter origin.
AB  == high-level expression of ampc beta-lactamases results in organisms resistant to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics. the mechanism of chromosomally mediated ampc resistance has been elucidated, however the mechanism(s) driving plasmid-encoded  ampc resistance are unknown. studies were designed to identify factors which influence expression of plasmid-encoded ampc genes and correlate these factors with resistance. as the model system, ampc genes of enterobacter origin were used to determine how gene copy number, genetic background and genetic organization influenced resistance phenotypes. to this end, gene expression from the plasmid-encoded inducible blaact-1 and non-inducible blamir-1 were compared with  chromosomal ampc gene expression from both wild-type (wt) and derepressed enterobacter cloacae isolates. rna levels within the original clinical isolates were examined using primer extension analysis, whereas a new pcr strategy was developed to examine gene copy number. these data revealed that blaact-1 and blamir-1 constitutive expression was 33- and 95-fold higher than wt expression, whereas copy numbers of the plasmid-encoded genes were 2 and 12, respectively. differences in promoters and transcriptional starts for the respective plasmid-encoded genes were noted and contribute to increases observed in overall  expression. finally, beta-lactam mics were increased two- to 16-fold when blaact-1 was expressed in escherichia coli ampd- strains compared with e. coli ampd+ strains. in conclusion, high-level expression of plasmid-encoded ampc genes requires interplay between multiple factors including genetic organization, promoter modifications, genetic background, and to some extent gene copy number.  in addition, clinical laboratories need to be aware that genetic backgrounds of inducible plasmid-encoded genes can dramatically influence mics for organisms not normally associated with derepressed phenotypes.

TI  == [human cowpox/catpox infection. a potentially unrecognized disease].
AB  == history and admission findings: a 36-year-old woman initially noticed a red spot, about pea-sized, with a central pimple over the right eyebrow and a swollen submandibular lymph node. a pressure-sensitive, 4 cm large, node developed out of this small spot, with a central, black, tightly-adhering crust bearing several varioliform vesicles around its edge. in addition to swelling of the right half of the face, the patient had a fever up to 39.5 degrees c, general malaise, nausea and vomiting. various antibiotics were ineffective. the woman was hospitalized with a diagnosis of facial erysipelas. she owned a cat which had developed a purulent nodule on a forepaw a few days before onset of the patient's disease. laboratory test: esr and crp were moderately elevated, no leukocytosis and blood cultures were sterile. wound smears showed colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. diagnosis, treatment and course: the patient's general condition improved under initially calculated antibiotic dosages, which was later adapted to the measured resistance. the black-crusted nodes became larger, however, and incision was performed on the 8 th day after hospitalization, under the suspicion of fluctuation. however, no pus was removed, but there was massive inflammatory infiltration of the soft tissue. examination of samples of skin and part of the crust revealed orthopox virus (cowpox virus).  spontaneous healing followed within 3 weeks, leaving only a small scar. conclusions: this was a cowpox virus in the sense of a zoonosis transmitted by the cat. in germany, now that smallpox has been eradicated, the clinical presentation of infections with the orthopox virus, which are closely related to  variola virus, are too little recognized. atopic and immunocompromised patients are at risk of a cutaneous dissemination with a more severe course of the infectious illness; even a lethal outcome has been reported in germany.

AB  == the aim of this study was to research the distribution in the kinki region of japan of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) and metallo beta-lactamase (mbl). one thousand isolates, 200 of each of four enterobacterial species (i.e. escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens) and 200 of p. aeruginosa, were collected from seven different laboratories during two 2 month periods, one in 1998 and one in 2000. a double-disc synergy test (ddst) and 2-mercaptopropionic acid inhibition test (2-mpat) were used to confirm beta-lactamase-producing isolates. the ddst was positive for one isolate of e. coli, five of k. pneumoniae, two of e. cloacae and 14 of s. marcescens. the 2-mpat was positive for five isolates of s. marcescens and two of p. aeruginosa.  we identified the beta-lactamase type of each isolate by molecular confirmatory tests (isoelectric focusing, pcr and dna sequencing): ctx-m-3 esbls (three isolates of k. pneumoniae, two of e. cloacae and 13 of s. marcescens), ctx-m-2 esbl (one isolate of k. pneumoniae), shv-12 esbls (one isolate of e. coli and one of s. marcescens), ctx-m-3 and shv-12 combination esbl (one isolate of k. pneumoniae) and imp-1 mbls (five isolates of s. marcescens and two of p. aeruginosa). in conclusion, many species of gram-negative bacilli that produce ctx-m-3 esbls and imp-1 mbls were disseminated widely in different hospitals of the kinki region of japan. therefore, monitoring of laboratory bacterial ecology  seems important to stop the spread of these strains through nosocomial outbreaks.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

AB  == although the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) by klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli is an emerging problem, limited data are available regarding the frequency of esbl production in other organisms. we provide the only description of regional occurrence of shv-7 in enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli or k. pneumoniae in the united states, and  we emphasize that, among enterobacter cloacae strains, not all resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is the result of hyperproduction of ampc beta-lactamase.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of bacterial organisms isolated from rats.
AB  == objective: to determine if antimicrobial resistance occurs in various bacterial species isolated from rats. method: two hundred and fifteen rats were trapped from areas in and around nairobi, kenya. they were sacrificed and their intestinal, liver and spleen specimens obtained. various bacterial species were isolated from these specimens. the species were analysed for antimicrobial susceptibility to 12 commonly used antimicrobials using the disc diffusion technique. results: the bacterial species isolated included pathogenic and potentially pathogenic ones such as escherichia coli 137, salmonella typhimurium  1, klebsiella pneumoniae 2, enterobacter cloacae 4, enterobacter sakazakii 2, citrobacter freundii 3, morganella morganii (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 and burkhoddria cepacia 6. depending on the species, the resistance to the various antimicrobials were: 0-100% for cefotaxime, nalidixic acid, cefuroxime, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, co-amoxyclav, sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, trimethoprim and cephradine, 0-66.6% for gentamicin and 0-25% for apramycin. conclusion: the results showed that, rats from the study area harboured bacterial species with antimicrobial resistance. these micro-organisms may form an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance which could pose a public health hazard. control of rat populations, better management of sewer systems and waste  dumping sites are recommended in order to reduce occurrence of these drug resistance reservoirs.

TI  == emerging fluoroquinolone-resistance for common clinically important gram-negative bacteria in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the three most commonly used fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was measured for 2235 isolates of seven common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. collected from a major teaching hospital in taiwan during the years 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1996-97, the samples were evaluated using the agar dilution method. the overall susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has decreased rapidly after the wide use of these antimicrobial agents. isolates of escherichia coli and morganella morganii  proved quite susceptible to the fluoroquinolones until 1996. by 1996-97, 20% of the bacteria had become resistant to the fluoroquinolones. activity against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis remained excellent, however, with more than 90% of the isolates susceptible during the survey period. interestingly, some strains of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrating in vitro resistance even before the fluoroquinolones were launched in taiwan. this resistance increased rapidly, with around 20-30% of s. marcescens isolates fluoroquinolone-resistant by 1996-1997. after the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, resistance was demonstrated for about 15% of the p. aeruginosa isolates, and 20% of enterobacter cloacae isolates, with the susceptibility rate remaining steady state through the 1990s. different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns have been demonstrated for most fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting that the increased resistance was  not due to the spread of a single clone. we conclude a trend of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance for many common gram-negative bacteria in taiwan, especially in recent years. appropriate use of the new fluoroquinolones should be encouraged in order to prevent the rapid emergence and increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria.

TI  == emerging carbapenemases in gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == carbapenemases may be defined as beta-lactamases that significantly hydrolyze at  least imipenem or/and meropenem. carbapenemases involved in acquired resistance are of ambler molecular classes a, b, and d. class a, clavulanic acid-inhibited carbapenemases are rare. they are either chromosomally encoded (nmc-a, sme-1 to sme-3, imi-1) in enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, or plasmid encoded, such as kpc-1 in klebsiella pneumoniae and ges-2 in pseudomonas aeruginosa, the latter being a point-mutant of the clavulanic acid-inhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ges-1. the class b enzymes are the most clinically significant carbapenemases. they are metalloenzymes of the imp or vim  series. they have been reported worldwide but mostly from south east asia and europe. metalloenzymes, whose genes are plasmid and integron located, hydrolyze virtually all beta-lactams except aztreonam. finally, the class d carbapenemases  are increasingly reported in acinetobacter baumannii but compromise imipenem and  meropenem susceptibility only marginally. the sources of the acquired carbapenemase genes remain unknown, as does the relative importance of the spread of epidemic strains as opposed to the spread of plasmid- or integron-borne genes. because most of these carbapenemases confer only reduced susceptibility to carbapenems in enterobacteriaceae, they may remain underestimated as a consequence of the lack of their detection.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == development of a sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting and quantifying cmy-2 and shv beta-lactamases.
AB  == polyclonal rabbit antibodies against shv-1 and cmy-2 beta-lactamases were produced and characterized, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were  developed. immunoblots revealed that the anti-shv-1 antibody recognized shv-1 but did not recognize tem-1, k-1, oxa-1, or any ampc beta-lactamase tested. the anti-cmy-2 antibody detected escherichia coli cmy-2, enterobacter cloacae p99, klebsiella pneumoniae act-1, and the ampc beta-lactamases of enterobacter aerogenes, morganella morganii, and citrobacter freundii. no cross-reactivity of  the anti-cmy-2 antibody was seen against laboratory strains of e. coli possessing tem-1, shv-1, k-1, or oxa-1 beta-lactamases. operating conditions for performing  elisas were optimized. both anti-cmy-2 and anti-shv-1 antibodies detected picogram quantities of purified protein in elisas. the reactivity of the anti-cmy-2 antibody was tested against a number of ampc beta-lactamases by assaying known quantities of purified enzymes in elisas (ampc beta-lactamases of  m. morganii, c. freundii, e. coli, and e. cloacae). as the homology to cmy-2 beta-lactamase decreased, the minimum level needed for detection increased (e.g., 94% homology recognized at 1 ng/ml and 71% homology recognized at 10 ng/ml). the  elisas were used to assay unknown clinical isolates for ampc and shv beta-lactamases, and the results were confirmed with pcr amplification of bla(ampc) and bla(shv) genes. overall, we found that our elisas were at least 95% sensitive and specific for detecting shv and ampc beta-lactamases. the elisa format can facilitate the identification of ampc and shv beta-lactamases and can  be used to quantify relative amounts of beta-lactamase enzymes in clinical and laboratory isolates.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == jaundice as an early diagnostic sign of urinary tract infection in infancy.
AB  == objective: urinary tract infections (utis) are a common clinical problem in febrile infants younger than 8 weeks old, with a prevalence between 5% and 11%. previous studies have noted that jaundice may be one of the first signs of a bacterial infection in infants. our goal was to determine the incidence of utis in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old and to determine which historical and laboratory parameters are associated with utis. methods: we  prospectively evaluated asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old  for evidence of a uti (defined as >10 000 colony-forming units per milliliter of  a single pathogen, obtained by bladder catheterization). a serum fractionated bilirubin level was obtained on all study patients. detailed questionnaires were  completed, which included demographic information, prenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal events. results: twelve (7.5%) of 160 infants had a uti (95% confidence interval: 3.9%-12.7%). isolated organisms included escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus, klebsiella pneumoniae, group b streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, and staphylococcus aureus. patients with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age had a higher incidence of uti, 6 (50%) of 12 infants in the positive culture group, versus 15 (10%) of 148 infants in the negative culture group. abnormal urinalysis and microscopy results were noted in 5 (42%) of 12 infants with a uti, and 6 (55%) of 11 infants had abnormal renal ultrasound results. conclusion: a uti was found in 7.5% of asymptomatic, afebrile, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old. in addition, infants with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age or patients with an elevated conjugated bilirubin fraction were more likely to have a uti. therefore, we recommend that testing for a uti be included as part of the evaluation in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants presenting  to the emergency department.

TI  == a note: gut bacteria produce components of a locust cohesion pheromone.
AB  == aims: faecal pellets from germ-free locusts were used as culture media to determine the ability of locust gut bacteria to synthesize phenolic components of the locust cohesion pheromone. methods and results: inoculation of germ-free faecal pellets with pantoea agglomerans, a species commonly isolated from locusts, resulted in the release of large amounts of guaiacol and small amounts of phenol, both of which are components of the locust cohesion pheromone. two other locust-derived species, klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae, also produced guaiacol from germ-free faecal pellets, but the opportunistic locust pathogen, serratia marcescens, did not. the most likely precursor for guaiacol is the plant-derived vanillic acid, which is present in large amounts in the faeces of both conventional and germ-free locusts. conclusions: these observations are consistent with previous ones, that locust gut bacteria are responsible for the production of components of the locust cohesion pheromone. significance and impact of the study: these findings illustrate how an insect can adapt to make use of a common bacterial metabolite produced by one or more of its indigenous gut bacterial species. this observation has implications for our appreciation of insect gut microbiota interactions.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from patients with various infections.
AB  == aims: isolates from various samples obtained during 1998 and 1999 were identified and their susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, monobactams and/or cephamycins studied along with any production of esbls. methods and results: of these samples, bacteria most frequently isolated by the conventional techniques and vitek gni card were escherichia coli (37%), klebsiella pneumoniae (27%) and enterobacter cloacae (16%). using disk diffusion and double-disk synergy tests, we found that 71% strains produced esbls and 18% strains produced esbls and cephamycinases. banding patterns of pcr amplification with the designed primers showed that 57% strains were capable of harbouring bla(shv) genes. the bla(tem),  bla(cmy) and bla(ampc) genes were harboured by 55%, 31% and 12% strains, respectively. forty-five percent of strains contained more than two types of beta-lactamase genes. in particular, one strain contained bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(cmy) and bla(ampc) genes. conclusions: the percentage of esbl-producing strains was high. the most prevalent beta-lactamase gene was bla(shv) gene. the bla(cmy) genes have been prevalent in cephamycin-resistant strains. the multidrug-resistant strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and cephamycins were detected in high percentage. significance and impact of the study: resistance mechanisms to beta-lactams, comprising mostly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production, lead to the resistance against even recently developed beta-lactams in enterobacteria, which is now a serious threat to antibiotic therapy. the high prevalence of bla(cmy) genes and multidrug-resistant genes may also cause therapeutic failure and lack of eradication of these strains by third-generation cephalosporins or cephamycins.

AB  == objective: to investigate the pharmacodynamic disposition of two recently developed beta-lactam antibiotics, meropenem and cefpirome, in the yucatan micropig model, and to compare the bactericidal activity of these drugs against bacteria in this in vitro/ex vivo micropig model after administration by both intermittent injection and continuous infusion. methods: cefpirome (1 g) was given to the micropig over a 12-h period by direct intravenous injection and 6-h  continuous infusion (500 mg). meropenem (250 mg) was administered either by 30-min intravenous and 8-h continuous infusion. the two drugs were assayed by hplc. the pharmacodynamics of these drugs were evaluated by means of (1) serum killing curve against klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, stably derepressed enterobacter cloacae and methicillin-susceptible penicillinase-producing staphylococcus aureus, and (2) calculations of index of surviving bacteria (isb). results: the bactericidal activity of meropenem against k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae in this in vitro/ex vivo model was excellent, with a 4 log decrease at peak concentrations. meropenem produced a mixed concentration- and time-dependent, killing effect against e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. the isb value ranged from 25% to 30% for e. cloacae. with concentrations above mic for s. aureus (1 mg/l), cefpirome has a time-dependent bactericidal activity, as shown by the isb ranging from 20% to 80% after 4 h and between 20% and 40% after an 8-h drug exposure. for both antibiotics, the higher concentrations obtained just after intermittent injection had a rapid and strong killing effect against the strains tested, but the trough  levels had no bactericidal activity. the continuous infusions produce consistent  concentrations of antibiotic that can be maintained above the mic, and the bactericidal activity of which ranges from 2 to 4 log10 decrease of inoculum. conclusions: in the present study the micropig has been shown to be an adequate model for the pharmacodynamic investigation of cefpirome and meropenem. in general, continuous infusion appears to optimize the pharmacodynamic profile of the two tested beta-lactam antibiotics. however, against gram-negative bacilli, the administration of a loading dose prior to continuous infusion of beta-lactams would eliminate the only potential pharmacokinetic disadvantage of continuous infusion and ensure the rapid onset of antimicrobial activity.

TI  == three cefotaximases, ctx-m-9, ctx-m-13, and ctx-m-14, among enterobacteriaceae in the people's republic of china.
AB  == of 15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae collected from the first municipal people's hospital of guangzhou, in the southern part of the people's republic of china, 9 were found to produce ctx-m esbls, 3 produced shv-12, and 3 produced both ctx-m and shv-12.  eleven isolates produced either tem-1b or shv-11, in addition to an esbl. nucleotide sequence analysis of the 12 isolates carrying bla(ctx-m) genes revealed that they harbored three different bla(ctx-m) genes, bla(ctx-m-9) (5 isolates), bla(ctx-m-13) (1 isolate), and bla(ctx-m-14) (6 isolates). these genes have 98% nucleotide homology with bla(toho-2). the bla(ctx-m) genes were carried  on plasmids that ranged in size from 35 to 150 kb. plasmid fingerprints and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed the dissemination of the bla(ctx-m) genes through transfer of different antibiotic resistance plasmids to different bacteria, suggesting that these resistance determinants are highly mobile. insertion sequence isecp1, found on the upstream region of these genes, may be involved in the translocation of the bla(ctx-m) genes. this is the first report of the occurrence of shv-12 and ctx-m esbls in china. the presence of strains with these esbls shows both the evolution of bla(ctx-m) genes and their dissemination among at least three species of the family enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae, isolated within a single hospital. the predominance of ctx-m type enzymes seen in this area of china appears to be similar to that seen in south america but is different from those seen in europe and north america, suggesting different evolutionary routes and selective pressures. a more comprehensive survey of the esbl types from china is urgently needed.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory isolates of enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus in italy: incidence and trends over the period 1997-1999.
AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and of  staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the respiratory tract was assessed over the period 1997-1999 as part of the italian epidemiological observatory survey sponsored by the smith-kline foundation. a standardised method was used to determine the mics of 22 antibiotics against isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (n=870), escherichia coli (n=684), enterobacter cloacae (n=342), enterobacter aerogenes (n=187) and serratia marcescens (n=135) as well as the mics of 11 antibiotics against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n=1,606). overall, the susceptibility rate of enterobacteriaceae isolates was > or = 90% to 5 agents (meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, cefepime and gentamicin); 89-80% to 2 agents (ciprofloxacin and tobramycin); and <80% to 11 agents (cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefetamet, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, tetracycline, piperacillin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, ticarcillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and amoxicillin). during the 3-year monitoring period, antibiotic susceptibility increased in klebsiella pneumoniae against amoxicillin-clavulanate, in escherichia coli against third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, in enterobacter aerogenes against amoxicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam and in serratia marcescens against most of the antibiotics. in contrast, enterobacter cloacae showed a tendency to develop resistance to cefetamet, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. of the total number of staphylococcus aureus strains, 38% were methicillin resistant. nearly 80% of the methicillin-resistant strains displayed  a multiresistance pattern (additional resistance to 2 or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics). rates of susceptibility of particular species (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus) were compared using strains  from different geographical areas of italy (northern, central and southern) and from different nosocomial areas (outpatients, intensive care unit [icu] inpatients, non-icu inpatients). susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae to several antibiotics was lower in southern italy, whereas the incidence of methicillin-resistant strains was higher in northern and central italy. the susceptibility of escherichia coli was similar in all three areas. no significant differences in susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae or escherichia coli were found between strains from inpatients and outpatients or from inpatients admitted to icu and non-icu units. the incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was higher in icu inpatients (52%) than in non-icu inpatients (38%) and lower in outpatients (19%) than in inpatients.

TI  == multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in taiwan.
AB  == a susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (icus) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from march, 2000, to june, 2000, in taiwan. this study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (orsa), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), enterobacter cloacae (57%), serratia marcescens (34%), and citrobacter freundii (60%). high rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for p. aeruginosa (15%) and acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. the percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for klebsiella pneumoniae. rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (42%), enterococcus faecium (71%), and orsa (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. the resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of icus. surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in icu settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in icu patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

TI  == development of a thin tube cultivation method for determining coliform counts in  milk.
AB  == a new rapid coliform-monitoring method using thin tube cultivation (ttc) was developed. one hundred microliters of modified selective medium (1.5% agar) and 100 microl of sample were mixed in thin cultivation tubes, yielding a semisolid mixture of 0.75% agar. the tubes were incubated at 37 degrees c and checked for a positive reaction (gas production from lactose fermentation and color changes from acid production) at 30-min intervals. the positive reaction times for ttc were compared with actual coliform numbers. the first experiment was performed to validate the ttc method using pure coliform cultures (the escherichia coli group, the enterobacter cloacae group. and the klebsiella pneumoniae group). the results indicated that the ttc method saved about 10 to 14 h of incubation time compared  with the conventional plating method. when coliforms were present in small numbers, such as i to 1.5 log10 cfu/ml, the ttc method detected their presence within 10 h. when highly contaminated samples were assayed (6 log10 cfu/ml), the  ttc method detected the presence of coliforms within 4 to 5 h. in a food system experiment, pasteurized skim milk inoculated with a coliform mixture was assayed  by the ttc method. the coliforms in the milk were quickly detected, resulting in  a savings of 11 to 14 h compared with the conventional plating method. cold-injured coliforms were studied to evaluate the ttc system. the recovery and  estimation of injured coliforms by the ttc method strongly agree with those of the conventional plating method. the ttc system was also applied to ascertain the levels of natural coliforms in noninoculated milk. the ttc system reduced incubation times by about 11 to 14 h compared with the conventional plating method. according to these data, this method is a rapid, simple, accurate, and economical way to monitor and estimate total coliforms in milk.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities among clinical isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria in a taiwanese university hospital.
AB  == infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with resistance to extended-spectrum  cephalosporins require the identification of effective alternative antimicrobial  therapy. to determine the role of other pre-existing or currently available antimicrobial agents in treating infections caused by these multidrug-resistant pathogens, we evaluated the in vitro susceptibilities of these agents in 411 non-duplicate isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria recovered between january 1999 and december 1999 in a major teaching hospital in taipei, taiwan. these isolates included cefotaxime-resistant (mics >  or = 2 mg/l) escherichia coli (66 isolates) and klebsiella pneumoniae (77 isolates); cefotaxime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) enterobacter cloacae (59 isolates), serratia marcescens (52 isolates) and citrobacter freundii (52 isolates); and ceftazidime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) pseudomonas aeruginosa (50 isolates) and acinetobacter baumannii (55 isolates). overall, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) had good activity against the cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae tested (>90% of isolates were susceptible). however, carbapenems had limited activity against the ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa  (only 4% of isolates were susceptible) and a. baumannii (51-56% of isolates were  susceptible). among the e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates tested, 33.3% and 58.4%, respectively, exhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, determined by the double disc method. over 80% of cefotaxime-resistant e. cloacae and c. freundii were susceptible to cefepime, but this agent had limited activity against other bacteria tested. susceptibilities of these isolates to ciprofloxacin varied, ranging from 25% for a. baumannii to 92% for e. cloacae. newer fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin) had equal or less activity against these organisms, except for a. baumannii for which their mic(90)s (8-16 mg/l) were four- to 16-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin (mic(90) 128 mg/l).

TI  == trends in quinolone susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae among inpatients of a large university hospital: 1992-98.
AB  == objectives: to assess trends in quinolone susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae isolated in a large university hospital. methods: between 1992 and 1998, bacterial isolates were collected each year during a 3-month period to evaluate annual changes in susceptibility. in addition, the activities of fluoroquinolones (pefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) against nalidixic acid-resistant strains were determined by disk diffusion and mic methodologies during the first and last year of the study. results: the susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae to nalidixic acid was unchanged between 1992 and 1998 (86% versus 85%). however, at the species level, the susceptibility rates to nalidixic acid decreased for escherichia coli from 92% to 89%, and for enterobacter cloacae from 87% to 82%. in contrast, there was a 10% increase in the nalidixic acid susceptibility rates for klebsiella pneumoniae (74% versus 83%), which was thought to be due to the control of the spread of epidemic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains. the overall susceptibility of the enterobacteriaceae to the fluoroquinolones remained high during the study period, greater than 90% in the case of ciprofloxacin. however, nalidixic acid-resistant  escherichia coli showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin between 1992 and 1998, as reflected by a decrease in median zone diameter (26 mm to 19 mm), an increase in mic(50) (0.25 mg/l to 1 mg/l) and a shift in mic distribution (unimodal in 1992 to bimodal in 1998). this has resulted in the reduced susceptibility of escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones between 1992 and 1998 (pefloxacin, 95-90%; ciprofloxacin, 99-95%). conclusions: the susceptibility of escherichia coli to quinolones has decreased, and the level of susceptibility of  the resistant strains has increased over the 7-year study period.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826; l-749,345), a new carbapenem with a long serum half-life, was tested, in vitro, against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. the new compound had a mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited of 0.06 microg/ml for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiellas, compared with 0.5  microg/ml for imipenem, 16 microg/ml for cefepime, and >128 microg/ml for ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam. mics of ertapenem for ampc-derepressed mutant enterobacteriaceae were 0.015 to 0.5 microg/ml, whereas imipenem mics were 0.25 to 1 microg/ml and those of cefepime were 0.5 to 4 microg/ml, and resistance to ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam was generalized. despite this good activity, the mics of ertapenem for esbl-positive klebsiellas mostly were two- to fourfold above those for esbl-negative strains, and the mics for ampc-hyperproducing enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii mutants exceeded those for the corresponding ampc-basal mutants. these differentials did  not increase when the inoculum was raised from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu/spot, contraindicating significant lability. carbapenemase producers were also tested.  the imp-1 metallo-beta-lactamase conferred substantial ertapenem resistance (mic, 128 microg/ml) in a porin-deficient klebsiella pneumoniae strain, whereas a mic of 6 microg/ml was recorded for its porin-expressing revertant. sme-1 carbapenemase was associated with an ertapenem mic of 2 microg/ml for serratia marcescens s6, compared with <0.03 microg/ml for serratia strains lacking this enzyme. in summary, ertapenem had good activity against strains with potent beta-lactamases, except for those with known carbapenemases.

TI  == bacterial cholangitis in patients with biliary atresia: impact on short-term outcome.
AB  == bacterial cholangitis (bc) is a common complication in patients with biliary atresia (ba) and is characterized by fever, acholic stools and positive blood cultures. the diagnosis is often empirical because the yield of blood cultures is low. it is difficult to differentiate bc from other febrile episodes. in order to characterize the clinical and laboratory features of bc in patients with ba, identify risk factors, and correlate cholangitis with outcome, 37 patients with ba from 1993 to 1998 who underwent a kasai operation in our hospital were studied. the follow-up period ranged from 6 to 59 months. a total of 107 febrile  episodes were documented in these patients. the diagnostic criteria for cholangitis were fever, increased jaundice, or acholic stools. the clinical features, laboratory data, results of bacterial cultures, and outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. a total of 107 febrile episodes, including 78 bouts of  cholangitis and 29 non-cholangitis infections, were found in 34 patients. patients with bc had higher postoperative bilirubin levels (p = 0.02) and less frequent use of prophylactic antibiotics (p = 0.05) than those with non-cholangitis infections. abnormal white blood cell counts (> 12,000 or <4,000  mm3) tended to be present in patients with bc (p = 0.08). there were no statistical differences in the risk factors and laboratory data between culture-positive (n = 16) and -negative (n = 62) cholangitis cases. the occurrence of cholangitis significantly reduced survival in both patients with good (p = 0.03) and inadequate bile flow (p = 0.03). all 9 patients who had never had cholangitis survived during the follow-up period. repeated attacks of bc further decreased survival probability. the responsive organisms were mainly enteric bacteria, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanni, and salmonella typhi. the sensitivity tests justified empirical therapy with ceftriaxone. the effectiveness of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or neomycin warrants  further studies. bc was a highly prevalent postoperative complication in patients with ba, especially those with inadequate bile drainage. it significantly affected early mortality. aggressive and complete treatment with empirical ceftriaxone was appropriate.

TI  == multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance  to ss-lactam antibiotics. only 1% of the escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. this rate was higher for other enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for p. aeruginosa. the cross-resistance of oxacillin with other  antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance was only a minor problem in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of argon fluoride (arf) excimer laser on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of argon fluoride (arf) excimer laser radiation on clinically important strains of gram-negative bacteria. the antibacterial activity of arf excimer laser radiation was evaluated on two acinetobacter baumannii, one enterobacter cloacae, three escherichia coli, two helicobacter pylori, one klebsiella pneumoniae and two pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens and typed by the usual biochemical procedures. square agar plates of 12 x 12 cm were divided into rectangular (2 x 3 cm) regions and spread with 0.5x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu)/ml of bacterial suspension. the excess liquid was removed and the plates were allowed to dry for 30 min. a total of 96 rectangular  (2x3 cm) regions were used for each strain, in order to test an equal number of laser parameters. each rectangular region was irradiated with different laser parameters, using a 193 nm arf excimer laser, linked with a simple galilean afocal system and a rectangular diaphragm of the same dimensions as the original  laser beam cross-section, at a distance of 10 cm from the irradiated surface. this system was used in order to keep the laser pulse energy under 80 mj and to cut-out the non-transverse electromagnetic mode branches of the laser beam. we then studied the bacterial survival ratio versus the number of laser pulses, the  repetition frequency and the total laser beam fluence. our results showed that the total laser beam fluence was the most important parameter to consider in evaluating the bactericidal effect of arf excimer laser radiation. a critical value of the total fluence was determined for each strain, such that, for laser beam fluences greater than this critical value, no colonies appeared to survive while, for laser fluences less than this critical value, the survival ratio did not exceed 2 x 10(7) cfu (2 x 10(-5)%). these critical values were found to vary  between 8 j/cm2 and 16 j/cm2 for the bacterial species studied. under these conditions, arf laser irradiation is promising for the sterilisation of hard surfaces and for in situ application.

TI  == efficacy of cefepime versus ceftazidime in the treatment of adult pneumonia.
AB  == effective empiric treatment of pneumonia requires antibiotic coverage against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant isolates. this study evaluated the efficacy of cefepime treatment in 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and 21 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap), and ceftazidime treatment in 20 patients with hap. the mean age  of patients was over 70 years. more than half of the patients had multiple lobe involvement. there was no significant difference in the severity of illness according to the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (apache) iii score between the hap-cefepime and hap-ceftazidime group. the most common bacteria isolated from sputum of patients with cap were streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 7), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). in patients with hap, p. aeruginosa (n = 13), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 11), serratia marcescens (n = 6), k. pneumoniae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia  (n = 5), enterobacter cloacae (n = 3), citrobacter spp. (n = 2), and escherichia  coli (n = 2) were isolated. the cure rates were 95%, 76%, and 60% in the cap-cefepime group, the hap-cefepime group, and the hap-ceftazidime group, respectively. the increased rates of antimicrobial resistance commonly found among isolates causing cap and hap indicate that extended-spectrum antimicrobial  agents, such as cefepime, would be more appropriate therapeutic agents.

TI  == nosocomial necrotising enterocolitis outbreaks: epidemiology and control measures.
AB  == necrotising enterocolitis (nec) is one of the most serious gastrointestinal diseases among newborns and it mainly affects those in intensive care units. the  aetiology of the disease has been reported to be multifactorial and both sporadic cases and nosocomial outbreaks have occurred. in this report, we review 17 epidemics of nec reported in the literature between 1973 and 1999. the number of  confirmed cases ranged from 1 to 32 with an average of 10.5 confirmed cases. on average, 16.15% of cases required surgery (range 0-66.6%). the average mortality  rate was 6.25% (range 0-87.5%). the mean age at disease onset was 9.5 days (range 6.6-29 days). most of the infants had low birth weight (median weight 1,395 g; range 1,112-2,788 g, calculated on the reported mean weights). the main risk factors associated with nec were: low birth weight, low gestational age, low apgar score, perinatal complications, hyaline membrane disease, and umbilical catheterisation. the bacteria involved often included enterobacteriaceae, particularly escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae type 3305573. the causative role of clostridia in nec is controversial. with regard to viral agents, coronarovirus, rotavirus and enterovirus, such as echovirus type 22, were isolated during some of the epidemics. the recommended control measures for nec epidemics are those used for epidemics of other orofaecally transmitted infections. conclusion: understanding the epidemiology of necrotising enterocolitis is fundamental if adequate preventive control measures  are to be developed and applied.

AB  == the dispersion of potentially pathogenic, antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via expressed human milk can be considered a risk factor. the aim of this study was to contribute to a better understanding of coliform isolates from expressed human milk and their antimicrobial resistance profiles. the sampling scheme followed a  totally randomized design, using 837 samples of expressed human milk. of these, 71 (8.48%) were identified as contaminated with total coliforms, although in none of the samples did the population exceed 1.0x10(3) mpn/ml. most of the microorganisms isolated (91.6%) belonged to only two species, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae, which when subjected to antibiograms, revealed that several strains showed prior resistance to some of the antimicrobials tested. coliforms may grow in expressed human milk if it is improperly stored, depleting protection factors and reducing the milk's nutritional value.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

TI  == interaction of bladder glycoprotein gp51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: a major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein gp51 (molecular weight 51 kd.). gp51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. gp51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). increased urinary gp51 occurs during urinary tract infection. to elucidate the role of gp51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. materials and methods: elisa was performed to demonstrate the binding of gp51 and various uropathogens. immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to gp51 to determine the interaction of gp51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize gp51. antigen inhibition elisa was done to quantitate urinary gp51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. results: elisa revealed that gp51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. immunochemical methods confirmed that purified gp51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. clinical specimens showed gp51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial  cells. we observed a significant increase in urinary gp51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). conclusions: these studies suggest that gp51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.

TI  == phenotypic resistance of staphylococcus aureus, selected enterobacteriaceae, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa after single and multiple in vitro exposures to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin.
AB  == the phenotypic resistance of selected organisms to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin was defined as a mic of > or =4 microg/ml. the dynamics of resistance were studied after single and sequential drug exposures: clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa), escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were utilized. after a single 48-h exposure of a large inoculum to four times the initial mic for the organism, the frequency of selection of resistant mutants of mssa was greater for trovafloxacin than levofloxacin (p = 0.008); for e. cloacae, the frequency was highest for ciprofloxacin and lowest for levofloxacin and trovafloxacin; for s. marcescens, the frequency was highest for trovafloxacin and lowest for ciprofloxacin (p = 0.003). the results of serial passage experiments were analyzed both by the kaplan-meier product-limited method as well as by analysis of variance of mean inhibitory values. by both methods, mssa and mrsa expressed mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin after fewer passages than were required for either levofloxacin or trovafloxacin. for the aerobic gram-negative bacilli, two  general patterns emerged. mutants resistant to trovafloxacin appeared sooner and  reached higher mean mics than did mutants resistant to levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin appeared later and reached mean mics lower than the mics of the other two drugs studied. even though individual strain variation occurred, the mean mics were reproduced when the serial passage  experiment was repeated using an identical panel of e. coli isolates. in summary, the dynamic selection of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria can be demonstrated in experiments that employ serial passage of bacteria in vitro.

AB  == from the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, vibrionaceae, micrococcaceae, deinococcacea, bacillaceae, and the genus listeria. enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with citrobacter, streptococcus, aerococcus, and listeria found less frequently. we found bacillus cereus, enterobacter sakazakii, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. we also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as enterobacter cloacae, e. sakazakii, k. pneumoniae spp., providencia rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus. isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.

AB  == the rpoh regulatory region of different members of the enteric bacteria family was sequenced or downloaded from genbank and compared. in addition, the transcriptional start sites of rpoh of yersinia frederiksenii and proteus mirabilis, two distant members of this family, were determined. sequences similar to the sigma(70) promoters p1, p4 and p5, to the sigma(e) promoter p3 and to boxes dnaa1, dnaa2, camp receptor protein (crp) boxes crp1, crp2 and box cytr present in escherichia coli k12, were identified in sequences of closely related  bacteria such as: e.coli, shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. in more distant bacteria, y.frederiksenii and p.mirabilis, the rpoh regulatory region has a distal p1-like sigma(70) promoter and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. sequences similar to the regulatory boxes were not identified in these bacteria.  this study suggests that the general pattern of transcription of the rpoh gene in enteric bacteria includes a distal sigma(70) promoter, >200 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. a second proximal sigma(70) promoter under catabolite-regulation is probably present only in bacteria closely related to e.coli.

TI  == ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated  for a number of years. to assess the accuracy of data submitted to the world health organization by users of the whonet software, the centers for disease control and prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the united states, for antimicrobial susceptibility  testing as part of the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in klebsiella pneumoniae. many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae. the most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of  staphylococcus epidermidis. the proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as enterobacter cloacae. although only a small subset of  laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of  these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing s.  aureus atcc 25923 and s. pneumoniae atcc 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. the narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.

TI  == evaluation of current activities of fluoroquinolones against gram-negative bacilli using centralized in vitro testing and electronic surveillance.
AB  == given the propensity for enterobacteriaceae and clinically significant nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli to acquire antimicrobial resistance, consistent surveillance of the activities of agents commonly prescribed to treat  infections arising from these organisms is imperative. this study determined the  activities of two fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and seven comparative agents against recent clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia using two surveillance strategies: 1) centralized in vitro susceptibility testing of isolates collected from 27 hospital laboratories across the united states and  2) analysis of data from the surveillance network database-usa, an electronic surveillance network comprising more than 200 laboratories nationwide. regardless of the surveillance method, enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and a. baumannii demonstrated similar rates of susceptibility to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. susceptibilities to the fluoroquinolones approached or exceeded 90% for all enterobacteriaceae except providencia spp. (</=65%). approximately 70% of p. aeruginosa and 50% of a. baumanii isolates were susceptible to both fluoroquinolones. among s. maltophilia isolates, 50% more isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. overall, the rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility among enterobacteriaceae was 8.7%, with fluoroquinolone resistance rates notably higher among ceftazidime-nonsusceptible  isolates than ceftazidime-susceptible ones. multidrug-resistant isolates were present among all species tested but were most prevalent for klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. no gram-negative isolates resistant only to  a fluoroquinolone were encountered, regardless of species. thus, while levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin have maintained potent activity against enterobacteriaceae, the potential for fluoroquinolone resistance, the apparent association between fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance, and the presence of multidrug resistance in every species examined emphasize the need to  maintain active surveillance of resistance patterns among gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == microbial evaluation of spanish potato omelette and cooked meat samples in university restaurants.
AB  == the focus of this study was to evaluate the microbial quality of spanish potato omelette and cooked meat samples including pork loin, chicken croquettes, long pork sausage, chicken breast, and meatballs from university restaurants. microbiological analyses of spanish potato omelette and cooked meat samples resulted in aerobic plate counts from <1.00 to 2.90 and from <1.00 to 6.04 log10  cfu g(-1), respectively. total coliforms ranged from <3 to 43 most probable number (mpn) g(-1) and from <3 to >2,400 mpn g(-1) for spanish potato omelette and meat products, respectively. escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and lancefield group-d streptococci were detected in 1.7%, 3.5%, and 12.9% of spanish potato omelette samples, respectively. for cooked meat samples, 8.8%, 7.6%, and 24.6% contained e. coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and lancefield group-d streptococci, respectively. e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and shigella spp. were not detected. klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia spp. were isolated from spanish potato omelette samples. for cooked meat samples, c. freundii, e. cloacae, and aeromonas hydrophila were detected. the results suggest that some handling practices should require more attention, and as a consequence, a hazard analysis and critical control point program should be  developed and implemented.

TI  == enhancement of neonatal innate defense: effects of adding an n-terminal recombinant fragment of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein on growth and tumor necrosis factor-inducing activity of gram-negative bacteria tested in neonatal cord blood ex vivo.
AB  == innate defense against microbial infection requires the action of neutrophils, which have cytoplasmic granules replete with antibiotic proteins and peptides. bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) is found in the primary granules of adult neutrophils, has a high affinity for lipopolysaccharides (or "endotoxins"), and exerts selective cytotoxic, antiendotoxic, and opsonic activity against gram-negative bacteria. we have previously reported that neutrophils derived from newborn cord blood are deficient in bpi (o. levy et al., pediatrics 104:1327-1333, 1999). the relative deficiency in bpi of newborns raised the possibility that supplementing the levels of bpi in plasma might enhance newborn antibacterial defense. here we determined the effects of addition of recombinant 21-kda n-terminal bpi fragment (rbpi(21)) on the growth and tumor  necrosis factor (tnf)-inducing activity of representative gram-negative clinical  isolates. bacteria were tested in citrated newborn cord blood or adult peripheral blood. bacterial viability was assessed by plating assay, and tnf-alpha release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. whereas adult blood limited the growth of all isolates except klebsiella pneumoniae, cord blood also allowed  logarithmic growth of escherichia coli k1/r and citrobacter koseri. bacteria varied in their susceptibility to rbpi(21)'s bactericidal action: e. coli k1/r was relatively susceptible (50% inhibitory concentration [ic(50)], approximately  10 nm), c. koseri was intermediate (ic(50), approximately 1,000 nm), klebsiella pneumoniae was resistant (ic(50), approximately 10,000 nm), and enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were highly resistant (ic(50), >10,000 nm). all isolates were potent inducers of tnf-alpha activity in both adult and newborn cord blood. in contrast to its variable antibacterial activity, rbpi(21) consistently inhibited the tnf-inducing activity of all strains tested (ic(50), 1 to 1,000 nm). the antibacterial effects of rbpi(21) were additive with those of a combination of conventional antibiotics typically used to treat bacteremic newborns (ampicillin and gentamicin). whereas ampicillin and gentamicin demonstrated little inhibition of bacterially induced tnf release, addition of rbpi(21) either alone or together with ampicillin and gentamicin profoundly inhibited release of this cytokine. thus, supplementing newborn cord blood with rbpi(21) potently inhibited the tnf-inducing activity of a variety of gram-negative bacterial clinical pathogens and, in some cases, enhanced bactericidal activity. these results suggest that administration of rbpi(21) may  be of clinical benefit to neonates suffering from gram-negative bacterial infection and/or endotoxemia.

TI  == antigen 43 from escherichia coli induces inter- and intraspecies cell aggregation and changes in colony morphology of pseudomonas fluorescens.
AB  == antigen 43 (ag43) is a surface-displayed autotransporter protein of escherichia coli. by virtue of its self-association characteristics, this protein is able to  mediate autoaggregation and flocculation of e. coli cells in static cultures. additionally, surface display of ag43 is associated with a distinct frizzy colony morphology in e. coli. here we show that ag43 can be expressed in a functional form on the surface of the environmentally important pseudomonas fluorescens strain sbw25 with ensuing cell aggregation and frizzy colony types. using green fluorescence protein-tagged cells, we demonstrate that ag43 can be used as a tool to provide interspecies cell aggregation between e. coli and p. fluorescens. furthermore, ag43 expression enhances biofilm formation in p. fluorescens to glass surfaces. the versatility of this protein was also reflected in ag43 surface display in a variety of other gram-negative bacteria. display of heterologous ag43 in selected bacteria might offer opportunities for rational design of multispecies consortia where the concerted action of several bacterial  species is required, e.g., waste treatment and degradation of pollutants.

TI  == characteristics of neonatal bacterial meningitis in a teaching hospital in taiwan from 1984-1997.
AB  == during the period from 1984 to 1997, 85 bacterial meningitis neonates with positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures were treated. the ages of these patients ranged from 1 to 28 days. the male to female ratio was 1.7 to 1. the most common  causative agent was group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs, 31.8%), followed by escherichia coli (20%), proteus mirabilis (7.1%), enterobacter cloacae (5.9%), other streptococci excluding streptococcus pneumoniae (5.9%), chryseobacterium meningosepticum (5.9%), enterococci (4.7%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). among the 85 patients treated, 51 (60%) were younger than 7 days old. among them, dyspnea was the most common clinical manifestation. in contrast, fever and diarrhea were seen more frequently in neonates with late onset of disease (after  seven days of age). ampicillin and cefotaxime were the most commonly used antibiotics. the most frequently encountered complications were hydrocephalus and seizures. since 1991, gbs has overtaken e. coli as the leading cause of neonatal  bacterial meningitis. this was accompanied by a fall in the mortality rate, but a sustained high incidence of complications and sequelae. the results of this study highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent group b streptococcal infection.

TI  == rapid discriminatory detection of genes coding for shv beta-lactamases by ligase  chain reaction.
AB  == ligase chain reaction (lcr) is a recently developed technique that employs a thermostable ligase and allows for the discrimination of dna sequences differing  in only a single base pair. the method has been adapted and applied to differentiation of bla(shv) genes. we have developed an lcr typing method to characterize point mutations in genes for shv-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamases with four different sets of biotinylated lcr primers. to evaluate the applicability of the current technique, we tested seven escherichia coli strains producing shv-1, shv-2, shv-2a, shv-3, shv-4, shv-5, and shv-12. with the lcr typing, seven shv genes can be distinguished according to their incorporating point mutations. in an attempt to characterize shv beta-lactamases by lcr typing  in clinical isolates, 46 strains carrying bla(shv) genes (32 klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 enterobacter cloacae, and 4 e. coli) were subjected to antibiotic  susceptibility testing, isoelectric focusing, and lcr typing. lcr typing allowed  the characterization of beta-lactamases, and genotypes obtained by lcr typing were in accordance with phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance profile and pi value of beta-lactamase. therefore, we concluded that lcr typing may permit defining the shv families with simplicity and reliability and can be applied to the detailed characterization and molecular epidemiology of shv-type beta-lactamases.

AB  == for the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. we re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the  most common isolates were enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among hospital-acquired infections, acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. the oxacillin resistance of s. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. among enterococcus spp., 85% were either e. faecalis or e. faecium. they were 14% resistant to vancomycin. among gram-negative bacteria, k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. this difference was less apparent in the case of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. these bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. fifty-one percent of salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. isolates from the east were least resistant. plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we  identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against s. aureus, ciprofloxacin against e. coli, and ciprofloxacin against salmonella spp. these findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.

TI  == convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  == a simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of imp-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. two kirby-bauer disks containing ceftazidime (caz) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. several imp-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and edta were evaluated for this test. two caz disks were placed on a mueller-hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of  the caz disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. for imp-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was  observed for caz-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as ampc  or shv-12. as a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block imp-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and caz-resistant strains producing ampc or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from imp-1 producers by this test. a similar observation was made with imp-1-producing clinical isolates  such as serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter spp., and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. the specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of pcr analysis using bla(imp)-specific primers. therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.

AB  == study objective: to compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (clcr). interventions: serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. the mic data for 90% of organisms (mic90) were collected for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean mic90 was calculated. the t>mic was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean mic90. a t>mic of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except s. aureus (> or = 50%). measurements and main results: cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for all enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus at every clcr. imipenem  0.5 g achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, and s. aureus at every clcr. however, imipenem t>mic was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: s. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 90 ml/min), e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 80 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 100 ml/min), s. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), and e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 50-70 ml/min). ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours  (clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus only. at every dose and clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable t>mic for s. aureus but  not for any enterobacteriaceae at clcr > 50 ml/minute. piperacillin did not achieve desirable t>mic for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a t>mic of 70% or above for p. aeruginosa at any clcr. conclusion: at every clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable t>mic for more nosocomial pathogens than any other  beta-lactam evaluated. based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate  empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. however, when p. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteria in mexico.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins within members of the family enterobacteriaceae occurs virtually world-wide. nevertheless, nothing was known about this problem among isolates from mexico. to address this issue, we studied  oximino-cephalosporin resistant isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (13), escherichia coli (7), and enterobacter cloacae (23) recovered from patients in mexico city hospitals during 1990 to 1992. in the presence of clavulanic acid, these strains increased susceptibility to cefotaxime and ceftazidime (mic90 64 and >256 microg/ml, respectively). the ability of these isolates to transfer resistance to both antibiotics by conjugation was most successfully demonstrated  by k. pneumoniae. in all the clinical isolates tested, the largest plasmid coded  for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). characteristics of pi, by isoelectric focusing (ief)/bioassay and dna hybridization with specific probes of tem and shv, indicated that in most of the clinical isolates and all transconjugates, the most frequent beta-lactamase coded were shv-derived (20 strains as 41% of isolates) and a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase (12 strains as 25% of isolates) (with a pi of >8.2), which is not related to tem/shv. apparently, isolates from mexico show characteristics similar to isolates from other geographic areas. the type of beta-lactamases coded in these resistant isolates is documented for the first time in mexico.

TI  == the distribution of enteric bacteria from australian mammals: host and geographical effects.
AB  == bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 642 mammalian hosts, representing 16 families and 79 species, collected from throughout australia. escherichia coli was the most common of the 24 enteric species recovered and represented almost half of the isolates. association analysis revealed that most  other species of bacteria were less likely to be recovered from hosts in which e. coli was present. the composition of the enteric community of a host was found to be determined by both the taxonomic family to which the host belonged and the geographical area from which the host was collected. hosts collected from the northern areas of queensland and the northern territory had more diverse enteric  communities than hosts collected from new south wales or western australia. hosts of the families petauridae and vespertilionidae had more diverse enteric communities than did members of the macropodidae or phalangeridae. the probability of occurrence of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae in a host was found to vary with respect to host family and/or host locality. the non-random distribution of these species demonstrates the presence of extensive population structure and may suggest the existence of adaptations specific to both the primary and secondary habitats of these enteric bacteria.

TI  == characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in north america: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program evaluates  international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. we describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from utis during the third-quarter of 1997 in north america (united states and canada), as part of this worldwide program. the isolates were  tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and automated ribotyping. the five most frequently isolated species were escherichia coli (48.6%), enterococcus spp. (13.7%), klebsiella spp. (12.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and enterobacter spp. or  proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). for each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. for gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against e. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the usa were vancomycin-resistant (88% with van a). p. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem  (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). e. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), k. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (amp c) stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). these data demonstrated that several uti isolates in  sentry hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == penetration of beta-lactamase inhibitors into the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the effectiveness of a beta-lactamase inhibitor/beta-lactam combination against gram-negative pathogens depends on many interplaying factors, one of which is the penetration of the inhibitor across the outer membrane. in this work we have measured the relative penetrations of clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam and  brl 42715 into two strains of escherichia coli producing tem-1 beta-lactamase, two strains of klebsiella pneumoniae producing either tem-1 or k-1, and two strains of enterobacter cloacae each producing a class c beta-lactamase. it was shown that clavulanic acid penetrated the outer membranes of all these strains more readily than the other beta-lactamase inhibitors. for the strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae clavulanic acid penetrated approximately 6 to 19 times more effectively than tazobactam, 2 to 9 times more effectively than sulbactam and 4 to 25 times more effectively than brl 42715. the superior penetration of clavulanic acid observed in this study is likely to contribute to the efficacy of clavulanic acid/beta-lactam combinations in combating beta-lactam resistant bacterial pathogens.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == [survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  == research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. the activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. the broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,241 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between october and  december 1996. the results were as follows: carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against mssa and streptococcus pneumoniae and showed low activities against mrsa. their activities against enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ampicillin and piperacillin. the carbapenems showed high activities against haemophilis influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae. enterobacter cloacae. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group. their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains of serratia marcescens were detected. the antibacterial activity of carbapenems against pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of caz, and there were some resistant strains.

TI  == use of microdilution panels with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors as a phenotypic test for beta-lactamase production among escherichia coli, klebsiella  spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens.
AB  == over the past decade, a number of new beta-lactamases have appeared in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae that, unlike their predecessors, do not confer beta-lactam resistance that is readily detected in routine antibiotic susceptibility tests. because optimal methodologies are needed to detect these important new beta-lactamases, a study was designed to evaluate the ability of a  panel of various beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors to discriminate between the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, high levels of k1 beta-lactamase, and other beta-lactamases in 141 isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens possessing well-characterized beta-lactamases. the microdilution panels studied contained aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, with and without 1, 2, and 4 microg of clavulanate per ml or 8 microg of sulbactam per ml  and cefoxitin and cefotetan with and without 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. the results indicated that a minimum panel of five tests would provide maximum separation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase high ampc, high k1, and other beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae. these included cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftriaxone plus 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. ceftriaxone plus 2 microg of clavulanate per ml could be substituted for cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml without altering the accuracy of the tests. this study indicated that tests with key beta-lactam drugs, alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, could provide a convenient approach to the detection of a variety of beta-lactamases in members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (gpc), gram-negative  bacillary (gnb), and fungal blood-stream infections (bsis) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. study design: case series. methods: demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven bsis was analyzed. early-onset bsis were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset bsis as those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsis were treated with ampicillin and  gentamicin, and suspected late-onset bsis with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsis were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. gpc (83% due to group b streptococcus [gbs]) accounted for approximately one half of  early-onset bsi cases and gnb (68% enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. early-onset gbs declined from 24 to 11 cases (p=.04) and late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases (p<.01) from the first to the last study period. sixty-eight percent of late-onset bsis were due to gpc (primarily coagulase-negative staphylococcus), 18% to gnb, and 14% to fungus. over the study period, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and  gentamicin. although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn bsi cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 enterococcus faecalis isolates. all fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. conclusion: we observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset bsis due to gbs and an increase in late-onset bsis due to gpc, gnb, and fungi. the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset bsis and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset bsis has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.

TI  == stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  == aim: to serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. methods: stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. quantitative aerobic and anaerobic  cultures were performed. results: by day 30, predominant species were enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterbacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. in breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (se 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. on day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. conclusions: the gut of extremely low birthweight infants  is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.

TI  == in vivo activities of peptidic prodrugs of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl-1  beta-methylcarbapenems.
AB  == a series of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (thf)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems which have excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activities exhibit modest efficacies against acute lethal infections (3.8 mg/kg of body weight against escherichia coli and 0.9 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus) in mice when they are administered orally. in an effort to improve the efficacies of orally administered drugs through enhanced absorption by making use of a peptide-mediated transport system, several different amino acids were added at the aminomethyl thf side chains of the carbapenem molecules. the resulting peptidic prodrugs with l-amino acids demonstrated improved efficacy after oral administration, while the d forms were less active than the parent molecules. after oral administration increased (3 to 10 times) efficacy was exhibited with the alanine-, valine-, isoleucine-, and phenylalanine-substituted prodrugs against acute lethal infections in mice. median effective doses (ed50s) of < 1 mg/kg against infections caused by s. aureus, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, or penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained after the administration of single oral doses. several of the peptidic prodrugs were efficacious against morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, and e. coli infections, with ed50s of 1 to 14 mg/kg by oral administration compared with ed50s of 14 to > 32 mg/kg for the parent molecules. in general, the parent molecules demonstrated greater efficacy than the prodrugs against these same infections when the drugs were administered by the subcutaneous route. the parent molecule was detectable in the sera of mice after oral administration of the peptidic prodrugs.

TI  == high turnover rate of escherichia coli strains in the intestinal flora of infants in pakistan.
AB  == the escherichia coli flora of infants in developed countries is dominated by one  or a few strains which persist for prolonged periods of time, but no longitudinal studies have been performed in developing countries. to this end, we studied the  rectal enterobacterial flora in 22 home-delivered pakistani infants during their  first 6 months of life. three colonies were isolated and species typed on each of 11 sampling occasions. e. coli isolates were strain typed using electromorphic typing of cytoplasmic enzymes, and their o serogroups were determined. there was  a very rapid turnover of enterobacterial strains in the rectal flora of individual infants. on average, 8.5 different e. coli strains were found per infant, and several biotypes of other enterobacteria. less than 50% of the infants were colonized with e. coli from their mothers, but strains of maternal origin were four times more likely to persists in the infants' flora than other e. coli strains. enterobacteria other than e. coli were always of non-maternal origin, and enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae biotypes recovered from contaminated feeds were later identified in the infants' rectal flora. an early colonization with klebsiella or enterobacter was significantly associated with diarrhoea during the neonatal period, although these bacteria were not likely to be the cause of the disease. the results suggest that poor hygienic conditions result in an unstable and diverse enterobacterial flora, which may influence infant health.

TI  == bacteriological monitoring in the prague burns center.
AB  == the microbiological aspect of the prevention of nosocomial infections at the burn center consists primarily in the surveillance of bacterial flora and its antibiotical resistance. the prague burn center is regularly monitoring the microbial flora. patients are examined not only by the conventional methods of taking swabs of burned sites, but also by printing method, which allows a semiquantitative assessment of the colonization of burned areas. simultaneously,  investigation of bacterial contamination in the external environment of the department is carried out and the colonization of nursing staff is investigated.  in all isolated strains the sensitivity to antibiotics is examined; this is significant from the point of view of current knowledge about therapeutic possibilities and for the antibiotic policy. the typing of bacterial strains makes possible to determine their epidemiological markers, and thus to investigate their spread within the department. the most frequent isolate is s. aureus and the prevalence of mrsa is relatively high. among gramnegative rods the strains of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae are most often isolated. various typing methods revealed endemic spread of particular strains of rarely isolated species (e. agglomerans, s. marcescens, a. baumannii, etc.).

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == infective endocarditis in the premature neonate.
AB  == we describe a series of 11 high-risk neonates with infective endocarditis (ie) in this retrospective review. previously ie has rarely been diagnosed in newborns and is usually fatal. the frequency was 4.3 cases per 100 patients. five patients survived. microorganisms included gram positives such as s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, gram negatives such as klebsiella pneumoniae,  enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, serratia marcescens, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. echocardiographic location of the lesions showed four left sided, five right sided, and two bilateral. we conclude that ie may be  more common than previously described. prompt diagnosis and treatment led to survival in 45% of our patients. prospective studies are needed to identify patients at risk and to establish the true incidence of ie in high-risk neonates.

TI  == comparison of five days versus seven days of incubation for detection of positive blood cultures by the bactec 9240 system.
AB  == the specimen capacity of blood culture systems is determined by the length of time that blood cultures are incubated. since the patient populations served by hospitals vary, individual laboratories should evaluate the relative cost and benefits of different testing regimens for their particular setting. to be cost-effective, the use of a 5-day rather than a 7-day protocol for the bactec 9240 system (becton dickinson diagnostic instrument systems, usa) has been recommended. to evaluate whether the shorter schedule would be appropriate at the microbiology laboratory at the national cheng kung university medical center in tainan, taiwan, the yield from 5 days versus 7 days of incubation was compared using a total of 9653 blood specimens collected from 1 april to 30 september 1997. of the 1848 positive vials, 1822 (98.6%) were positive in the first 5 testing days; only 26 (1.4%) were positive on day 6 or 7. only five of the latter vials were judged to contain clinically significant organisms: one cryptococcus neoformans, one candida albicans, one enterobacter cloacae, one klebsiella pneumoniae, and one proteus mirabilis. two vials contained organisms whose clinical significance was categorized as unknown, while 19 contained organisms that were considered contaminants. these data suggest that, for the laboratory studied, the 5-day protocol for the bactec 9240 system is more cost-effective than the 7-day protocol and is adequate for detection of positive blood cultures.

TI  == bacteria causing septicaemia in neonates with tetanus.
AB  == 105 consecutively admitted neonates with tetanus were screened for sepsis to determine the prevalence of sepsis in neonatal tetanus (nnt) patients and identify the bacterial pathogens causing septicaemia in them. the presence of omphalitis, poor colour, hypothermia and hyperthermia were found to be sensitive  predictors of septicaemia in nnt patients. 50 bacterial pathogens were isolated from 50 babies. klebsiella pneumoniae (20.7%), and enterobacter cloacae (19.0%) were the leading gram negatives, while staphylococcus aureus (19.2%) was the prevalent gram positive organism isolated. antimicrobial susceptibility profile heavily favours ofloxacin but a combination of cloxacillin and gentamicin is recommended as first line. ceftazidime with about 60% susceptibility across board is the favoured cephalosporin.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of oral isolates of enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae from a southern chinese population.
AB  == the antibiotic susceptibilities of 59 enterobacter cloacae and 39 klebsiella pneumoniae human oral isolates collected from a southern chinese population in hong kong were investigated for their susceptibility to eight antibiotics: ampicillin, cephalothin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole using the e-test method for direct quantification of minimum inhibitory concentrations. most strains were sensitive  to all antibiotics except ampicillin and cephalothin. ampicillin resistance was exhibited by 82% of k. pneumoniae and 69% of e. cloacae isolates. eighty-eight percent of e. cloacae isolates were resistant to cephalothin. several strains fell within the intermediate category of sensitivity for ampicillin (e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae), cefuroxime (e. cloacae) and tetracycline (k. pneumoniae). comparison with other hong kong data suggests that resistance rates to cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole exhibited by the oral isolates are generally lower  than in enterobacters and klebsiella spp. isolated from urine, skin and soft tissues in hong kong populations.

TI  == the prognostic factors of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis.
AB  == seventy-seven patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm), 57 males and 20 females, aged 17-86 years, were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital, over an 11-year period. fifty-four infections were community-acquired, and 23 were nosocomial; 49 were spontaneous and 28 occurred after head surgery or neurosurgery. the organisms most frequently involved were klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter. rarer pathogens included citrobacter species, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. all patients who did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy died. the mortality in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 28%. other statistically significant prognostic factors included septic shock, initial level of consciousness, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, high cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels and leucocytosis. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only appropriate antimicrobial therapy and septic shock were strongly associated with mortality even after adjusting for other potentially confounding factors. despite the high mortality, management can be improved by early diagnosis, early use of appropriate antibiotics, and correction of underlying and associated medical derangement.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

TI  == direct antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gram-negative bacilli in blood cultures by an electrochemical method.
AB  == nonfastidious aerobic gram-negative bacilli (gnb) are commonly isolated from blood cultures. the feasibility of using an electrochemical method for direct antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gnb in positive blood cultures was evaluated. an aliquot (10 microliter) of 1:10-diluted positive blood cultures containing gnb was inoculated into the bactometer module well (biomerieux vitek,  hazelwood, mo.) containing 1 ml of mueller-hinton broth supplemented with an antibiotic. susceptibility tests were performed in a breakpoint broth dilution format, with the results being categorized as resistant, intermediate, or susceptible. seven antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, amikacin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin) were used in this study, with each agent being tested at the two interpretive breakpoint concentrations. the inoculated modules were incubated at 35 degreesc, and the change in impedance in  each well was continuously monitored for 24 h by the bactometer. the mics of the  seven antibiotics for each blood isolate were also determined by the standardized broth microdilution method. of 146 positive blood cultures (1,022 microorganism-antibiotic combinations) containing gnb tested by the direct method, the rates of very major, major, and minor errors were 0, 1.1, and 2.5%, respectively. the impedance method was simple; no centrifugation, preincubation,  or standardization of the inocula was required, and the susceptibility results were normally available within 3 to 6 h after inoculation. the rapid method may allow proper antimicrobial treatment almost 30 to 40 h before the results of the  standard methods are available.

TI  == radiological pulmonary changes during gram-negative bacillary nosocomial bloodstream infection in premature infants.
AB  == objective: the objective of the study was to characterize the changes that occur  in chest radiographs at the time of gram-negative bacilli (gnb) nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and to determine the contribution of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) and airway gram-negative bacterial pathogens to the clinical diagnosis of gnb nosocomial pneumonia. study design: this retrospective investigation involved 41 bsi infants (study group) and 50 gnb airway colonized infants who had sepsis workup with negative blood cultures (control group). we correlated clinical findings (95 blood and 305 tracheal aspirate (ta) cultures) with radiographic findings noted within 2 days before, the day of, and the day after blood cultures. two radiologists independently graded 258 films using a modified score for bpd and a semiquantitative score ("probable," "possible," or "unlikely") for pneumonia. results: mean birth weight was 1057 gm and 1044 gm for the study and control groups, respectively. of the study population, 54% were male, 21% were black, 89% received surfactant, 79% received dexamethasone, and 88% survived. average age at the time of blood cultures for both groups was 23 days. most common isolates from blood and ta were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. eight bsi infants died, mainly as a result of p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae; three control patients also died. radiological findings were that bpd scores did not change in relation to bsi and were similar between study and control groups. of the bsi patients, 21 presented with newly positive ta at the time of positive blood culture; "probable" or "possible" pneumonia was diagnosed in 18 of them. their bpd scores were higher than those of the remaining bsi patients, of whom seven were already airway colonized, nine had negative tas, and four were not intubated. only one of these 20 patients had "possible" pneumonia noted on chest  x-ray films. conclusion: radiographic signs of air space disease accompanied by the recovery of gnb respiratory pathogens from the blood and from a previously uncolonized airway strongly support the clinical diagnosis of gnb nosocomial pneumonia. radiological signs of bpd are stable in relation to nosocomial bsi caused by gnb, but bpd radiological scores are higher among infants who also had  a newly acquired respiratory gnb. bsi, new respiratory tract gnb, and bpd are critical associations for the clinical interpretation of radiographic changes in  the ventilated newborn.

TI  == bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies.
AB  == the decision regarding the appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies must be individualized in each institution, by taking into account variations in the patterns of microbial  isolates and their resistance profiles. microbial isolates and antibiotic resistance patterns must be taken into account at each hospital. a shift from bacteremia due to infections caused by predominantly gram-negative organisms to predominantly gram-positive organisms in patients with hematologic malignancies has been noted in reports from other countries. we investigated bacterial isolates and their antibiotic sensitivities in patients with hematologic malignancies in the veterans general hospital-taipei. a total of 185 episodes of  bacteremia in 140 patients with hematologic malignancies were recorded during the period from 1995 to 1996. unlike foreign reports, our investigation shows that gram-negative organisms still predominate, accounting for 72.7% of isolates, followed by gram-positive organisms, accounting for 26.3% of isolates, and anaerobes, accounting for 1% of isolates. escherichia coli was the most commonly  isolated organism, accounting for 23.9% of isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.2%), enterobacter cloacae (7.3%),  and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (7.3%). a high mortality rate was observed in gram-negative bacteremia: 31% for e. coli, 26% for k. pneumoniae, 24% for p. aeruginosa, and 33% for e. cloacae. if methicillin-resistant s. aureus bacteremia occurred, mortality was high (47%). the antibiotic sensitivity profiles of the four most common gram-negative isolates (e. coli, k. pneumoniae,  p. aeruginosa, and e. cloacae) indicated that, in our hospital, amikacin with either cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, or imipenem, would be an ideal combination for empirical therapy for bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies.

AB  == in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a  total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against  e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for  this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == [occurrence and susceptibility of hospital strains producing enzymes with a wide  spectrum of substrate profiles].
AB  == in connection with more and more frequent occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases an effort has been made to detect their presence in the biological materials coming from the patients of different wards of mining hospital in sosnowiec from january to september 1995. among 38 diagnostic materials, from which the strains in question were isolated, the following materials have been examined: bronchial lavage (52.6%), surgical wounds (18.4%),  urines (15.8%) and others (13.2%). the examined diagnostic materials came from intensive care unit (87.0%), casualty and orthopaedic surgery clinic (5.0%) and general surgery clinic (3.0%). the most frequently isolated microorganisms were klebsiella pneumoniae. (47.4%), serratia marcescens (36.8%), enterobacter cloacae (10.5%) and others (5.3%). half of the examined strains constituted those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases and probably possessing an extra resistance mechanism: (serratia marcescens--74%, enterobacter cloacae--21%, enterobacter aerogenes--5.0%) and 50% were those producing extended--spectrum beta-lactamases. (klebsiella pneumoniae--95%, escherichia coli--5%). susceptibility of the examined strains to anti-microbial antibiotics was diverse. full susceptibility of the analysed strains has been observed exclusively in case of karbapenems (imipenem, meropenem and cefamycyn). in case of beta-lactamase with beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations susceptibility was diverse and dependent on the species of the examined microorganism.

TI  == [multiple organ failure with several weeks' persistence of ards: successful therapy with methylprednisolone].
AB  == a 21-year-old female who had developed ileus underwent abdominal surgery for adhesiolysis. because of postoperative bleeding she required repeated surgical reexploration. subsequently, the patient developed abdominal sepsis (enterobacter cloacae) and, on day 11 of mechanical ventilation, severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ards) (lung injury score 3.5, pao2/fio2 55 mmhg). despite clearing the abdominal situation, chest films showed persisting and new pulmonary infiltrates, leucocytosis, fever and purulent bronchial secretion occurring over  a period of five weeks. despite aggressive antibiotic treatment the patient deteriorated further and disease progressed to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. at the beginning of week six all bacteriological specimens (blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, urine, catheter tips) were negative for potential pathogens. possible extrapulmonary infection sites were cleared by computed tomography and tc 99 labeled antigranulocyte antibody scan. open lung biopsy was  performed on day 33 of ards and revealed severe diffuse alveolar damage in the fibroproliferative phase of ards. on day 37 after ards onset, antibiotic treatment was discontinued and methyl-prednisolone (32 mg every 6 hours, 2.5 mg/kg.day) was started. after five days a significant improvement of pulmonary function (lung injury score decreased from 3.5 to 2.5, pao2/fio2 increased from 82 to > 200 mmhg) and of cardiovascular performance occurred. corticosteroid treatment was continued for 29 days and was complicated by an episode of pneumonia (klebsiella pneumoniae) requiring antibiotic therapy. the patient's trachea was successfully extubated on day 80. she was discharged from intensive care unit on day 93 and left hospital three weeks later. we conclude that late ards may cause systemic inflammatory response and persisting organ dysfunction without an identifiable source of infection. corticosteroid therapy might improve fibroproliferative changes of the lung even if instituted weeks after the onset of ards.

TI  == course and management of renal subcapsular abscess in a 63-year-old diabetic woman.
AB  == renal subcapsular abscess is a very rare disease that is defined by a suppurative process localized to a space between the renal capsule and the renal parenchyma.  the course and management of subcapsular abscesses have received less attention than those of renal and perirenal abscesses. we describe a 63-year-old diabetic woman who presented with intermittent fever of 1 month's duration. she was initially treated for suspected acute pyelonephritis then referred to our hospital because of poor clinical response to cefazolin plus gentamicin. computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a huge subcapsular abscess with displacement and compression of the left renal parenchyma. a percutaneous catheter was inserted and left in place for 8 days; a total of approximately 850 ml of pus was drained. culture of the pus yielded klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a 2-week course of moxalactam was administered on the basis of the results of in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing. the distorted renal parenchyma appeared normal at sonographic follow-up examination 3 weeks after hospitalization. the course and management of this rare entity are presented as a reminder to physicians that renal subcapsular abscess could manifest as fever of  unknown origin in a diabetic patient. a high degree of clinical suspicion is required for early diagnosis and treatment in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

TI  == dna shuffling of a family of genes from diverse species accelerates directed evolution.
AB  == dna shuffling is a powerful process for directed evolution, which generates diversity by recombination, combining useful mutations from individual genes. libraries of chimaeric genes can be generated by random fragmentation of a pool of related genes, followed by reassembly of the fragments in a self-priming polymerase reaction. template switching causes crossovers in areas of sequence homology. our previous studies used single genes and random point mutations as the source of diversity. an alternative source of diversity is naturally occurring homologous genes, which provide 'functional diversity'. to evaluate whether natural diversity could accelerate the evolution process, we compared the efficiency of obtaining moxalactamase activity from four cephalosporinase genes evolved separately with that from a mixed pool of the four genes. a single cycle  of shuffling yielded eightfold improvements from the four separately evolved genes, versus a 270- to 540-fold improvement from the four genes shuffled together, a 50-fold increase per cycle of shuffling. the best clone contained eight segments from three of the four genes as well as 33 amino-acid point mutations. molecular breeding by shuffling can efficiently mix sequences from different species, unlike traditional breeding techniques. the power of family shuffling may arise from sparse sampling of a larger portion of sequence space.

TI  == effects of requiring prior authorization for selected antimicrobials: expenditures, susceptibilities, and clinical outcomes.
AB  == antimicrobial control programs are widely used to decrease drug expenditures, but effects on antimicrobial resistance and outcomes for patients are unknown. when a requirement for prior authorization for selected parenteral antimicrobial agents  was initiated at our urban, county teaching hospital, total parenteral antimicrobial expenditures decreased by 32%. susceptibilities to all beta-lactam  and quinolone antibiotics increased, with dramatic increased susceptibilities in  isolates recovered in intensive care units, increased susceptibilities in isolates recovered in other inpatient sites, and little change in susceptibilities in isolates recovered in outpatient sites despite no change in infection control practices. for patients with bacteremia due to gram-negative organisms, overall survival did not change with restrictions. no differences occurred in the median time from initial positive blood culture to receipt of an  appropriate antibiotic or in the median time from positive blood culture to discharge from the hospital. thus, requiring preapproval for selected parenteral  agents can decrease antimicrobial expenditures and improve susceptibilities to antibiotics without compromising patient outcomes or length of hospital stay.

TI  == development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  == very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. this study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents,  including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. mics of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarblue; accumed international, westlake, ohio). this study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus species, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in some instances, the mics were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. the proposed in-flight experiment will  include inoculation of the vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of mics by the mission's astronauts. ground-based studies have shown reproducible mics following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees c to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. for comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) mic values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation  of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. this procedure  can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

AB  == background: the genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in antimicrobial resistance of 10 strains of gramnegative bacilli (1 serratia marcescens; 2 escherichia coli; 1 proteus mirabilis; 4 klebsiella pneumoniae; 1 enterobacter cloacae y 1 alcaligenes faecalis), isolated from adult patients with nosocomial pulmonary infection at the in-patient facilities of the university hospital of los andes, merida, venezuela, have been studied. methods: the antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentrations using the dilution method in agar. the study of extrachromosomal genes was carried out by conjugation, bacterial infection with the bacteriophage m13 and curing of plasmid by acridine orange. the plasmids were isolated by alkaline lysis and analysis of  restriction endonuclease digestion was carried out separately using the enzymes ecori and hindiii. a dna probe, derived from the region which encodes the tem-1 beta-lactamase of the plasmid pbr322 was used for dot-blot hybridization tests. results: all of the gramnegative bacilli showed resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin (> 128 micrograms/ml) and 3 strains also showed resistance to gentamicin (> 64 micrograms/ml). genetic and molecular procedures showed the presence of conjugative plasmids of approximately 54 kb in all the 10  strains. the restriction patterns obtained by using ecori and hindiii indicated common dna fragments in most of the plasmids studied. the dot-blot hybridization  tests confirmed homology between the plasmids and the dna probe used (tem-1 beta-lactamase). conclusions: in this study, the gramnegative bacteria of nosocomial origin harbored self-transferable plasmids of approximately 54 kb, which mediate resistance to gentamicin and encode a beta-lactamase of the tem group.

TI  == a monoclonal antibody reacts with maltose-binding protein of escherichia coli and related enteric bacteria.
AB  == maltose-binding protein (mbp) encoded by male is essential for the energy-dependent translocation of maltose through the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. its property of specific binding to maltose has been used in constructing fusion proteins for easy affinity purification. a monoclonal antibody named mab sc1d7 was produced against escherichia coli mbp. this mab also bound to mbp-containing recombinant proteins in both western blotting and immunoprecipitation analysis. as a result, this mab can be a useful probe for tracing mbp-fusion proteins in various applications. furthermore, intrinsic mbps  from e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae were also detected by this mab. no reaction was observed with the total proteins from serratia marcescens, aeromonas hydrophila and plesiomonas shigelloides. these observations suggest that the mab sc1d7-defined epitope is conserved among some enteric bacteria, but not the others. the results strengthen the phylogenetic positions of these closely related bacteria previously placed by other means.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  == the main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus saprophyticus and candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. the residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were  both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. these results support the ongoing  efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 11 hospitals during the period of june 1995 to may 1996. of  the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) showed the highest activities against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. vancomycin (vcm) and piperacillin (pipc) were also active with the  mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa vcm showed the highest activities against s. aureus isolated from  patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml against both s. aureus and mrsa. arbekacin (abk) was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. the other except minocycline (mino) had very low activities with the mic90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis abk and mino showed the strongest activities against s. epidermidis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. vcm was also active with the mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. the mic90s of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml  in 1995. these results indicated that some resistances existed among s. epidermidis to cephems. 4. streptococcus agalactiae all drugs except gentamicin (gm) were active against s. agalactiae. abpc, cefmenoxime (cmx), ipm, erythromycin (em), clindamycin (cldm) and clarithromycin (cam) showed the highest activities. the mics for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. the mic90s of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. citrobacter freundii ipm showed the highest activity against c. freundii isolated from patients utis. its  mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. gm was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop) and amikacin (amk) were also active with the mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cmx, cpr and czop showed low activities with mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. enterobacter  cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. mino and tosufloxacin (tflx)  were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cpr and czop showed lower activities with the mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml  or above. 7. escherichia coli. most of the antimicrobial agents were active against e. coli. particularly cpr, czop and ipm showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. cmx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. penicillins were slightly active with mic90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml or below. carumonam (crmn) had the strongest activity against k. pneumoniae, the mics for all strains were equal to  or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of k. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. for example, the mic90s of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. proteus mirabilis p. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. cmx, ceftazidime (caz), cefixime (cfix), and crmn showed the highest activities against p. mirabilis isolated from patients with utis. mics of crmn for all

TI  == imipenem resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae is associated with the combination of act-1, a plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase, and the foss of an outer membrane protein.
AB  == six escherichia coli and 12 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from a single hospital expressed a common beta-lactamase with a pi of approximately 9.0 and were resistant to cefoxitin and cefotetan (mic ranges, 64 to > 128 and 16 to > 128 micrograms/ml, respectively). seventeen of the 18 strains produced multiple beta-lactamases. most significantly, three k. pneumoniae strains were also resistant to imipenem (mics, 8 to 32 micrograms/ml). spectrophotometric beta-lactamase assays with purified enzyme indicated hydrolysis of cephamycins, in addition to cephaloridine and benzylpenicillin. the 4ene encoding the pi 9.0 beta-lactamase (designated act-1 for ampc type) was cloned and sequenced, which revealed an ampc-type beta-lactamase gene that originated from enterobacter cloacae and that had 86% sequence homology to the p99 beta-lactamase and 94% homology to the partial sequence of mir-1. southern blotting revealed that the gene encoding act-1 was on a large plasmid in some of the k. pneumoniae strains as well as on the chromosomes of all of the strains, suggesting that the gene is  located on an easily mobilized element. outer membrane protein profiles of the k. pneumoniae strains revealed that the three imipenem-resistant strains were lacking a major outer membrane protein of approximately 42 kda which was present  in the imipenem-susceptible strains. act-1 is the first plasmid-mediated ampc-type beta-lactamase derived from enterobacter which has been completely sequenced. this work demonstrates that in addition to resistance to cephamycins,  imipenem resistance can occur in k. pneumoniae when a high level of the act-1 beta-lactamase is produced in combination with the loss of a major outer membrane protein.

TI  == bactericidal activity of cefodizime on enterobacteriaceae in an in-vitro model simulating plasma pharmacokinetics in humans.
AB  == an in-vitro dialysis model was employed to assess the feasibility of once-daily dosing of cefodizime in the treatment of infections caused by various enterobacteriaceae: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, providencia stuartii and enterobacter cloacae. this model simulated the concentrations of cefodizime detected in human blood after an intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection of 1 g or 2 g of the antibiotic. validation of the model was undertaken to confirm its utility. based on the data obtained with  this model, once-daily dosing with 1 g cefodizime (i.v.) should be effective against infections due to the commonest gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, m. morganii). for infections caused by enterobacteriaceae strains that produce large quantities of class i beta-lactamases, twice-daily (p. stuartii or s. marcescens) or four times daily (e. cloacae) administration of 1 g cefodizime may be required.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

AB  == objectives: antibiotic susceptibility of 649 gram-negative bacilli involved in severe infections and isolated in 18 teaching hospitals from january to december  1992 was evaluated. methods: minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method for piperacillin, piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem, and by a microdilution method for 11 other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin, ciprofloxacin,  fosfomycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin). criteria of comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie were followed for interpretation. betalactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing and overproduction of cephalosporinase was defined by the resistance phenotype. the main species isolated were escherichia coli (45%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8%), salmonella spp. (7.5%), enterobacter cloacae (4%) and klebsiella oxytoca (4%). most of the strains were isolated from blood culture (72.3%), respiratory tract (11.4%) and intraabdominal infections (8.6%). most of  the enterobacteria isolates were susceptible to imipenem, aztreonam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (percentages of susceptibility were respectively 99.3, 98, 98.3 and 96.3); in most of cases clavulanic acid did not entirely restore sensitivity to amoxicillin of penicillinase-producing strains. among 89 p. aeruginosa strains, 82% were susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime, 81% to the association piperacillin + tazobactam and 51% to ticarcillin. resistance rates are very high  for acinetobacter baumannii except for imipenem. conclusion: production of tem-type penicillinase and over-production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase are the most widely observed mechanisms of resistance (respectively 22% and 9% of 649 strains). prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases was low (1%) and essentially observed for k. pneumoniae.

AB  == a plasmidic beta-lactamase which hydrolyzed cephamycins was first detected and reported in 1989. at that time its description was restricted to phenotypic characteristics. we analyzed nucleotide sequence of its gene and explored it genetic relationship with other bla genes. the deduced amino acid sequence of the blacmy-1 product was compared with those of other known plasmidic cephamycinases  and of chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases. the results indicate that the relationship of cmy-1 is closest to mox-1 among the plasmidic cephamycinases and  to ampc of pseudomonas aeruginosa among the chromosomal cephalosporinases. we conclude that the plasmidic cephamycinases described up to now may be classified  into three families, as follows: cmy-1, mox-1, and fox-1 with ampc of p. aeruginosa; cmy-2, bil-1 and lat-1 with ampc of citrobacter freundii; and mir-1 with ampc of enterobacter cloacae. plasmidic cephamycinases are now recognized as clinically relevant class c beta-lactamases.

AB  == a synthetic peptide, kffkffkffk [corrected], consisting of cationic lysine residues and hydrophobic phenylalanine residues was found to sensitize gram-negative bacteria to hydrophobic and amphipathic antibiotics. at a concentration of 3 micrograms/ml, it decreased the mic of rifampin for smooth, encapsulated escherichia coli by a factor of 300. other susceptible bacterial species included enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhimurium, but pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant. similar results were obtained with another synthetic peptide, ikflkflkflk [corrected]. the fractional  inhibitory concentration indices for the synergism of these peptides with rifampin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, and novobiocin were very close to those determined for the previously characterized potent outer-membrane-disorganizing agents polymyxin b nonapeptide and deacylpolymyxin b. kffkffkffk [corrected] had  direct activity against the gram-positive organism micrococcus strain ml36, was strongly hemolytic, and was as active on polymyxin-resistant e. coli mutants as on their parent. these three attributes made kffkffkffk [corrected] different from polymyxin derivatives and similar to cationic detergents, such as cetylpyridinium chloride. however, whereas the mic of cetylpyridinium chloride for e. coli is low (0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml), that of kffkffkffk [corrected] is much higher (30 to 100 micrograms/ml). other groups of synthetic peptides studied included polymyxin-like peptides with an intrachain disulfide bridge. their synergism with antibiotics was less marked. still other peptides, including kekekekeke and kkkkkkflfl, lacked any synergism with the probe antibiotics.

(13%) isolates. half of them were resistant to several antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. a total of 27 of 30 k. pneumoniae isolates (90%) adhered to the human cell line intestine-407 (int-407), while none of the k. oxytoca or e. aerogenes isolates and only 2 of the e. cloacae isolates adhered. three adhesive  patterns were observed for k. pneumoniae: an aggregative adhesion in 57% of the isolates, a diffuse adhesion in only one isolate, and a new pattern, localized adhesion, in 30% of the isolates. while most of the sensitive strains adhered with the aggregative phenotype, the localized pattern was associated with resistant k. pneumoniae isolates producing the caz-5 beta-lactamase. furthermore, 45% of such localized-adhesion isolates were involved in severe infections. the distributions of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, enteroaggregative e. coli, and cf29, pap, and afa/dr adhesin-encoding genes were determined by using specific dna probes. no relationship was found between the adhesive pattern and the production of specific fimbriae, suggesting that several unrecognized adhesive factors are involved. our study indicates that special adhesive properties associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents could account for the pathogenicity of certain nosocomial strains.

AB  == the adherence of 12 oral isolates and 4 type strains of enterobacteriaceae (equally representing enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii) to hela cell monolayers following five different incubation conditions (sucrose, d-mannose, serum, mem and candida albicans gdh 1957) was investigated. incubation with sucrose and d-mannose resulted in the greatest and least adherence, respectively. the presence of preadherent c. albicans gdh 1957 on the hela cells tended to enhance the adherence of certain strains of e. cloacae and c. freundii, but had no overall impact on enterobacteriaceae adherence. while heterogeneity of behaviour existed between strains within species, e. cloacae was the most, and k. pneumoniae the least, adherent species irrespective of incubation conditions. haemagglutination assays  indicated the presence of mannose-resistant type 1 fimbriae associated with all enterobacteriaceae. in clinical terms, the variations in adherence properties observed in vitro may contribute to an understanding of the different prevalence  rates of oral enterobacteriaceae reported in the literature.

TI  == evaluation of the use of bactec anaerobic blood cultures in the detection of bacteraemia and fungaemia in children.
AB  == in an attempt to reduce costs, the role of bactec anaerobic blood culture in the  detection of bacteraemia and fungaemia in children was evaluated. results from 3167 sets of aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures from children admitted to the university hospital, kuala lumpur during a one year period, were analysed. four hundred and eight (12.9%) sets of blood cultures were positive, of which 348 sets (11.0%) from 201 patients were clinically significant. of the 348 significant positive sets, organisms were isolated on 177 (50.9%) occasions from both aerobic and anaerobic bottles, on 136 (39.1%) occasions from the aerobic bottle only and  35 (10.0%) occasions from the anaerobic bottle only. no strict anaerobes were isolated, but clinically significant isolates recovered from the anaerobic bottle only included klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella species, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and group b streptococcus. patients with bacteraemia diagnosed solely by anaerobic culture were distributed evenly across the various paediatric subspecialities. when results from the anaerobic bottles were excluded, the overall isolation rate was reduced from 11% to 9.9%. potential financial savings  resulting from omission of anaerobic cultures must be balanced against the small  number of bacteraemic episodes that could be missed. undiagnosed bacteraemia may  result in increased morbidity and mortality with its own attendant financial implications.

TI  == [current aspects of the fecal flora of the newborn without antibiotherapy during  the first 7 days of life: enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, staphylococci].
AB  == last years, il became obvious that the colonization pattern described in 1976-1978 was no more valid: early colonization by enterobacteriaceae at the 2-3  rd day of life in all newborns, with constant presence of antibioresistant strainseven in non treated newborns. to establish the new pattern of colonization, the same quantitative method of dilution and culture on selective media was used daily from day 1 to day 7 (5 days only for m). the number of enterobacteriaceae, enterococci and staphylococci was determined in the stools of 10 newborns in the maternity unit (= m) (term 40 weeks +/- 1, birth weight 3,356  g +/- 383), 10 in the premature nursery (= p) (term 34.9 weeks +/- 1, birth weight 2,457 g +/- 676), and 14 in the neonatal intensive care unit (= r) (term 35.2 weeks +/- 3.8, birth weight 2,457 g +/- 763). the results establish that colonization by enterobacteriaceae is no more constant at d3. it could be demonstrated only in 8/10 m, 1/10 p, and 6/14 r (statistically different - p < 0.01 - between m and p). at d5, 9/10 m, 5/10 p, 10/14 r, and at d7, 6/10 p and 10/14 r were colonized. resistant enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae) could be found in only 3/10 m, 4/10  p and 6/14 r. enterococci could be found in 1 newborn m, 2 p and 7 newborns r. staphylococci appeared earlier: all newborns m, p and r were colonized at d2, 4 and 5 respectively. these bacteria were coagulase negative, associated with staphylococcus aureus in 3 p. our hypothesis is that late colonization with enterobacteriaceae and enterococci is due to the improvement of hygiene procedures and due to the decontaminating effect of antibiotics in other treated  newborns (enterobacteriaceae by 3 rd generation cephalosporin and enterococci by  pharyngeal vancomycin).

TI  == gram-negative bacteremia in open-heart-surgery patients traced to probable tap-water contamination of pressure-monitoring equipment.
AB  == objective: to determine the cause(s) of an outbreak of gram-negative bacteremia (gnb) in open-heart-surgery (ohs) patients at hospital a. design: case-control and cohort studies and an environmental survey. results: nine patients developed  gnb with enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (3), serratia marcescens (2), or klebsiella oxytoca (1) following ohs; five of nine patients had polymicrobial bacteremia. when the gnb patients were compared with randomly selected ohs patients, having had the first procedure of the day (8 of 9 versus 12 of 27, p = .02), longer cardiopulmonary bypass (median, 122 versus 83 minutes, p = .01) or cross-clamp times (median, 75 versus 42 minutes, p = .008), intraoperative dopamine infusion (9 of 9 versus 15 of 27, p = .01), or exposure to scrub nurse 6 (6 of 9 versus 4 of 27, p = .001) were identified as risk factors. when stratified by length of the procedure, only being the first procedure of the day and exposure to scrub nurse 6 remained significant. first procedures used pressure-monitoring equipment that was assembled before surgery and left open and uncovered overnight in the operating room, whereas other procedures used pressure-monitoring equipment assembled immediately before the procedure. at night, operating rooms were cleaned by maintenance personnel who used a disinfectant-water solution sprayed through a hose connected to an automatic diluting system. observation of the use of this hose documented that this solution could have contacted and entered uncovered pressure-monitoring equipment left in the operating room. water samples from the  hose revealed no disinfectant, but grew p aeruginosa. the outbreak was terminated by setting up pressure-monitoring equipment immediately before the procedure and  discontinuing use of the hose-disinfectant system. conclusions: this outbreak most likely resulted from contamination of uncovered preassembled pressure-monitoring equipment by water from a malfunctioning spray disinfectant device. pressure-monitoring equipment should be assembled immediately before use  and protected from possible environmental contamination.

TI  == sulbactam and clavulanic acid: enzyme kinetics and synergy with ampicillin and mezlocillin.
AB  == the two beta-lactamase inhibitors, sulbactam and clavulanic acid, exhibit high affinity (k(i) < 10(-6)mol/l) for the beta-lactamases of gram-negative organisms  with predominantly penicillinase activity and much less affinity (especially clavulanic acid) for organisms with predominantly cephalosporinase activity. in tests to compare the synergy of these beta-lactamase inhibitors with other antibiotics, clavulanic acid and ampicillin or mezlocillin demonstrated greater synergy than sulbactam and ampicillin or mezlocillin, with isolates forming either a plasmid-coded beta-lactamase or a chromosomal enzyme with predominantly  penicillinase activity. however, neither sulbactam nor clavulanic acid were able  to protect ampicillin or mezlocillin adequately against inactivation by beta-lactamase overproducing variants of klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca, irrespective of the extent of synergy seen with the corresponding wild strains. it was interesting to note the synergy between mezlocillin and sulbactam with respect to beta-lactamase overproducing variants of clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae. a statistically significant correlation between the quantities of beta-lactamase formed and synergy between the beta-lactamase inhibitor and the antibiotic with which it was combined was not retained in studies of clinical isolates in any case. these observations correlate well with  the results obtained in routine testing of the combinations of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and ampicillin/sulbactam.

TI  == bacterial reduction of n-oxides of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (tsna).
AB  == 1. contrary to established metabolic pattern, a recent investigation of nnk metabolism produced in rat urine higher levels of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (nnk) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (nnal) than their n-oxides, suggesting that reconversion of n-oxides could occur after urine formation. 2. to verify the possible role of bacteria in the reduction of nnk-n-oxide and nnal-n-oxide to their respective parent compounds, nnk and nnal, in smokers with  urinary tract infection (uti), the n-oxides were isolated from the urine of rats  treated with [5-3h]nnk and individually incubated at 37 degrees c with ten bacterial species in sterile human urine under different ph regimens. after incubation with the bacteria, aliquots of culture media were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) with radiochemical detection. 3. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis possessed varying capacity to regenerate nnk and nnal from their n-oxides while others showed no detectable reductive capability within 24 h. 4. this result constitutes the first experimental evidence that in tobacco users with concomitant uti, bacterial regeneration of the procarcinogenic nnk and nnal  from their n-oxides could occur in the bladder leading to increased carcinogen burden in these individuals.

AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpirome against selected clinical enterobacterial isolates with beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
AB  == previous studies have shown that there is a high incidence of resistance to cephalosporins among enterobacteria isolated in greek hospitals. this resistance  is mainly due to either the derepression of chromosomal cephalosporinases or the  acquisition of plasmids coding for shv-5 type beta-lactamase. in the present study the activity of cefpirome against a number of enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and serratia marcescens) possessing the mechanisms mentioned above was examined. cefpirome was found active against all the strains characterized by stable derepression of chromosomal class-c enzymes. the antibiotic was less potent against strains expressing shv-5 type beta-lactamase due to its hydrolysis by the enzyme. also cefpirome exhibited good activity against e. aerogenes strains with  reduced susceptibility to imipenem. these in vitro data suggest that cefpirome might be useful in treating infections caused by these resistant microorganisms that are frequently encountered in greek hospitals.

TI  == bacterial pneumonia in recipients of bone marrow transplantation. a five-year prospective study.
AB  == bacterial pneumonia as an important complication of bone marrow transplantation (bmt) has not been subjected to comprehensive analysis. two hundred fifty-five consecutive allogeneic and autologous bmt recipients, ranging in age from 1 month to 53 years, were prospectively followed for 3 days to 3 years (median, 108 days) for development of bacterial pneumonia. etiology, place acquired, chest radiography, and outcome were recorded and the association between bacterial pneumonia and demographic and clinical variables was analyzed. thirty-seven (15%) patients experienced 52 episodes of bacterial pneumonia: onset of 13 episodes occurred within 30 days after transplantation, 10 episodes occurred on days +31 to +100, and 29 episodes occurred thereafter. bacterial pneumonia was the terminal event or contributed to fatal outcome in 8 patients (22% of bacterial pneumonia cases, 3% total study population). mortality due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (6/21) was significantly higher than (p = 0.03). bacterial pathogens were identified in 27 (52%) episodes. during the first 100 days after bmt, hospital-acquired gram-negative bacteria predominated, caused mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter lwoffi, and enterobacter cloacae. after day +100, community-acquired, gram-positive bacteria  predominated, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae. haemophilus influenzae occurred periodically. considering all episodes, significant association was found between bacterial pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease (vod) (p < 0.01) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) (p < 0.02). for culture-positive episodes, the association between bacterial pneumonia and vod was significant (p  < 0.001) and borderline for acute gvhd (p = 0.07). it is concluded that vod and gvhd are positively associated with post-bmt bacterial pneumonia. its incidence,  etiology, risk factors, and outcome are important considerations in its prevention and treatment.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == antibiotic-induced endotoxin release in patients with gram-negative urosepsis: a  double-blind study comparing imipenem and ceftazidime.
AB  == the clinical significance of differences between antibiotics in endotoxin-liberating potential is unknown. thirty patients with gram-negative urosepsis were randomized between imipenem and ceftazidime, which have, respectively, a low and a high endotoxin-liberating potential in vitro. in patients treated with ceftazidime, a slower defervescence was noticed. after 4 h  of treatment, the blood endotoxin level decreased in all 3 endotoxemic patients receiving imipenem, whereas it increased in 2 of the 4 endotoxemic patients receiving ceftazidime, and in ceftazidime-treated patients, the endotoxin level in urine decreased less than in imipenem-treated subjects. serum and urine cytokine levels increased 10%-40% after 4 h of ceftazidime treatment compared with no increase in the imipenem-treated patients (p > .05). endotoxin release during antibiotic killing in vitro, assessed for all microorganisms, was 10-fold  higher with ceftazidime (p < .001). these results indicate that differences between antibiotics in endotoxin release may affect the inflammatory response during treatment.

AB  == we typed 39 sets of multiple bacterial isolates of the same species from patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic dna (pfge). isolates were cultured from different sites or over a 2-week or longer interval. staphylococcus aureus,  enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae were tested. excluding e. cloacae, 28 of 32  sets of isolates (87%) demonstrated only identical or highly related pfge types.  four of the seven sets of e. cloacae showed different types. for species other than e. cloacae, our results suggest that patients are usually colonized and infected with a single strain of these bacterial pathogens. unlike all of the other tested species, e. cloacae pfge typing differences suggested the presence of multiple strains causing colonization and infection.

AB  == fifty clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, klebsiella  pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both e. coli and enterobacter  cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against  s. infantis, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. the pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. pyocyanin, the major metabolite of pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit escherichia coli, proteus spp. and other gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of  p. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. however, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of p. aeruginosa against  a large number of clinical isolates such as escherichia spp., klebsiella spp., and salmonella spp., up to now. for this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of  a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of e. coli, 30 of k. pneumoniae, 30 of s. infantis, 6 of enterobacter cloacae and 9 of proteus mirabilis.

TI  == multidrug resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae: a novel gene, rama, confers a multidrug resistance phenotype in escherichia coli.
AB  == spontaneous multidrug-resistant (mdr) mutants of klebsiella pneumoniae strain ecl8 arose at a frequency of 2.2 x 10(-8) and showed increased resistance to a range of unrelated antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim and puromycin. a chromosomal fragment from one such mutant was cloned, and found to confer an mdr  phenotype on escherichia coli k12 cells that was essentially identical to that of the k. pneumoniae mutant. almost complete loss of the ompf porin in the e. coli transformant, and of the corresponding porin in the k. pneumoniae mutant, was observed. the presence of the mdr mutation in k. pneumoniae or the cloned k. pneumoniae rama (resistance antibiotic multiple) locus in e. coli also resulted in active efflux of tetracycline, and increased active efflux of chloramphenicol. after transformation of a rama plasmid into e. coli, expression of chloramphenicol resistance occurred later than expression of resistance to tetracycline, puromycin, trimethoprim and nalidixic acid. the rama gene was localized and sequenced. it encodes a putative positive transcriptional activator that is weakly related to the e. coli mara and soxs proteins. a rama gene was also found to be present in an enterobacter cloacae fragment that has previously  been shown to confer an mdr phenotype, and it appears that rama, rather than the  roma gene identified in that study, is responsible for multidrug resistance. the  rama gene from the wild-type k. pneumoniae was identical to that of the mutant strain and also conferred an mdr phenotype on e. coli, indicating that the mutation responsible for mdr in k. pneumoniae had not been cloned.

AB  == the time-kill curve methodology was used to determine the pharmacodynamics of piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam and the combinations piperacillin-ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam. kill curve  studies were performed for piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam at concentrations of 0.25 to 50 times the mics for 13 strains of bacteria: four pseudomonas aeruginosa, three enterobacter cloacae, three klebsiella pneumoniae, and three staphylococcus aureus isolates (tazobactam concentrations of 0.5, 4, and 12 micrograms/ml). by using a sigmoid emax model and nonlinear least squares regression, the 50% lethal concentrations and the maximum lethal rates of each agent were determined for each bacterial strain. for piperacillin-ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam, kill curve  studies were performed with concentrations obtained by the fractional maximal effect method (r. c. li, j. j. schentag, and d. e. nix, antimicrob. agents chemother. 37:523-531, 1993) and from individual 50% lethal concentrations and maximum lethal rates. ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam was evaluated only against the four p. aeruginosa strains. interactions between piperacillin and ciprofloxacin were generally additive. at physiologically relevant concentrations of piperacillin and ciprofloxacin, ciprofloxacin had the highest rates of killing against k. pneumoniae. piperacillin-tazobactam (12 micrograms/ml) had the highest rate of killing against e. cloacae. piperacillin-ciprofloxacin with relatively higher ciprofloxacin concentrations had the greatest killing rates against s. aureus. this combination had significantly higher killing rates than piperacillin (p < 0.002). for all the bacterial strains tested, killing rates by ciprofloxacin were significantly higher than those by piperacillin-tazobactam (4 and 12 micrograms/ml had significantly higher killing rates than piperacillin alone (p < 0.02 and p < 0.004, respectively). the effect of the combination of piperacillin-ciprofloxacin, in which piperacillin concentrations were relatively  higher, was not statistically different from that of piperacillin alone (p > or = 0.71). the combination of ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam achieved greater  killing than other combinations or monotherapies against p. aeruginosa. the reduction in the initial inoculum was 1 to 4 logs greater with ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam at 4 and 12 micrograms/ml than with any other agent or combination of agents. on the basis of the additive effects prevalently demonstrated in the in vitro study, the combinations of piperacillin-ciprofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam are rational therapeutic options. greater killing of p. aeruginosa was demonstrated with ciprofloxacin-piperacillin--tazobactam. since treatment failure of p. aeruginosa  pneumonia is a significant problem, clinical studies are warranted.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains isolated from children in child health center, warsaw.
AB  == this study examines the antibiotic susceptibility of 1792 bacterial strains isolated from hospitalized children between january and december 1993. a total of 1015 gram-negative rods represented by members of enterobacteriaceae family (770) and nonfermenters (245) were isolated. the most resistant strains were noticed among klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. from 38% to 46% of k. pneumoniae strains were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, but all of  them were sensitive to imipenem. from 60% to 80% of e. cloacae isolates were resistant to all beta-lactams, but sensitive to imipenem. resistance of p. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides varied from 30% for gentamicin to 5% for amikacin.  about 40% of p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to carbenicillin, and 25% to azlocillin and piperacillin, but only two strains were resistant to ceftazidime and imipenem. among gram-positive cocci the most frequently encountered were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. the methicillin-resistant strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci and s. aureus consisted 74.8% and 34%, respectively. all strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and s. aureus were sensitive to vancomycin.

TI  == emergence and mechanisms of bacterial resistance in surgical infections.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is commonplace among bacteria involved in surgical infections, including staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and bacteroides species. resistance  traits can be encoded on chromosomes or transmissible plasmids. the basic mechanisms of resistance are alteration of drug target, prevention of drug access to target, and drug inactivation. examples include alteration of penicillin-binding proteins in resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins, ribosomal binding site protection in tetracycline resistance, and beta-lactamase  destruction of beta-lactam compounds. resistance due to the many types of beta-lactamases that have thus far been identified is wide-spread among common pathogens; use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations has proved effective as one means of counteracting such resistance. contending with resistance involves appropriate use of available antimicrobials, development of novel agents or modification of existing agents, and measures to forestall emergence and spread of resistant organisms.

TI  == control-related effective regrowth time and post-antibiotic effect of meropenem on gram-negative bacteria studied by bioluminescence and viable counts.
AB  == a study was performed to compare viable counts and bioluminescence for determining control related effective regrowth time (cert) and postantibiotic effect (pae) on gram-negative bacteria after two hours of exposure to meropenem.  there was a good correlation between bioluminescence and viable counts in determining the cell numbers in growing cultures of escherichia coli. cert was defined as the time required for the resumption of logarithmic growth and an increase of 1 log10 to occur over the pre-exposure inoculum in the test culture minus corresponding time for the control culture. pae and cert were studied on reference strains of enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at 4 x mic of meropenem the certs of these four gram-negative strains were 4.1, 4.9, 4.2, and 3.6 h, respectively, when assayed by bioluminescence. corresponding certs using viable counts were 4.2, 5.0, 5.1 and 3.8 h, respectively. in contrast to this good agreement between the methods in assessing cert, the corresponding paes were highly method dependent. at 4 x mic of meropenem the paes on e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa were 3.9, 4.8, 4.7, and 3.5 h, respectively, when assayed by bioluminescene. however, the corresponding and simultaneously determined viable count paes were -0.4, 0.5, -0.1, and 0.7 h, respectively. the poor correlation between these methods in assessing the pae is caused by greater initial decrease in viability compared with the less prominent initial change in cell density as measured by bioluminescence.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == pharmacodynamic effects of meropenem on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro initial killing and post-antibiotic effect (pae) of meropenem on five gram-negative reference strains were evaluated by bioluminescence assay of bacterial adenosine triphosphate (atp) and viable count. morphology studies were  performed in parallel. meropenem showed concentration-dependent long (2-5 h) paes on enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens when assayed by bioluminescence and induced spheroplasts at almost all concentrations. the bioluminescence paes reached a maximum response at 4 x mic. these paes of meropenem on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens were longer than corresponding paes of imipenem shown in previous studies. the higher affinity of meropenem than imipenem for pbp 3 might explain the longer paes obtained with meropenem. however, there was only a very short pae, no pae or even a negative pae when viable count was used as the initial value for the pae calculation. a strong initial decrease in viability but a less pronounced change in intracellular atp was registered. since this initial change in cell numbers is the initial value for the pae calculation, the length of pae was highly method dependent. in summary, a strong initial killing and no pae were shown using viable count as the initial value for the pae calculation, but a weak initial killing and long paes were shown when bioluminescence was used throughout the experiments.

TI  == fimh adhesin of type 1 pili is assembled into a fibrillar tip structure in the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == type 1 pili are heteropolymeric mannosebinding fibers produced by all members of  the enterobacteriaceae family. the bulk of the fiber is composed of fima. two macromolecular complexes responsible for mediating an interaction with mannose-containing receptors were purified from fima- escherichia coli by mannose affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. one complex contained only the mannose-binding adhesin, fimh, associated with fimg, a minor component of the type 1 pilus. in the other complex the fimg-fimh moiety was loosely associated with a chaperone-minor subunit complex (fimc-fimf), possibly representing an intermediate in tip fibrilla assembly. the fimc chaperone has also been shown to form a preassembly complex with fimh that has been purified and characterized previously. purified fimc did not bind to the fimg-fimh complex but did recognize fimh dissociated from the fimg-fimh complex. quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy revealed that the fimg-fimh complex had a thin fibrillar architecture. high-resolution electron microscopy of type 1 pili revealed that a 16-nm fibrillar tip structure with an architecture identical to that of the fimg-fimh complex was joined end-to-end to the pilus rod. in a fimh-  deletion mutant, the tip fibrillae joined to pilus rods were approximately 3 nm in length. the full-length tip fibrilla was restored by complementation with the  fimh gene in trans. the bipartite nature of the type 1 pilus was also demonstrated on pili purified from clinical isolates of members of the enterobacteriaceae family arguing that it is a conserved feature of the type 1 pilus.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

AB  == the in vitro activities of the carbapenem bms-181139 were determined in comparison with those of imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. bms-181139 was the most active against species of pseudomonas and related genera alteromonas and burkholderia, with mics for 147 of 149 isolates of < 4 micrograms/ml. of 22 imipenem-resistant (mic > 8 micrograms/ml) p. aeruginosa strains, only 1 required an mic of bms-181139 of > 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 14 requiring the same meropenem mic. bms-181139 was the most active carbapenem against the majority of other gram-negative species except members of the tribe proteeae, against which meropenem was more active. although imipenem was more active against gram-positive species, bms-18139 mics at which 90% of strain tested were inhibited were < 1 microgram/ml for these species. bms-181139 was generally active against isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin or broad-spectrum cephalosporins, including those containing plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases or high levels of chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases, as well as anaerobes except clostridium difficile. inoculum effects were noted for all three carbapenems against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens but  not escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or staphylococcus aureus. bms-181139's inoculum effect tended to be more marked. bms-181139 exhibited bactericidal activity at the mic for some strains and up to four to eight times the mic for others. the postantibiotic effect of bms-181139 was equal to or less  than that of imipenem and, like meropenem, exhibited intraspecies variability. bms-181139 was 30-fold more stable than imipenem and 7-fold more stable than meropenem to hydrolysis by hog kidney dehydropeptidase.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five mediterranean countries.
AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of 124 aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) were tested against 11 antimicrobial agents, including parenteral or oral cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. most sbp isolates were gram-negative organisms, and escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for 63% of the episodes evaluated. the fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) and the "fourth-generation" cephalosporin cefpirome were the most active agents against the gram-negative bacteria. commonly used cefotaxime and cefotaxime-desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx) combinations were also very active against gram-negative bacteria with only few enterobacter cloacae isolates being  resistant (minimum inhibitory concentrations > 32 micrograms/ml). all streptococci were susceptible to cefotaxime, cefpirome, and cefdaloxime and to the cefotaxime-des-ctx combinations, whereas only ofloxacin demonstrated acceptable activity against the enterococci. the widest spectrum of activity versus sbp isolates was found for ofloxacin (98% susceptibility) among the fluoroquinolones. for the beta-lactams, the widest spectrum of activity was demonstrated by cefpirome and the 2:1 cefotaxime-des-ctx combination (93% susceptibility). these results indicate that the role of ofloxacin and newer parenteral or orally administered cephalosporins in the treatment of prophylaxis  of sbp should be further evaluated.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfecting solutions incorporated into dental stone casts against a standard and representative group of microorganisms and to note changes in the physical properties of the casts. methods: irreversible hydrocolloid impressions were contaminated individually with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, actinobacter calcoaceticus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium phlei and candida albicans. four  readily available disinfecting solutions (glutaraldehyde, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite) were added to the die stone mix used to pour up the impressions. the set cast surfaces were swabbed at 1 h and 24 h, the  samples plated on agar and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h and 3 d for m. phlei. subsequently, colony forming units were counted. the physical properties assessed were setting time, setting expansion, compressive strength, detail reproduction and delayed expansion of the stone. results: only glutaraldehyde and povidone-iodine killed all contaminating microorganisms within 1 h, while the 1:5 dilution of sodium hypochlorite solution was equally effective after 24 h. two percent glutaraldehyde was the most effective disinfectant with the least adverse effects on the physical properties of the set cast. although povidone-iodine caused a decrease in the compressive strength of the set cast, it can be considered to be a sound alternative. significance: this study supports the concept of incorporating disinfectants into model stone as a standard operating procedure for impressions of unknown history and, most sensibly, all dental impressions.

AB  == a septicaemia klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from greece (ath1) was shown to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and cefoxitin and this resistance was not decreased in the presence of clavulanic acid. the gene coding  for the resistance phenotype, associated with a beta-lactamase showing cephalosporinase activity and a pi of 8.6, could be transferred into escherichia  coli k-12 by conjugation and transformation. dna-hybridisation showed that this gene was located on two different plasmids, 7.8 and 80 kb respectively. the larger, conjugative plasmid also carried genes coding for another beta-lactamase  (pi 6.6) and resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim. under highly stringent conditions the gene coding for the pi 8.6 beta-lactamase hybridised with chromosomal dna from citrobacter freundii os60 but not from e. coli or enterobacter cloacae. furthermore, the restriction map of this beta-lactamase gene corresponded to that of ampc from c. freundii os60. the  regulatory ampr gene could not be detected in the plasmid dna from the ath1 k. pneumoniae by dna hybridisation. the relationship between a plasmid-mediated extended spectrum beta-lactamase in a k. pneumoniae septicaemia isolate and chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase from c. freundii was demonstrated.

AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == gene sequence and biochemical characterization of fox-1 from klebsiella pneumoniae, a new ampc-type plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase with two molecular variants.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae ba32, a clinical isolate from buenos aires, argentina, was  found to produce a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase (fox-1) which conferred resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and cephamycins. resistance could be  transferred by conjugation or transformation into escherichia coli k-12 via a 48.5-kb plasmid (pglk1) that produced two fox-1 molecular variants with isoelectric points of 6.8 and 7.2 and apparent molecular sizes of 37 and 35 kda,  respectively. the kinetic study revealed that the two variants had very similar substrate and inhibition profiles. these values resemble those of chromosomally mediated class c (group 1) cephalosporinases. the structural gene of fox-1 (blafox-1) was cloned into a 2,270-bp psti-psti fragment and was expressed in e.  coli tg1. the deduced 382-amino-acid sequence of fox-1 exhibited a high degree of similarity with chromosomally encoded ampc beta-lactamases of pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, and citrobacter freundii. these findings suggest that fox-1 is a plasmid-mediated ampc-type beta-lactamase that is encoded by a single gene and that has two molecular variants.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == enhancement of microbiological safety levels of aseptically admixed total parenteral nutrition solutions through low-dose gamma irradiation.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the effect of low-dose gamma irradiation on aseptically admixed total parenteral nutrition (tpn) solutions to which large  inocula of three test bacterial species were added. microbiological safety levels were quantified in terms of sterility assurance levels (sals), indicating the probability of contamination occurring expressed as 10-n. the radiation sensitivity (d10 values) of test bacteria in tpn solutions inoculated with a series of bacteria recognized as common contaminants of these products, was determined. attainable sals of tpn solutions containing test bacteria were subsequently calculated from the d10 values. results showed that a minimum absorbed radiation dose as low as 1.5 kgy improved the sal of aseptically prepared tpn solutions from a probability value of 10(-3) to a value of less than 10(-8) for the microorganisms investigated. at an absorbed dose as high as 8.3 kgy, no measurable changes in amino acid, electrolyte, glucose and lipid components of the solutions were detected. these findings have important implications for the enhancement of microbiological safety levels of aseptically  prepared intravenous fluids in general.

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == the pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  == we examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to nagasaki university hospital during the past 15 years. a total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. the rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage i: 6.3%, stage ii: 15.9%, stage iii: 27.9%, and  stage iv: 33.8%). deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.

AB  == the prevalence of possible cross-transmission of selected bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci) among infected patients was evaluated in  five intensive care units (icus) over 6 months. a total of 284 isolates from clinical specimens were typed by plasmid profile analysis (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae), restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid dna (s. aureus), and/or pulse-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal dna (p. aeruginosa, enterococci, s. aureus, and other bacteria without plasmid dna). by typing criteria, only 13% of the 177 isolates obtained after > 2 days in an icu were classified as possibly cross-transmitted. many patients whose cultures yielded bacteria of an identical type may have been the sources rather than the recipients of these organisms. episodes of possible cross-transmission were scattered among all icus, usually affected only two patients, and were associated with most bacterial species. these data suggest that endemic bacterial cross-transmission in icus is relatively infrequent and that cross-transmitted bacteria are not common causes of endemic icu-related nosocomial infections.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

AB  == a 1954-bp dna fragment containing the blamox-1 gene, identified on a large resident plasmid (prmox-1) of klebsiella pneumoniae nu2936, was sequenced and an  open reading frame (orf) coding for a 390-amino-acid (aa) mox-1 was found. the total deduced aa sequence of mox-1 shared considerable homology with that of ampc-type class c beta-lactamases of gram- bacteria, especially of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 [51.3%; 63.8% at the nucleotide (nt) level]. however, the regulatory gene ampr and a 38-bp ampr-binding region were not present upstream from blamox-1, although the expression of p. aeruginosa ampc is directly regulated by ampr. possible -35 and -10 regions, a shine-dalgarno (sd) sequence and terminators were identified which are peculiar to blamox-1. on the other hand, a sequence highly homologous (91.6%) to the region upstream from dhfrx in the in7 integron carried by plasmid pdgo100 was found upstream from blamox-1 at nt 1 to 488. no significant difference was detected between the promoter activities of blamox-1 in ampd- and ampd+ strains of enterobacter cloacae, as measured by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) assay. these results clearly show that blamox-1 belongs to the group of ampc-related bla genes and that it is expressed constitutively, independently of transcriptional regulators  such as ampr, ampg and ampd. homology analysis among ampc enzymes or ampc genes implied that integration of the chromosomal ampc gene into a large resident plasmid, followed by transconjugation, was involved in the evolution of blamox-1.

TI  == genetics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == bacteria have adapted to the introduction of aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime,  ceftriaxone and other oxyimino-beta-lactams by altering existing plasmid-mediated class a and class d beta-lactamases so as to expand their spectrum of activity. in the tem and shv families of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, relative activity toward oxyimino-substrates increases with the number of amino acid substitutions but at the price of lowered intrinsic efficiency, so that compensatory up-promoter events are often associated with increased enzyme expression. another new mechanism of resistance is the capture on plasmids of normally chromosomal genes from enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii or pseudomonas aeruginosa, which upon transfer can provide klebsiella pneumoniae or  escherichia coli with resistance to alpha-methoxy-beta-lactams, such as cefoxitin or cefotetan, as well as to oxyimino-beta-lactams.

TI  == [staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. bacteriologic aspects].
AB  == struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria.  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. this trial examines the bacteriologic  aspects pre and post-eswl. eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (uti) were submitted to urine  cultures pre and post-eswl. the first 50 patients underwent during and post-eswl, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of  generalized sepsis. no patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. with respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-eswl uti, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a uti post-eswl. the distribution of organisms pre and post-eswl was as follows: proteus mirabilis (22/22), escherichia coli (11/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), enterobacter cloacae (0/1), alcaligenes odorans (1/2) enterococcus faecalis (1/3), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and candida albicans (1/1). in this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-eswl probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. according to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. in 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial  infection.

AB  == early bacterial pulmonary infections within 2 weeks after lung transplantation were studied in 29 patients undergoing surgery between december 1989 and may 1992. suspected pulmonary infections occurred in 11 patients (38 percent). the most common bacterial organisms isolated were klebsiella pneumoniae (45 percent;  5/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (36 percent; 4/11), escherichia coli (27 percent; 3/11), staphylococcus aureus (18 percent; 2/11), and enterobacter cloacae (18 percent; 2/11). the mortality due to infection was 3 percent (1/29) in the early  postoperative period. none of the following variables was found to be of prognostic significance: positive donor cultures, ischemic time of the graft, use of cardiopulmonary bypass, number of courses of methylprednisolone for acute rejection, duration of postoperative intubation, and type of surgical procedure.  the presence of infection in the early postoperative period did not influence long-term survival. in the absence of prognostic parameters, prompt adjustment of antibiotic therapy to the results of antibiograms remains the most important therapeutic step in the management of infections in the early postoperative period after lung transplantation.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical gram-positive  and gram-negative isolates. cefepime was active at low concentrations (mic50 values < or = 0.06 mg/l and mic90 values < or = 0.12 mg/l) against non-cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.). for klebsiella pneumoniae, mics were between 0.016 and 16 mg/l; the highest mic values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. against enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing enterobacter cloacae, mics were < or = 0.5 mg/l, but mics against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. ticarcillin-sensitive strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/l, while cefepime mics were 8-64 mg/l for strains resistant to ticarcillin. the cefepime mic50 value for haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/l. against methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus, cefepime mics were 0.5-16 mg/l; mics against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/l). against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime mic values were 0.03-16 mg/l; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains  were 2-128 mg/l. streptococci (groups a, c and g) were sensitive to cefepime with mics ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/l (mic50, 0.03 mg/l; mic90, 0.25 mg/l). the activity of cefepime against group b streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with mic50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively, and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. most enterococci and all listeria monocytogenes strains had mics > or = 32 mg/l.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == evaluation of a commercial dna purification system for plasmid analysis of nosocomial bacterial pathogens.
AB  == this study evaluated the promega magic minipreps (mm) (promega corporation, madison, wi) dna purification system for use in plasmid analysis of common nosocomial bacterial pathogens. the mm system is a kit that includes lysis solutions and buffers and incorporates a minicolumn of dna binding resin for recovery of plasmid dna. the mm system was used according to the manufacturer's directions to recover plasmids for agarose gel electrophoresis from clinical isolates of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae. for salmonella enteritidis and staphylococcus aureus, lysozyme and lysostaphin, respectively, were used for pretreatment. plasmid dna from ten isolates could be recovered in approximately one hour with very little manipulation and no phenol/chloroform extractions and was suitable for restriction endonuclease digestion. compared with a standard miniprep protocol, the mm system was much easier to perform and resulted in significant cost savings due to a 50% reduction in technologist time. the authors conclude that the mm system is a convenient and cost-effective method for clinical microbiology laboratories for recovering plasmid dna from nosocomial bacterial pathogens.

TI  == in vitro experiments on catheter-related infections due to gram-negative rods.
AB  == although many complications may arise with the use of central venous catheters, catheter-related bacteremia is considered to be the most serious complication. microflora on the patient's skin (coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus) is thought to represent the major source of microorganisms causing catheter-related infections. gram-negative rods are increasingly observed as causative agents. we therefore performed an in vitro study to elucidate the pathogenesis of polymer-associated infections caused by enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters and to study the resistance of polymer surface-grown gram-negative  rods against antibiotics. using a modification of the semiquantitative method for culturing vascular cannulas on solid media described by maki et al., we studied the adherence of various gram-negative rods to 1-cm segments of silastic catheters, a material used for port-a-cath-systems. organisms were obtained from  the american type culture collection (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae). all organisms but klebsiella showed extensive irreversible adherence. production of an extracellular slime substance was observed only with antimicrobially treated pseudomonas. after 'infection', the silastic catheter segments were treated with  various antimicrobial agents. the following antibiotics were used either individually or in combination: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. despite the fact that the antibiotic concentrations used were many times greater than the respective mics of the various antibiotics, none of the antibiotics tested succeeded in eliminating the organisms. e. coli was found  to be the most susceptible organism. these in vitro data substantiate our clinical impression that it is hardly possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters with gram-negative rods by using the antimicrobial agents employed here.

TI  == ex vivo pharmacodynamic study of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam, compared with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid.
AB  == ten volunteers received piperacillin (4 g), piperacillin (4 g) plus tazobactam (0.5 g) (tazocin), and ticarcillin (3 g) plus clavulanic acid (0.2 g) (timentin)  intravenously over 30 min in a cross-over blinded scheme. blood samples were obtained 0.5 and 3 h after the end of infusion to measure by (high-pressure liquid chromatography) the concentration and bactericidal titers against 70 gram-negative bacilli. serum time-kill curves were done against 35 strains to measure killing rates and area under the time-kill curve. using the measure of serum bactericidal activity, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam were equally effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and bacteroides fragilis. piperacillin-tazobactam was superior to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against piperacillin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (4 to 16 times) and s. marcescens (2 to 4 times). by using the area under the time-kill curve, piperacillin-tazobactam was equivalent to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against piperacillin-susceptible strains; piperacillin-tazobactam was significantly more  active than piperacillin against piperacillin-resistant strains and was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanic acid when the sample obtained 3 h after the end of infusion to volunteers was considered. serum piperacillin concentrations (mean +/- standard error of the mean; in mg/liter) were 115 +/- 13 at 0.5 h and 7.4 +/- 1.4 at 3 h after the administration of piperacillin alone and 105.5 +/- 12.6 (0.5 h) and 7.7 +/- 1.6 after the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam. serum tazobactam concentrations (in milligram per liter) were 13.1 +/- 1.4 at 0.5 h and 1.2 +/- 0.2 at 3 h. the piperacillin-tazobactam ratio was 8 +/- 0.3 at 0.5  h and 6.2 +/- 0.5 at 3 h. piperacillin-tazobactam appears promising against beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == between april and october 1990, photosensitivity reactions were observed in 19 out of 338 patients who were administered lomefloxacin (lflx) for the treatment of urinary tract infections (uti) in our hospital. to certify the effectiveness and safety of lflx to uti, we carried out a controlled study with fixed dosages and durations. patients with acute uncomplicated uti and chronic complicated uti  were enrolled and lflx dosages of 200 mg b.i.d. for 7 days and 14 days, respectively, were administered. the overall efficacy rates were 100% and 84% respectively. concerning the bacteriological effect, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated in every case, while 3 strains of enterococcus faecalis 2 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain of enterobacter cloacae persisted. no photosensitivity reaction or noteworthy severe adverse reactions were observed among 200 cases enrolled in this study of restricted dosages and durations. we, urologists, need to be well-informed about  photosensitivity reactions induced by quinolone antimicrobial agents. lflx was proven to be effective in uti without showing any photosensitivity reactions when administered by our fixed dosages and durations.

TI  == controlled clinical comparison of two lysis-based blood culture systems, isolator and septi-chek release, for detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  == a controlled clinical comparison was made of the isolator (wampole laboratories,  cranbury, n.j.) and the septi-chek release bottle (roche diagnostics, nutley, n.j.). from 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to centers for disease control definitions. statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the isolator system: staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.0001), alcaligenes xylosoxidans (p = 0.008), klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.05), salmonella spp. (p = 0.03), and candida albicans (p = 0.02). the septi-chek release system required a longer period of time than the isolator system for detection of the following organisms:s. aureus (p = 0.0001), enterococcus spp. (p = 0.0001), enterobacter cloacae (p = 0.03), escherichia coli (p = 0.0001), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.03), k. pneumoniae (p = 0.02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.002), and c. albicans (p = 0.005). there were 430 episodes of bloodstream  infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to s. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (p = 0.0001) by the isolator system than by the septi-chek release system. however, episodes of bloodstream infections due to s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus spp., and e. coli were detected significantly faster by the isolator system.

TI  == the north american component (the united states and canada) of an international comparative mic trial monitoring ofloxacin resistance.
AB  == common lots of reference mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in february-april 1992. five medical centers in the united states and canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). quality-control strains were processed concurrently, mics recorded, and data processed at a common location. selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and p. aeruginosa; (d) cross  resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.

TI  == bacterial flora detected of the uterine endometrial cavity of diabetic patients with myoma uteri.
AB  == patients with diabetes frequently suffer from various postoperative complications, especially infection. diabetic patients also have a high incidence of uterine endometrial cancer. the nature of the intrauterine bacterial flora may be related to both infection and carcinogenesis. therefore, identification of the intrauterine bacterial flora in diabetic patients may be useful. bacteria were detected in the uterine endometrial cavity of 100% of ten diabetic patients with  myoma uteri. however, among 20 non-diabetic control patients with myoma uteri, only three 15% harbored bacteria. members of the enterobacteriaceae (escherichia  coli, proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) were the predominant bacteria. we speculate that bacterial products contribute to carcinogenesis, as has been proposed for colon carcinoma. antimicrobial agents active against enterobacteriaceae should be used to prevent postoperative infections in gynecologic procedures in diabetic patients.

TI  == emergence of resistance to imipenem in enterobacter isolates masquerading as klebsiella pneumoniae during therapy with imipenem/cilastatin.
AB  == clinical isolates identified as klebsiella pneumoniae by the vitek, enterotube ii, and api 20e systems were recovered from a patient undergoing therapy with imipenem/cilastatin. these isolates were resistant to multiple beta-lactam agents, and some were even resistant to imipenem. analysis revealed a bush group  1 beta-lactamase, and imipenem resistance corresponded to the loss of outer-membrane proteins in strains expressing high levels of this beta-lactamase. further characterization efforts yielded abnormal but positive results of tests for ornithine decarboxylase production and motility, and chromosomal homology to  an enterobacter cloacae ampr, ampc probe was detected. these results suggested that the organisms were actually of an enterobacter species, perhaps enterobacter aerogenes. cefoxitin resistance may be a useful marker for preventing this misidentification in the future; misidentification of such organisms poses a hazard, as it may lead to inappropriate beta-lactam therapy for infections caused by organisms that have the potential for resistance due to inducible group 1 cephalosporinases.

TI  == identification of a novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase with chromosomal cephalosporinase characteristics from klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == a clinical isolate of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to a wide variety of beta-lactams, including third generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and cephamycins, as well as to beta-lactam/clavulanate and sulbactam combinations was examined. it was found that this resistance was transmissible to escherichia coli recipients via a small 5.3 mda plasmid encoding for an unusual beta-lactamase produced in relatively large quantities. the enzyme, designated lat-1, exhibited  a highly basic isoelectric point (pi = 9.4) and its hydrolytic activity resembled closely that of a class-i chromosomal cephalosporinase. in vitro, lat-1 hydrolysed cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin more rapidly than penicillins. a slow hydrolysis of cefoxitin, ceftibuten, ceftazidime and cefotaxime was also observed. the enzyme was inhibited by low concentrations of aztreonam and cloxacillin but it was virtually unaffected by clavulanate. under stringent conditions, the lat-1 encoding plasmid did not hybridize with probes specific for tem-1 and enterobacter cloacae ampc beta-lactamase genes. the plasmid was not self-transferable but was readily mobilized by a conjugative r-plasmid harboured by the same k. pneumoniae strain.

TI  == bacterial load of cockroaches in relation to urban environment.
AB  == sanitation is an important problem in relation to the control of pests in urban environments. this investigation analysed the potential risk related to the presence of cockroaches and their capacity for disseminating bacteria in six different types of buildings: hospital nursing area and out-patient area, swimming-pool pool-side and toilet area, low-income flats and food-handling places. fifty-six species of bacteria were identified from 157 samples, 14 of these have previously been reported as potentially pathogenic for man and vertebrates. similarities were found between samples collected in (a) the hospital out-patient area and food-handling establishments and (b) the hospital nursing area and flats. pool-sides possessed a poorer bacterial flora. there was  a greater bacterial specific diversity in food-handling establishments, flats and swimming-bath toilet area. enterobacter cloacae. klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca were dominant species in flats and the hospital nursing area.  therefore, cockroaches can play a role in disseminating bacteria, which they can  carry passively on their cuticle.

TI  == effect of antibiotics on endotoxin release from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotics may inhibit bacterial growth or may kill bacteria by inhibiting cell  wall synthesis or protein synthesis. the amount of endotoxin released during antibiotic action has been found to be clinically important. nine antibiotics, representing seven classes, were studied for the amounts of endotoxin released during their action on susceptible strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. staphylococcus aureus, which produces no endotoxin, was used as a control organism. aztreonam induced the highest release of endotoxin, whereas other antibiotics such as imipenem and the quinolones induced the lowest release of endotoxin. although the quantities of endotoxin released are not easily explained from the established mechanisms of antibiotic action, our findings may have implications for therapy of the acutely ill, septic patient in whom release of large quantities of endotoxin may be catastrophic.

AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

AB  == beta-lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the microbiology laboratory of the royal london hospital. this survey, performed between january and april, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. the distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. this increase was balanced by a decreased proportion  of enterobacteria. amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, tem-1 (especially),  tem-2, shv-1 and oxa types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. their frequency in escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst proteus mirabilis isolates. an apparent decrease in their frequency amongst enterobacter cloacae isolates, from  48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of p. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. in the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of e. cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii, and in 2/170 p. aeruginosa isolates. these proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (p approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were  found in 11/70 klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced tem-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified shv-derived enzyme.

TI  == microorganisms associated with natural fermentation of prosopis africana seeds for the production of okpiye.
AB  == okpiye is a food condiment prepared by the fermentation of prosopis africana seeds. the traditional process for the production and microbiological characteristics of the condiment were investigated. during laboratory fermentation that lasted 96 h, the mesquite seeds underwent a natural fermentation that was characterised by the growth of microorganisms to 10(6)-10(8) cfu/g. several species of bacteria especially b. subtilis, b. licheniformis, b. megaterium, staphylococcus epidermidis and micrococcus spp were found to be the most actively involved organisms. however, significant contributions to the microbial ecology were made by enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. lactobacillus spp were present in low numbers towards the  end of the fermentation. the presence of proteus and pseudomonas spp in traditional fermented samples demonstrate the variability which may exist in the  microflora of individual fermented samples. variations in the important microbial groups show that bacillus spp were the most prevalent species and occurred until  the end of fermentation. temperature, ph and titratable acidity varied with time  and were influenced by the metabolic activities of the microorganisms.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

TI  == changing patterns of blood culture isolates from patients with acute leukemia: a  review of twenty years' experience.
AB  == during the 20-year period, 1972-1991, 286 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 200  (45%) of 445 patients with acute leukemia in a hematology ward, giving an incidence of 482 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. the frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. this was opposite to the decreased frequencies of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the isolates of p. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, staphylococcus aureus  were ranked as major pathogens. among the recent isolates of s. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. therefore, until more effective means for control of p. aeruginosa bacteremia in  particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.

TI  == [synergistic action of cefodizime with other antimicrobial agents on clinically isolated microorganisms. ii. synergistic action with sisomicin].
AB  == cefodizime (cdzm) possesses a broad antimicrobial spectrum and a relatively long  half life in the blood. in addition, it shows excellent therapeutic efficacies in the treatment of infections in leukopenic animal models, hence it is expected that cdzm may have good efficacies against various infections in immunocompromised hosts. in the meantime, sisomicin (siso) not only has strong antibacterial activities against gram-negative rods (gnr), but has relatively low nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. thus, we examined antibacterial effectiveness of  the combination of cdzm and siso against clinical isolates in vitro. 1. antibacterial effects of cdzm+siso combination were examined using siso susceptible strains of escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. observations that the combination of the 2 drugs showed fic indices between less than 0.5-less than 1.0 against most of these strains at siso concentrations of 1 mic or sub mic levels strongly  suggested the presence of a synergistic action between the 2 drugs against siso susceptible strains of gnr. 2. of the strains tested, 10% of c. freundii, 6.7% of e. cloacae, 63.3% of s. marcescens, 23.3% of p. vulgaris and 18.0% of p. aeruginosa were found to be resistant to siso, and little synergistic effect of the 2 drugs was observed against these strains. 3. as the synergistic effect of the 2 drugs against gnr was observed against siso susceptible strains including those which were resistant to cdzm, but not against those strains which were resistant to siso, it seems reasonable to conclude that the appearance of the synergistic effect between the 2 drugs depends on the activity of siso.

AB  == bismuth subsalicylate (bss), sodium salicylate, and bismuth nitrate were compared with respect to their effects on capsular polysaccharide (cps) production, bacterial growth inhibition, and potentiation of aminoglycoside inhibition on strains of gram-negative bacteria. at 250 microm, bss reduced cps production in klebsiella pneumoniae cultures by greater than 90% in contrast to a 36% reduction by salicylate. at 500 microm, salicylate reduced cps by 52%, versus a 70% reduction by bismuth nitrate. substantial reduction of cps production by bss occurred before bacterial growth inhibition was observed. however, bss at 250 microm decreased cell viability by 21%, and at 1 mm by 50%. bismuth nitrate was equally inhibitory to cell growth. salicylate at 1 mm did not affect bacterial cell counts. the susceptibility of selected gram-negative bacteria to aminoglycoside antibiotics was studied in the presence of bss or salicylate. generally, salicylate at 2.5 mm reduced the concentration of aminoglycoside required to inhibit culture growth for 24 h (ic24) by two-fold. in contrast, 700  microm bss reduced the ic24 for amikacin four-fold for a resistant k. pneumoniae  strain. at 500 microm, bss reduced the ic24 of gentamicin seven-fold for salmonella typhimurium. inhibitory concentrations of amikacin or tobramycin for enterobacter cloacae or serratia marcescens were also reduced seven-fold with 500 microm bss. bismuth nitrate reduced the ic24 of tobramycin by four-fold for e. cloacae. thus, the profound effects of bss on cps production and aminoglycoside potentiation were due to the additive effects of bismuth and salicylate ions, whilst its effects on growth inhibition were due to the bismuth ion.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. a study mainly focused on imipenem. the research group for testing imipenem susceptibilities of clinical isolates].
AB  == we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1989. the susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and xanthomonas maltophilia. ipm has been found to have activities  superior to those of other antibiotics tested against e. faecalis, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis. no antibiotics tested showed good activities against mrsa except minocycline.

TI  == drug treatment of pneumonia in the hospital. what are the choices?
AB  == mortality and morbidity of nosocomial pneumonia remain high. successful treatment of pulmonary infections depends on several factors including type of infection, offending pathogen, status of host defences, and adequate choice of antibiotic therapy. the physician's decision should aim at achieving antibiotic concentrations beyond the mic at the site of infection. gram-negative bacilli, notably pseudomonos aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli, remain the most frequent agents in nosocomial pneumonia. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae predominate among the gram-positive cocci. pneumocystis carinii predominates in immunocompromised patients. protected sample bronchoscopy associated with quantitative cultures of samples, and quantification of intracellular microorganisms in cells recovered by broncho-alveolar lavage are two promising procedures which might replace previous, more aggressive methods. penetration of antibiotics into lung tissue depends on physicochemical properties of the drug and the degree of inflammation of lung tissue. quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim penetrate well into bronchial secretions. penetration is moderate to low for aminoglycosides and beta-lactams.  fluoroquinolones and new beta-lactam agents, including third-generation cephalosporins imipenem, aztreonam and ticarcillin-clavulanate, showed comparative clinical efficacy in treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, with an efficacy rate close to 80%. aminoglycosides should not be used alone. combination therapy reduces but does not eliminate the risk of selection of gram-negative resistant mutants. it should not be used routinely except for p. aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens infections.

TI  == post-antibiotic effect of beta-lactam antibiotics on gram-negative bacteria in relation to morphology, initial killing and mic.
AB  == the in vitro post-antibiotic effect (pae) of cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and imipenem on reference strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens were evaluated by bioluminescence assay of bacterial atp. in parallel with the pae determination, initial killing and morphology studies were performed. imipenem produced greater than 1 h pae on all strains tested, cefepime and cefotaxime on four strains and ceftazidime only on one of the strains tested. the length of the pae on different strains did not correlate in the same way to mic. imipenem induced greater than 1 h pae at 1/4-2 mic while the cephalosporins caused greater than 1 h pae at 4-256 x mic. a pae exceeding 1.2h was seen concomitantly with spheroplasts but there was not necessarily strong (greater than or equal to 99%)  initial killing at the same time. the pae duration at greater than or equal to 99% initial killing varied between 2.0 h and 5.0 h. when the cephalosporins produced less than 1 h paes, this was seen concomitantly with production on filaments and weak initial killing. the bioluminescence method was not jeopardized by filament formation and no negative pae was found in contrast to the viable count method. the study showed that neither a certain multiple of mic, the presence of spheroplasts nor strong initial killing can predict the length of pae for beta-lactam antibiotics on gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [desiccated rattlesnake capsules: a potential source of gram-negative bacterial infection].
AB  == the ingestion of rattlesnake powder capsules is frequent in mexico in view of their alleged curative properties in various diseases, among them different malignancies. based on previous reports showing both bacteremia and septicemia in patients with malignant diseases ingesting such capsules, we conducted a study to evaluate the presence of microorganisms in 16 different preparations of rattlesnake powder capsules, obtained in six different cities of our country. we  found that all the samples were significantly contaminated with gram-negative coliform bacteria: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, e. cloacae, salmonella arizona and salmonella of groups b, e4 and g. eighty one percent of the capsules were contaminated with salmonella sp. the most frequent was s. arizona with a natural reservoir in snakes. contamination was probably derived from both the flesh of the snake and fecal contamination during  the domestic preparation of the powder to produce the capsules. these data, together with those previously published regarding bacteremia and septicemia derived from the ingestion of the capsules, suggests that there is danger in their use.

TI  == comparative study of pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity of ceftizoxime and cefotaxime.
AB  == single 2-g intravenous doses of ceftizoxime (czx) and cefotaxime (ctx) were given over 30 min to 10 adult volunteers in a crossover manner on two separate occasions. concentrations of czx, ctx, and the primary metabolite of ctx, desacetylcefotaxime (dctx), in serum, suction-induced-blister fluid, and urine were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by using an extended least-squares modeling program (mkmodel). czx exhibited a half-life in serum (2.05 h) longer than that of ctx (1.43 h) but comparable to that of dctx (2.02 h). the percentage of penetration in blister fluid, estimated by area under the curve ratios, was significantly higher for czx (164.4%) than for ctx (60.8%). serum bactericidal activity, determined for volunteer samples at 1, 6, 8, and 12 h after patients were dosed,  against clinical isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and morganella morganii were significantly higher for czx than those for ctx against members of the family enterobacteriaceae at all times. serum bactericidal titers against b. fragilis were also higher for czx than for ctx at 1 h postinfusion. neither czx nor ctx exhibited any bactericidal activity at any other time against the b. fragilis group. in conclusion, the serum bactericidal activity of czx was greater and more-prolonged than that of ctx against tested strains in spite of the in vitro synergistic contribution of dctx to ctx, equal serum elimination half-lives of dctx and czx, and similar antibacterial activity and similar instability under microbiological testing for czx and ctx.

AB  == sorghum flour obtained from sudan was mixed with water in a 1:2 (wt/vol) ratio and fermented at 30 degrees c for 24 h. the bacterial populations increased with  fermentation time and reached a plateau at approximately 18 h. at the end of 24 h, sorghum batter ph had dropped from 5.95 to 3.95 and the batter had a lactic acid content of 0.80%. the microbial population during the 24 h of fermentation consisted of bacteria (pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus confusus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus sp., erwinia ananas, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae), yeasts (candida intermedia and debaryomyces hansenii), and molds (aspergillus sp., penicillium sp., fusarium sp., and rhizopus sp.). p.  pentosaceus was the dominant microorganism at the end of the 24-h fermentation. when three consecutive fermentations using an inoculum from the previous fermentation were carried out, the bacterial population increase plateaued at 9 h. the microbial populations in these fermentations were dominated by p. pentosaceus.

TI  == cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), klebsiella spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., and salmonella spp.  this antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter spp., and morganella morganii. cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group a, b, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 less than 0.015 mg/l). the mics of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with mics below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. the frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. in this study isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. type 3, p, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. the klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. also, both type 3 and escherichia coli p fimbrial genotypes  were detected by using dna colony blot assays. the frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: enterobacter (38.6%), klebsiella (26.8%), serratia (17.7%), e. coli (13%), and proteus (5.2%). isolates of klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. the phenotype and genotype for e. coli p fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. in addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of enterobacter aerogenes. finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among k. oxytoca and proteus mirabilis isolates. the frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role  for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.

TI  == antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  == amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. a total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested  for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in proteus mirabilis to 100% in klebsiella pneumoniac. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. for beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the mics of amoxicillin prominently in strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae and bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. their mic50s, mic90s and geometric means of mics all decreased 4 folds or greater. for beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the mics did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, proteus vulgaris and e. cloacae.

TI  == growth kinetics of coliform bacteria under conditions relevant to drinking water  distribution systems.
AB  == the growth of environmental and clinical coliform bacteria under conditions typical of drinking water distribution systems was examined. four coliforms (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae) were isolated from an operating drinking water system for study; an enterotoxigenic e. coli strain and clinical isolates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli were also used. all but one of the coliforms tested were capable of growth in unsupplemented mineral salts medium; the environmental isolates had greater specific growth rates than did the clinical isolates. this trend was maintained when the organisms were grown with low levels (less than 1 mg liter-1) of yeast extract. the environmental k. pneumoniae isolate had a greater yield, higher specific growth rates, and a lower ks value than the other organisms. the  environmental e. coli and the enterotoxigenic e. coli strains had comparable yield, growth rate, and ks values to those of the environmental k. pneumoniae strain, and all three showed significantly more successful growth than the clinical isolates. the environmental coliforms also grew well at low temperatures on low concentrations of yeast extract. unsupplemented distribution water from the collaborating utility supported the growth of the environmental isolates. growth of the k. pneumoniae water isolate was stimulated by the addition of autoclaved biofilm but not by tubercle material. these findings indicate that growth of environmental coliforms is possible under the conditions found in operating municipal drinking water systems and that these bacteria could be used  in tests to determine assimilable organic carbon in potable water.

TI  == concomitant dissemination of three extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among different enterobacteriaceae isolated in a french hospital.
AB  == from january 1988 to august 1989, 267 non-repetitive strains of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbla) derived from tem (ctx-1/tem-3, caz-6) or shv (caz-5) were isolated from 219 colonized or  infected patients. esblas were characterized by analytical isoelectric focusing.  biotypes, resistance phenotypes and plasmid patterns were determined in order to  differentiate the isolates in each species. among the 116 ctx-1-producing enterobacteriaceae, 48 strains were differentiated: 27 from 74 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, seven from 22 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, and 14 from a combined total of seven k. oxytoca, five serratia marcescens, six escherichia coli, 1 enterobacter cloacae and 1 citrobacter freundii. caz-5 has been isolated  since january 1988 in 16 different strains among 101 k. pneumoniae isolates. caz-6 was first identified in k. pneumoniae (january 1988). among the 48 enterobacteriaceae producing caz-6, 12 strains were differentiated: four from 39  e. aerogenes isolates, three from four k. pneumoniae, and five from a combined total of two s. marcescens, two e. coli and one e. cloacae. during this outbreak, ctx-1 was found to be encoded by 85 kb (inc 7/m) or greater than or equal to 150  kb (inc 6/c) plasmids. caz-6 was always encoded by an 85 kb (inc 7/m) plasmid and caz-5 by a greater than 150 kb plasmid. these results show that strain epidemics  and plasmid dissemination occurred mainly in k. pneumoniae and e. aerogenes for ctx-1, in e. aerogenes for caz-6, and in k. pneumoniae for caz-5. they also suggest that the bla(tem) gene (ctx-1) has spread between different plasmids present in the same ecosystem.

TI  == in vitro activity of an oxycephem ocp 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  == ocp 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at c-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at c-3. ocp 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog me 1228 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia  stuartii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. activity against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was equivalent. ocp 9-176 was twofold less active than me-1228 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. activity of the two agents was similar against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. although ocp 9-176 inhibited e. coli containing tem-1 and tem-2, it was less active than me-1228. klebsiella organisms with shv-1 and k-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but tem-3-containing isolates had mics of 16  micrograms/ml. ocp 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by tem-1, pse-1, k-1, and p99,  and it was a poor inhibitor of p99. replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at c-3.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  == cefpirome (cpr, hr 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. cpr was very active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae among gram-positive cocci. antibacterial activities of cpr were also strong against branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, salmonella sp., klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa among gram-negative rods. 2. the plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the t 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and t 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. the urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for cpr. 4. clinical efficacies of cpr were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. in bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. as side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of got, gpt and triglyceride. these findings indicate that cpr will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of gr69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  == gr69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (mic90). it had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and e-1040. against cephalosporinase-producing enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens, mics ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and  cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to gr69153, and for this organism the mic90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the e-1040 mic90, but most pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. gr69153 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. for staphylococcus aureus gr69153 mics were similar to those of ceftazidime and e-1040. enterococci and listeriae were resistant to gr69153, but streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. the activity of gr69153 was not affected by serum. gr69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, and bro-1, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-9, and morganellae. gr69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. it is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. gr69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.

TI  == intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
AB  == intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (uti). patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. patients with uti were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. for patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus species, acinetobacter species, and k. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. infections by enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. for uti patients, e. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. all 14 uti patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. in the  ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by enterococcus species, and  in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by enterococcus species and one by enterobacter cloacae. intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.

TI  == production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11.
AB  == a monoclonal antibody (mab 4e8c12) specific for escherichia coli o157:h7 and o26:h11 was produced by immunizing balb/c mice with a rough strain of e. coli o157:h7. the antibody reacted strongly by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with each of 36 strains of e. coli o157:h7. no cross-reactivity was observed with strains of salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, shigella dysenteriae, proteus spp., escherichia hermanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, aeromonas hydrophila, and all except five strains of e. coli other than serotype o157:h7 (including strains of serotype o157 but not h7). the e. coli strains (all of serotype o26:h11) that reacted with the antibody were enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) that were isolated from patients with hemolytic  uremic syndrome or hemorrhagic colitis and produced verotoxin similar to that of  e. coli o157:h7. mab 4e8c12 belongs to the subclass immunoglobulin g2a and has a  kappa light chain. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of e. coli of different serotypes followed by western immunoblot analysis revealed that mab 4e8c12 reacted specifically with two proteins of ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11 with apparent molecular weights of 5,000 to 6,000. these proteins appeared to be  markers specific for ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11. this mab, because of its specificity, may be a useful reagent of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of these types of ehec isolates in clinical and food specimens.

TI  == in vitro effect of chlorhexidine and amikacin on oral gram-negative bacilli from  bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == prophylactic use of chlorhexidine (chx) mouthrinses has been shown to benefit the oral health status of bone marrow transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed persons and to reduce systemic complications of oral origin. however, a problem that often emerges with these patients is oropharyngeal and lower respiratory tract colonization by opportunistic aerobic or facultative gram-negative bacilli (gnb). trends in four studies indicated that chx rinses may predispose these persons to oral colonization by gnb such as the enterobacteria,  klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. since gnb are generally susceptible to broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotics such as amikacin, the in vitro sensitivities of k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli atcc reference strains and k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae oral clinical isolates to combinations of chx and amikacin were determined by means of a disk diffusion sensitivity assay on mueller-hinton agar. the amikacin minimum inhibitory concentrations for all gnb tested were much lower (less than or equal  to 4.69 to less than or equal to 9.37 micrograms/ml) than those for chx (less than or equal to 18.75 to less than or equal to 300 micrograms/ml), and combinations of chx and amikacin gave larger growth inhibition zones than chx alone. no antibacterial antagonism between chx and amikacin was found, and their  solubilities were compatible. therefore use of topical amikacin in conjunction with chx rinses may reduce oral colonization by gnb in severely immunocompromised patient populations.

TI  == novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase (mir-1) conferring resistance to oxyimino-  and alpha-methoxy beta-lactams in clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from 11 patients at the miriam hospital were identified as resistant to cefoxitin and ceftibuten as well as to aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. resistance could be transferred by conjugation or transformation with plasmid dna into escherichia coli and was due to the production of a beta-lactamase with an isoelectric point of 8.4 named mir-1. in e. coli, mir-1 conferred resistance to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftibuten, ceftriaxone, and such alpha-methoxy beta-lactams as cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, and moxalactam. in vitro, mir-1 hydrolyzed cephalothin and  cephaloridine much more rapidly than it did penicillin g, ampicillin, or carbenicillin. cefotaxime was hydrolyzed at 10% the rate of cephaloridine. cefoxitin inactivation could only be detected by a microbiological test. the inhibition profile of mir-1 was similar to that of chromosomally mediated class i beta-lactamases. potassium clavulanate had little effect on cefoxitin or cefibuten resistance and was a poor inhibitor of mir-1 activity. cefoxitin or imipenem did not induce mir-1. the gene determining mir-1 was cloned on a 1.4-kb  acci-psti fragment. under stringent conditions, probes for tem-1 and shv-1 genes  and the e. coli ampc gene failed to hybridize with the mir-1 gene. however, a provisional sequence of 150 bp of the mir-1 gene proved to be 90% identical to the sequence of ampc from enterobacter cloacae but only 71% identical to that of  e. coli, thus explaining the lack of hybridization to the e. coli ampc probe. plasmid profiles of the 11 k. pneumoniae clinical isolates were not identical, but each contained a plasmid from 40 to 60 kb that hybridized with the cloned mir-1 gene. both transfer-proficient and transfer-deficient mir-1 plasmids belonged to the n incompatibility group. thus, the resistance of these k. pneumoniae strains was the result of plasmid acquisition of a class i beta-lactamase, a new resistance determinant that expands the kinds of beta-lactam resistance capable of spread by plasmid dissemination among clinical  isolates.

AB  == 653 11 beer mugs rinsed mechanically by conveyor belt dishwashing machines and 182 mugs cleaned in open vats were investigated for their content of faecal and total coliforms. ten and more faecal coliform germs could be detected in 4.7% of  the mechanically rinsed tankards and in 12.1% of those cleaned in open vats. respectively, ten and more total coliforms were found in 30.3% and in 67.6%. altogether 213 coliform strains as defined by the german drinking water regulation were characterised biochemically by the api 20 e-system and by their susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents. a total of 19 different species from eight genera could be differentiated, whereas 12 strains were unidentifiable by the applied system. klebsiella oxytoca was the most frequently encountered germ,  followed by enterobacter cloacae, k. pneumoniae and ent. sakazakii. 59 of the 213 strains were fully susceptible to all antibiotics used. 44 strains, however, revealed complete or moderate resistance against three and more agents. these results indicate that unhygienic dishwashing procedures may play a decisive role  in the epidemiology of clinically relevant and multiresistant germs.

TI  == [piperacillin-amikacin combinations: killing curves].
AB  == bactericidal activity as a function of time of piperacillin (pip) and amikacin (akn) alone and in combination was evaluated by killing curves technique on 23 clinical isolates: e. coli (6), k. pneumoniae (5), e. cloacae (6) and p. aeruginosa (6), for which the minimal inhibitory concentrations ranges of piperacillin were 0.25 to 64 mg/l and of amikacin 1 to 8 mg/l. for each species,  the strains were chosen according to the most frequent phenotypes: beta-lactams susceptible, penicillinase (pase), cephalosporinase (case) and pase + case producers. killing curves were carried out with the following concentrations (mg/l): piperacillin (2, 16, 64); amikacin (4, 8, 16); piperacillin (2) + amikacin (4); piperacillin (16) + amikacin (8); piperacillin (64) + amikacin (16). antibiotic concentrations corresponded to pharmacokinetics and/or to critical values of piperacillin and amikacin. bactericidal activity was defined as a 4 log 10 decrease in cfu/ml between 2 and 24 hours. when piperacillin (64) was combined with amikacin (16), the bactericidal effects were nearly the same as those with amikacin alone. but piperacillin (16) + amikacin (8) combination had bactericidal effect for the majority of strains (21/23) and it prevented for some of them the bacterial regrowth observed with amikacin alone at the same concentration. a bactericidal activity without regrowth (until the 24th hour) was obtained for 9 strains; 2 susceptible e. coli, 3 k. pneumoniae (chromosomal pase  producer) and 4 cefotaxime susceptible e. cloacae, with low dose combination piperacillin (2) + amikacin (4). finally, only combinations piperacillin (64) + amikacin (16) or piperacillin (16) + amikacin (8) had bactericidal activity on 2  ticarcillin-resistant p. aeruginosa, the two antibiotics being separatedly bacteriostatic.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a prospective study of long-term use of amikacin in a paediatrics department. indications, administration, side-effects, bacterial isolates and resistance.
AB  == amikacin (amikin; b-m) was used as the only aminoglycoside for 18 months in a paediatric department within a general hospital because of high levels of resistance of klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae isolates to tobramycin, gentamicin and netilmicin. between 1 february 1987 and 31 july 1988, 816 children were treated with a slow intravenous injection at a standardised dose adjusted for weight and age. respiratory disease was present in 35.8% of 537 neonates, 56.4% of 190 infants and 70.9% of 89 older  children. escherichia coli (65 isolates), klebsiella species (59 isolates), enterobacter species (26 isolates) and p. aeruginosa (22 isolates) constituted the most common gram-negative pathogens. the positive blood culture yield was 7.8%. satisfactory median peak and trough serum amikacin levels were achieved. no significant renal side-effects were noted. severe bilateral hearing loss in 1 low-birthweight infant resulted from inadvertent overdosage. at the end of this 18-month surveillance period 97.7% of e. coli, 98.6% of k. pneumoniae, 96.3% of e. cloacae, and 98.0% of p. aeruginosa isolates remained sensitive to amikacin, while resistance of k. pneumoniae to tobramycin, netilmicin and gentamicin decreased significantly (p less than 0.003, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.007 respectively; chi-square test).

TI  == hemolysin as a marker for serratia.
AB  == all serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. dna fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal dna of s. marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. kiliensis, s. grimesii, s. proteamaculans, s. plymutica, s. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. the restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. s. ficaria and s. marinorubra expressed  a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the s. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. the dna of the latter strains did not hybridize with the s. marcescens hemolysin dna probes. some s. marcescens strains, s. kiliensis and s. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. no hybridization was found with dna of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella arerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosus, listeria sp.,  aeromonas sp., legionella sp. and a meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin dna probes are specific for serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than serratia.

TI  == therapeutic effects of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin, on various models of infections in mice and rats.
AB  == cefpirome (hr 810) is a new cephalosporin with a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain. it was compared with other cephem antibiotics in protective and therapeutic effects on various experimental infections, systemic and local, in mice and rats. hr 810 had more potent protective effect than ceftazidime (caz), cefoperazone (cpz), and cefotaxime (ctx) on systemic infections induced by escherichia coli ec-31, staphylococcus aureus smith, and serratia marcescens sm-6 in mice. against systemic infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa hr 810 was as effective as caz. mice with leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide were systemically infected with methicillin-resistant s. aureus  (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and enterococcus faecalis. hr 810 was superior to cefuzonam (czon) and cefmetazole against mrsa and mssa and was much more active than any other antibiotics tested against e. cloacae and a. calcoaceticus. in the activity against e. faecalis, hr 810 was inferior to ampicillin but superior to czon. in mice with pyelonephritis caused by e. coli ec-7, the rank order of activities was hr 810 greater than caz greater than ctx greater than cpz. hr 810  was more effective than latamoxef, caz, ctx, and cpz in improving lung infections induced by streptococcus pneumoniae hl 438 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp-51 in mice. hr 810 was superior to ctx and cpz and comparable to cefazolin in therapeutic effects on intrauterine infections with e. coli ec-89 and s. aureus smith in rats.

TI  == epidemic of serratia marcescens bacteremia in a cardiac intensive care unit.
AB  == from 16 july through 27 september 1988, seven cases of nosocomial serratia marcescens bacteremia occurred in a cardiac care unit. in all seven case patients, s. marcescens was isolated from blood cultures. two of the seven had other microorganisms identified in the blood culture in which s. marcescens was recovered; one had enterobacter cloacae, and one had klebsiella pneumoniae. a case-control study was conducted to identify risk factors for bloodstream infection. case patients were more likely than controls to have been exposed to an intra-aortic balloon pump pressure transducer (7 of 7 versus 6 of 21; p = 0.001) and to a pulmonary arterial pressure transducer (7 of 7 versus 8 of 21; p  = 0.005). cultures of in-use and in-storage transducers revealed bacterial contamination of the pressure-sensitive membranes of the transducers. s. marcescens blood culture isolates obtained from five of the seven case patients,  as well as six s. marcescens isolates from cultured transducers, belonged to serotypes oundetermined:h1 and oundetermined:h18. e. cloacae isolates from one case patient and from two stored and two in-use transducers had identical antimicrobial suceptibility patterns. review of cardiac care unit disinfection practices revealed that the transducers were not processed with high-level disinfection or sterilization between patient uses. we concluded that the transducers had served as reservoirs for this outbreak of bloodstream infection.  because intra-aortic balloon pumps with pressure transducers are being used more  frequently in the management of critically ill cardiac patients, their role as infectious reservoirs should be considered in the investigation of nosocomial bacteremia.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

TI  == bactericidal activity of tigemonam, alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  == the in vitro bactericidal activity of tigemonam, alone and in combination with gentamicin, was evaluated against various strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris. minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were determined on three consecutive days with an inoculum of 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml or a culture in the logarithmic growth phase. the results found tigemonam to be rapidly bactericidal against most enterobacteriaceae isolated. in addition, the killing curves indicated a synergism between tigemonam and subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin.

TI  == antibacterial activity in vitro of tigemonam, a new oral monobactam.
AB  == using a broth microdilution method, the antibacterial activity of tigemonam, a novel oral monobactam, was evaluated against 217 gram-negative aerobes freshly isolated from clinical specimens. reference antibiotics were amoxicillin, amoxicillin-sulbactam, cephalexin, cefaclor, norfloxacin, and co-trimoxazole. at  a concentration of less than or equal to 8 mg/l, tigemonam inhibited 88% of the members of the enterobacteriaceae family. its activity was poor against the nonfermenter pathogens. in comparison with the other drugs, tigemonam generally exhibited superior antibacterial activity (with the exception of norfloxacin, which showed similar potency against the strains tested). minimum bactericidal concentrations and time-kill determinations indicated that tigemonam showed remarkable bactericidal activity, with a 9% reduction in colony-forming units after 2 h at a dose corresponding to fourfold its minimum inhibitory concentration. when tigemonam was used in combination with netilmicin and amikacin against susceptible representative isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli, a synergistic effect was obtained.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of enterobacteriaceae  (50 escherichia coli, 48 klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 enterobacter cloacae, 32 proteus mirabilis, 22 proteus indole-positive [providencia sp.], 24 serratia sp., and 12 citrobacter sp. all strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. in addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/ml. the highest intrinsic activity was observed against proteus sp. tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. it is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.

TI  == contaminated enteral nutrition solutions as a cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection: a study using plasmid fingerprinting.
AB  == in july 1984, two patients fed enteral nutrition solutions contaminated with enterobacter cloacae developed nosocomial bacteremia. despite careful review of the preparation procedures as well as repeated microbiological surveys, 83 (27%)  of the 309 formula bottles tested over a 1-yr period were contaminated and the source of contamination remained unknown. e. cloacae was the most frequent organism isolated (34%). the plasmid profiles of e. cloacae recovered from enteral nutrition solutions remained identical for several months. blood culture  isolates from 10 of the 40 patients who had developed e. cloacae nosocomial sepsis over a 7-yr period (1979-1985) had plasmid profiles linking them to contaminated enteral nutrition solutions. epidemiological data from a case control study revealed that these 10 patients were indeed more likely to be exposed to enteral nutrition than the 30 others: 9/10 vs 10/30 (odds ratio 18, p  = 0.002). similarly, two of seven nosocomial klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremias over a 6-month period in 1986 could be ascribed to administration of contaminated enteral liquid feeds prompting a general policy for using sterile commercially prepared solutions. our results suggest that contaminated enteral nutrition solutions represent a significant cause of nosocomial sepsis.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of the new semisynthetic cephalosporin cefpirome.
AB  == cefpirome (hr 810), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad antibacterial spectrum against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. against staphylococcus aureus, cefpirome was more active than not only  cefotaxime and ceftazidime but also cefotiam. against gram-negative bacteria, especially, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii, it was also more active than the other antibiotics tested, but against pseudomonas aeruginosa, it  was less active than ceftazidime. cefpirome was stable to hydrolysis by the common plasmid mediated beta-lactamases and was stable to the action of chromosomal cephalosporinases. but it was slightly hydrolyzed by both rms 213 mediated penicillinase and oxyiminocephalosporinases produced by proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas cepacia. when cefpirome was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
AB  == over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the third department of medicine, kanazawa university hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. this incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. the  rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the  first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. the majority of p. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of o-antigen  groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species, and staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide  with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins  and central venous catheters. it is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of p. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.

AB  == susceptibilities of gram-negative bacterial strains isolated at the university hospital in 1987 to six beta-lactam antibiotics (azthreonam cefmetazole, ceftizoxime, latamoxef, aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin) and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin and amikacin) were examined by agar dilution and the agar diffusion method. results obtained from both methods correlated well in most of the strains. most of the strains belonging to escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were sensitive to the beta-lactam antibiotics except aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin. they were also sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics. most strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were sensitive to azthreonam, latamoxef and aminoglycosides, but were less sensitive to other beta-lactams. acinetobacter calcoaceticus was generally resistant to beta-lactams except ceftizoxime, but was sensitive to aminoglycosides. more than half of the strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to azthreonam, piperacillin and aminoglycoside antibiotics and only latamoxef was active in pseudomonas maltophilia.

TI  == simple assay of beta-lactamase with agar medium containing a chromogenic cephalosporin, pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac).
AB  == a new beta-lactamase assay method with agar plates containing pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac) (50 microm), a beta-lactamase-labile, chromogenic cephalosporin, was examined. on the padac plates inoculated with beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (10(4) cfu per spot) and incubated at 37 degrees c, a yellow zone showing hydrolysis of padac by beta-lactamase was formed around the colony. the zone diameter increased with incubation time. examination with enterobacter cloacae gn7471 revealed that  beta-lactamase activity was present in the agar around the colony, decreasing exponentially with increasing distance from the colonial margin; this suggests that the padac hydrolysis zone is formed by an extracellular enzyme. at 18 h, significant correlations were obtained between the zone diameters of the 10 species (clinical isolates) examined and their periplasmic beta-lactamase activities determined spectrophotometrically. the addition of clavulanic acid (0.5 to 10 micrograms/ml) inhibited zone formation on the padac plates inoculated with type iiia, va, vb, pse-1, and ic beta-lactamase producers. when the clinical isolates were tested on plates with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml), inhibition was observed in 41 to 58% of the escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and in all isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and proteus vulgaris. thus, the use of the inhibitor made it  possible to detect penicillinase or type ic cephalosporinase producers. these results proved that the padac plate might be a useful tool permitting easy, semiquantitative determination of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == epidemiology of fecal strains of the family enterobacteriaceae in 22 neonatal wards and influence of antibiotic policy.
AB  == the gram-negative fecal floras from 953 infants were studied upon discharge of the infants from 22 neonatal wards. more than 600 distinct phenotypes of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. were distinguished by high-resolution biotyping. the colonization patterns observed showed considerable local and temporal variation. the major (m) strains (phenotypes), which colonized more than 10% and up to 78% of the infants in a ward (median, 23%), were klebsiella oxytoca (15 strains), e. coli (4 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1 strain), and enterobacter cloacae (1 strain). resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was more pronounced among m strains than among strains of enteric bacteria colonizing few or single infants only. local antibiotic policy influenced the colonization patterns. despite the fact that m strains of klebsiella spp. were usually resistant to ampicillin as well as to cephalexin and cefuroxime, their local dissemination was associated with the use of ampicillin with or without gentamicin but not with the use of cefuroxime. it thus appeared that in the neonatal setting, ampicillin posed a greater risk of local spread of  certain drug-resistant bacterial clones than a newer cephalosporin, such as cefuroxime.

AB  == the in vitro activity of r-3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a ch2och3 moiety at position 3, was compared with those of other antibiotics. r-3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups a, b, c, f, and g) and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0.06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2- to 8-fold more active than cefixime, and 16- to 64-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against branhamella spp. it did not inhibit (mic, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. the mics of r-3746 for 90% of strains tested for escherichia coli; klebsiella pneumoniae; citrobacter diversus; proteus mirabilis; and salmonella, shigella, and yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. it was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.  r-3746 inhibited 50% of enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, morganella spp., providencia spp., proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. pseudomonas spp. were resistant. fifty percent of clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but mics for bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. r-3746 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by most chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.

TI  == the differential expression of genes for the pse-4 beta-lactamase in pseudomonas  aeruginosa and the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the pse-4 beta-lactamase has been identified, for the first time, in two non-pseudomonal strains. the gene in klebsiella pneumoniae 241 (dal1) was located on a plasmid (puk700) and was freely transferable to other enterobacterial strains and pseudomonas aeruginosa. on the other hand, the gene in enterobacter cloacae a113 (dal2) could only be transferred in the presence of a mobilizing plasmid. when both these genes were transferred within the enterobacteriaceae, the beta-lactamase produced was slightly different from the prototype 'dalgleish' pse-4 enzyme. however, when dal1 and dal2 were transferred to p. aeruginosa the enzyme expressed was identical to this prototype enzyme. in addition, both these  genes expressed higher levels of pse-4 beta-lactamase production in p. aeruginosa than found in the enterobacteriaceae. thus it appears that the biochemical properties of the pse-4 gene products from dal1 and dal2 are host-modified.

AB  == bactericidal activity of cefotetan-gentamicin combinations was studied on 6 bacterial strains: s. aureus, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. vulgaris, p. stuarti. time kille curves technic was performed with final concentrations of cefotetan: 4 at 32 mg/l, and of gentamicin: 0.25; 0.5; 1; 2; 8  mg/l and with an 10(6) cfu/ml inoculum. cefotetan at 4 mg/l was not able to obtain a 0.01% (percentage of survivors) bactericidal activity before 24 h. the combination cefotetan-gentamicin (0.25 to 2 mg/l according to the strains) were bactericidal (0.01% of survivors) before 24 h: 1 to 6 h according to the strains, more rapidly than with gentamicin alone at the same concentration. this more rapid bactericidal activity obtained by cefotetan-gentamicin combination seems to indicate this combination in the treatment of severe infections in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  == enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. the mbcs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the mics, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. no single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. in systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against  one strain each of enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia rettgeri and ps. aeruginosa, and two staphylococcus aureus strains. single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.

TI  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

TI  == comparable evaluation of orally active beta-lactam compounds in ampicillin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative rods: role of beta-lactamases on resistance.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of the recently developed cephems cefixime and cefetamet-pivoxyl was evaluated in 408 gram-positive and gram-negative rods, all  isolated recently from clinical specimens, and compared to that of other orally active agents such as ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime-axetil and to ceftriaxone. with regard to ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae ceftriaxone proved to be the most active agent, followed by cefixime and cefetamet, whereas cefuroxime was less active. cefaclor and amoxycillin + claculanic acid were active against ampicillin-resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus ssp. isolates. all beta-lactam compounds exhibited poor activity against acinetobacter anitratus isolates, but were highly active against haemophilus influenzae with the exception of cefaclor. both cefixime and cefetamet were poorly active against staphylococcus aureus, but highly active against beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, both compounds remained unaffected by the production of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the tem or oxa enzymes. resistance to both agents was observed in enterobacteriaceae that produced large amounts of chromosomally mediated enzymes; their affinity to the class i enzyme from enterobacter cloacae was somewhat lower than that of other third-generation cephalosporins. however, in contrast with these agents breakdown of cefixime and  cefetamet by a class iiia enzyme form proteus vulgaris was marginal. in methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates there was a complete cross-resistance between all beta-lactam compounds included in this study.

AB  == nosocomial infections and gentamicin resistance were surveyed over 15 years at nashville veterans administration medical center, and trends for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were contrasted. analysis of approximately 6,000 nosocomial infections indicated that four-fifths were caused  by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. three hospital-wide outbreaks caused by enterobacteriaceae occurred; these three outbreaks were due to serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae, respectively. the outbreaks were temporally related to the emergence of gentamicin resistance. detailed analysis of the recent outbreak due to enterobacter indicated that an increasing prevalence of gentamicin-resistant e. cloacae predated nosocomial infections by several months; this pattern suggested that such outbreaks could be predicted. molecular epidemiologic data pertaining to the preservation over a decade of genes encoding gentamicin resistance were reviewed. in contrast to enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa gradually and progressively developed resistance to gentamicin that spread in an endemic fashion, with parallel increases in nosocomial infections. this pattern appeared to relate to different  modes of spread and persistence for resistant p. aeruginosa that may require unique methods for control.

TI  == [bacteriologic quality of water from the rhine and its tributaries in the rhine-neckar region. i. bacterial count and enterobacteriaceae of the current status of pollution].
AB  == during the period of may 1982 to january 1983 and march 1986 to may 1986, 164 water-specimens had been collected along the river rhine and its affluxes in the  overcrowded rhine-neckar-region from 34 collecting-sites on 8 different days. the specimens were tested for the total-germ-count and the titers of different enterobacteriaceae-species. the total-germ-count examined concentrations of several hundreds up to 1.8 million germ in 1 ml river-water. extremely high concentrations were found along the waste-water-influxes (purification-plants) and the overloaded rhine-affluences (leimbach, kraichbach, speyerbach, rehbach, neckar). the waste-water-samples from the central flow of the rhine-river showed  germ-concentrations of less than 10.000/ml, due to the mix-up of the waste water  with the rhine-water. enterobacteriaceae--549 isolates together--could be found mainly in specimens from all collected sites in low titers. e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia liquefaciens and citrobacter freundii  had been the highest recovery rate. the isolation of salmonellae was examined because of specific methods in a separate study (2. communication). based on these data, it has to be concluded, that the water of the rhine-river and its affluxes in the rhine-neckar-region is an uncontrolled germ-reservoir. the use of this water for bathing, unprocessed drinking-water or for agriculture purpose has to be refused from the hygienic point of view.

TI  == [hemagglutinating and adhesive capacities of klebsiella and enterobacter strains].
AB  == the authors analyze the data of studies on the hemagglutinating and adhesive capacity of 290 cultures, including 118 k. pneumoniae strains and 64 e. cloacae strains isolated from sick children, as well as 59 k. pneumoniae strains and 49 e. cloacae strains isolated from healthy children. the hemagglutinating properties of the strains were determined in the hemagglutination test with fresh, formalin- and tannin-treated red blood cells, the adhesive properties were studied by light microscopy. among k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae strains isolated  in acute intestinal infections, mannose-sensitive hemagglutination and pronounced adhesive activity were prevalent in most cases. poorly adhesive and nonadhesive strains were characteristic of k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae cultures isolated from healthy children. the strains isolated from sick and healthy children differed only by the prevalence of adhesive cultures.

TI  == non-ige-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  == a wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that e. coli-induced histamine release differed from ige-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and ph profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. a lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. escherichia coli and anti-ige did not synergize in inducing histamine release. the production of pgd2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with e. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a comparative study on the phoe genes of three enterobacterial species. implications for structure-function relationships in a pore-forming protein of the outer membrane.
AB  == the cloned phoe genes from enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae are normally expressed and regulated in escherichia coli k-12, and their products are correctly assembled into the outer membrane. differences between the three phoe proteins were found with binding of two out of ten monoclonal antibodies directed against the cell-surface-exposed part and in pore characteristics, but not in phage receptor function. the dna sequences of the e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae phoe genes were determined and used to predict the primary structures of the encoded proteins. in the upstream non-coding regions, which showed more variations among the three genes than the coding regions, conserved sequences were identified which might be involved in regulation of phoe gene expression. comparison of the predicted phoe primary structures revealed a high degree of homology, with 81% of the amino acid residues being identical in all three proteins. four small variable regions were found where differences are the most pronounced, corresponding to regions which were previously predicted to be exposed at the cell surface. implications of the sequence comparison for structure-function relationships in phoe protein are discussed.

TI  == [clinical study on effects of cefmetazole on severe infections accompanied by hematologic diseases].
AB  == severe infections accompanied by hematopathy under granulocytopenic conditions were treated with cefmetazole (cmz). subject diseases mainly consisted of acute leukemia, agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia; combined infections were septicemia, pneumonia, fever of an undetermined origin, etc. as for causative organisms found in cases that could be examined, gram-negative bacilli such as klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae were isolated, as was staphylococcus aureus. in general, 4 g of cmz divided into 2 administrations was given per day through intravenous injection or intravenous drip infusion. on the basis of the judgement criteria for effectiveness established by takaku et al., the efficacy rate in this study was found to be 68%, including 2 cases that showed excellent responses to treatment of infections caused by s. aureus. cases that showed pyretolysis within 4 days had over 1,000/microliter of neutrophils, while cases with less than 1,000/microliter showed no pyretolysis. no hepatorenal dysfunctions related to the treatment with cmz were seen as side effects except increases of transaminase in 1 case. these results indicate that cmz is a useful drug for the treatment of  infections accompanied by hematopathy under granulocytopenic condition.

TI  == phenotypic characteristics of coliform and noncoliform bacteria from a public water supply compared with regional and national clinical species.
AB  == during the summer and fall of 1984, elevated total coliform counts were observed  in the distribution system of a public water supply serving 350,000 people in south central connecticut. as part of an investigation of possible health risks associated with the presence of bacteria in the water supply, bacterial isolates  from the distribution system were compared with bacterial isolates of the same species obtained from a large regional teaching hospital and from a national compendium of clinical isolates. characteristics analyzed included phenotypic metabolic activity, antimicrobial susceptibilities to clinically utilized antibiotics, temperature tolerance at 44.5 degrees c, and beta-glucuronidase activity in single-test form and on a selective medium. environmental isolates lacked known plasmid-mediated characteristics, with the exception of one escherichia coli isolate which showed some antibiotic resistance. klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter agglomerans from all sources were temperature tolerant and yielded positive fecal coliform tests. only e. coli showed beta-glucuronidase activity (both in a single biochemical test and on a selective medium). no single characteristic analyzed was sufficient to establish an organism as either environmental or clinical in origin.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074).
AB  == ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and  streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. they did not inhibit s. faecalis, s. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jk species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates,  were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. both agents inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, shigella species, citrobacter diversus, and aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. a marked inoculum effect was noted for enterobacteriaceae carrying the richmond-sykes type 1a chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. cloacae, p99.

AB  == 234 strains, including 104 k. pneumoniae strains, 28 k. oxytoxica strains, 64 e.  cloacae strains and 40 e. aerogenes strains, have been isolated from the intestine of 266 children with diarrhea, aged up to 1 year, and studied for enterotoxigenicity. by the coagglutination test, made with g. kronvall's staphylococcal reagent prepared with the use of antiserum to escherichia coli lt-enterotoxin, and the biological assay on suckling mice enterotoxigenic activity has been revealed in 119 strains, including 48 k. pneumoniae strains (12.6%), 33 e. cloacae strains (27.4%) and 23 e. aerogenes strains (19.7%). the strains producing only lt-enterotoxins, only st-enterotoxins, and both lt- and st-enterotoxins have been found. the determination of the enterotoxigenic activity of the clinical isolates of opportunistic enterobacteria makes it possible to improve the etiological interpretation of acute intestinal infections.

TI  == combination therapy: a way to limit emergence of resistance?
AB  == the ability of antibiotic combinations to limit the emergence of resistance during therapy was evaluated in a murine model. peritonitis was produced by injecting a mixture containing 10(8) colony-forming units of bacteria and sterilized talcum into the peritoneum. two hours later, a single antibiotic dose  was administered subcutaneously. the next day, peritoneal bacterial populations were analyzed on szybalski's gradients. acquired resistance was recorded when there was at least a fourfold increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations compared with untreated animals. no resistance emerged after amikacin monotherapy (15 mg/kg); however, resistance was frequently observed after monotherapy with ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) or pefloxacin (25 mg/kg). resistance to ceftriaxone and pefloxacin emerged, respectively, in 15 percent and 83 percent of animals with klebsiella pneumoniae, 71 percent and 54 percent with enterobacter cloacae, 0 percent and 83 percent with serratia marcescens, 25 percent and 100 percent with  pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 0 percent with both escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. in mice with k. pneumoniae or e. cloacae infections, any dual combination of amikacin, pefloxacin, and ceftriaxone produced less acquired  resistance than did monotherapy. in these animals, the combination of ceftriaxone and pefloxacin abolished all resistance, whereas the combinations of amikacin plus ceftriaxone or amikacin plus pefloxacin reduced the frequency of resistance  by more than half. in animals with p. aeruginosa or s. marcescens infections, resistance to pefloxacin diminished or disappeared after treatment with the combinations of pefloxacin plus ceftriaxone or pefloxacin plus amikacin. however, combinations with ceftriaxone resulted in more frequent resistance to ceftriaxone than did ceftriaxone alone. this was the case in p. aeruginosa infections treated with ceftriaxone plus amikacin (p less than 0.01), and in s. marcescens infections treated with ceftriaxone plus pefloxacin (p less than 0.05). despite these certain notable exceptions, our data confirm that in most cases combination therapy does limit the emergence of resistance.

TI  == in vitro activity of ci-934, a new quinolone, compared with that of other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone, was determined against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the mics for 90% of the isolates tested were 0.25 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.5 microgram/ml for streptococcus faecalis, 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, and less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella spp., klebsiella spp., proteus spp., and citrobacter spp. ci-934 had activity superior to that of other quinolones against streptococci by four- to eightfold. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was 2- to 18-fold more active; ofloxacin and norfloxacin were twofold more active or similar to ci-934. ci-934 inhibited ampicillin-cephalothin-resistant urinary isolates of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis and cefoxatime-resistant acinetobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii. the medium, inoculum size, and oxygen concentration, as well as the addition of serum, had not major effect on the activity of ci-934. magnesium at a concentration of 9 mm increased mics and mbcs four- to eightfold, and testing at  ph 6 increased mics as much as 32- to 64-fold for some organisms in comparison with mics at ph 7. the frequency of spontaneous mutation to resistance was comparable to that for other new quinolones, but resistant isolates could be selected by repeated subculture.

TI  == transfer of amikacin resistance by closely related plasmids in members of the family enterobacteriaceae isolated in chile.
AB  == during a 9-month period when amikacin was the sole aminoglycoside used clinically in a hospital in santiago, chile, resistance to amikacin and other antibiotics was encountered in 42 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and serratia liquefaciens. amikacin resistance was  transferable by conjugation and carried by incm plasmids ranging in size from ca. 48.4 to 58.1 kilobase pairs. the plasmids had ca. 70 to 80% of their structure in common, as judged after digestion with restriction endonucleases. the resistance  was mediated by a 6' aminoglycoside acetyltransferase. we conclude that selective pressure has favored the dissemination of a wide-host-range amikacin resistance plasmid and its derivatives.

TI  == the colonization of patients in an intensive treatment unit with gram-negative flora: the significance of the oral route.
AB  == an extensive survey of patients and the environment in a newly refurbished intensive care unit showed that the principle species on patients in sites other  than the rectum were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter anitratus and enterobacter cloacae. multiple episodes of cross-infection were occurring with 10 different strains of these organisms. three oral solutions (mouthwashes, 'clinifeeds' and residual water from nasogastric aspiration apparatus) were heavily contaminated with coliforms including some epidemic strains and this corresponded with the finding that colonization with the above species usually occurred first in the mouth or respiratory tract. attempts to eliminate contamination of the solutions reduced colonization and cross-infection by over 50%, but did not eradicate it. two sinks without heat-traps on the drains possibly provided a long term reservoir of epidemic strains.

TI  == in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  == pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. a comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (escherichia coli, indole + proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (klebsiella pneumoniae). pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 100 staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). it was markedly less active against streptococcus faecalis and str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the mic90 being 4 mg/l against both species. overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against p. aeruginosa, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. against e. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. a paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. an optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in  blood of patients treated with this drug.

TI  == molecular evolution, species distribution, and clinical consequences of an endemic aminoglycoside resistance plasmid.
AB  == during the first 6 years after appearing in one hospital, a 92-kilobase conjugative plasmid, pbwh1, which encoded resistance to chloramphenicol and sulfonamides and determined tem-1 beta-lactamase and 2''-aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase, underwent a variety of molecular changes. it was most prevalent initially in isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, then in isolates of serratia marcescens, and finally, after nearly disappearing, in isolates of enterobacter cloacae. evolutionary changes in the plasmid did not account for its shifts in species distribution, since the original molecule was found in isolates of each species. the late resurgence of pbwh1 occurred after a copy of its original molecule entered a distinctive ornithine decarboxylase-negative strain of e. cloacae, new to the hospital. the resulting transconjugant strain, chromosomally resistant to topical silver salts and to cephalosporins, and with the addition of pbwh1-encoded aminoglycoside resistance, spread in the hospital by causing an outbreak of sepsis in the burn unit, where these were commonly used antibacterial agents. thus, an endemic plasmid became prevalent in a new host species because one of its genes supplemented the fitness of an uncommon strain of the species for a particular clinical niche.

TI  == in-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro synergism between piperacillin and netilmicin against microorganisms isolated from danish patients  with septicemia and to examine the influence of inactivation of piperacillin among these bacteria on the synergy results. a total of 132 stains was examined:  escherichia coli 20, indole-positive proteus 17, klebsiella pneumoniae 18, enterobacter cloacae 20, pseudomonas aeruginosa 20, staphylococcus aureus 20, and coagulase-negative staphylococci 17. synergy testing was performed by checkerboard titration in microtiter trays. the ability of the strains to inactivate piperacillin was examined by the clover-leaf test. synergism was found for 52% of the strains and partial synergism for 32%. antagonism was not found. of the piperacillin-resistant strains synergism could be demonstrated in 80% compared with 33% of the piperacillin-susceptible strains (p less than 0.001). no significant correlation was seen between the results of the synergy test and the  results of the susceptibility test to netilmicin. the frequency of piperacillin inactivation according to the clover-leaf test was significantly higher among the strains with synergism than among all the others (p less than 0.02). the combination of piperacillin and netilmicin gave good results concerning the in vitro synergism. this synergism was probably sometimes caused by netilmicin disturbing the bacterial production of piperacillin-inactivating proteins.

TI  == lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

TI  == gentamicin vs cefotaxime for therapy of neonatal sepsis. relationship to drug resistance.
AB  == an outbreak of serious infections due to gentamicin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae occurred in a neonatal intensive care unit in which the combination of gentamicin sulfate and ampicillin sodium had been used for standard initial therapy for suspected sepsis for nearly 11 years. after institution of control measures that included the substitution of cefotaxime sodium for gentamicin in the standard regimen, the outbreak promptly subsided. nevertheless, a second outbreak of serious infections due to cefotaxime-resistant enterobacter cloacae began ten weeks later. sequential stool cultures from patients in the unit confirmed the disappearance of gentamicin-resistant k pneumoniae and the emergence of cefotaxime-resistant e cloacae after the change in antibiotic policy. these observations suggest that routine use of newer cephalosporins for therapy of suspected sepsis may lead to the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms more rapidly than has occurred with the aminoglycosides.

TI  == [carbenicillin resistance of gram-negative bacteria: incidence, biochemical and genetic determinism].
AB  == of nine hundred ampicillin resistant (amp-r) enterobacteria strains, isolated in  hospital between july and december 1981, 73,7% are also carbenicillin-resistant (carb-r). this particular double resistance varies depending upon the species considered: indole positive proteus (23%), enterobacter cloacae (64%), citrobacter freundii (67%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (73%), proteus mirabilis  (75%), serratia marcescens (90%), escherichia coli (91%), providencia stuartii (96%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (100%). the biochemical and genetic basis of resistance to beta-lactamines was studied in 27 strains belonging to these 9 species. a constitutive beta-lactamase was found in all the strains. these enzymes were identified by determination of the isoelectric point on crude sonic  extracts, the enzymic activity profile, the inhibition by clavulanic acid and cloxacillin of enzyme activity. two types of enzymes were predominant: tem-1 (20  strains) and tem-2 (7 strains); two strains of klebsiella pneumoniae produced both shv-1 and tem-1. the transfer by conjugation to e. coli k12 of ampicillin and carbenicillin resistance was obtained with 14 strains: (e. coli: 9, c. freundii: 1, k. pneumoniae: 1, e. cloacae: 2, p. stuartii: 1). in all strains but one e. coli we noted the co-transfer of other antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. in a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. the data were unsuitable for  determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. all strains of streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of actinobacillus  suis were highly susceptible to the drug (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (mic 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be  highly resistant to cefadroxil (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml).

AB  == population analyses of susceptibility to cefotaxime (ctx) and desacetyl-cefotaxime (dctx) of strains of staphylococcus and some genera of enterobacteriaceae were carried out. dctx, which is the main metabolite of ctx, has antimicrobial activity. the penicillinase-producing strains of s. aureus and  s. epidermidis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to both agents. ctx was about 4-8 times more active than dctx. the methicillin-resistant strains contained a sub-population of resistant bacteria with both ctx and dctx. the frequency of resistant bacteria was 10(-6) - 10(-5). the e. coli strain was homogeneous to both agents. the strains of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii had a sub-population of resistant bacteria with both agents. the frequency of resistant bacteria was 10(-7) - 10(-4.5). in klebsiella pneumoniae no resistant sub-population was found. ctx was about four times more active than  dctx with the strains of the enterobacteriaceae. dctx had no advantage over ctx as regards homogeneity of susceptibility of the populations examined. ctx seems applicable for treatment of infections with e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and penicillinase-producing, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus, but should not be used alone in treatments of infections with enterobacter cloacae or citrobacter freundii.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == transfer of cefamandole resistance was demonstrated from strains of citrobacter freundii as well as from individual strains of enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter anitratus and klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from patients in two newborn units. in citrobacter freundii, cefamandole resistance was transferred always with cephalotin resistance as well as with a tem-like beta lactamase (conferring resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin and azlocillin). citrobacter  freundii strains from hospital i were completely susceptible to gentamicin, while strains of other species, resistant to cefamandole plus cephalotin, were resistant to gentamicin as well, and transferred this resistance, too. in one enterobacter cloacae strain from hospital i, cefamandole resistance could be separated from resistance to cephalotin, but only in clones selected with gentamicin and not with any of the cephalosporins. acinetobacter anitratus strain was also resistant to cefotaxime, but did not transfer this resistance. it might  be concluded that special nosocomial bacteria may carry plasmids conferring a transferable type of resistance to cefamandole together with resistance to classical cephalosporines. second cycle of transfers, i.e. between two variants of e. coli k-12 strains confirmed the contransferability of cefamandole and cephalotin resistance.

AB  == the ability of three quinolones, two beta-lactams, and one aminoglycoside to select resistant mutants was examined in tests with 30 isolates of commonly encountered nosocomial pathogens. ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, two new quinolone derivatives, were no more likely to select resistant mutants than amikacin, whereas nalidixic acid, an older quinolone derivative, was the most likely of the six drugs examined to select resistant mutants. mutational frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-8) were observed in most instances. in general, the  mutants were 8 to 16 times less susceptible to the drug used for selection. although most quinolone-selected mutants were cross-resistant only to other drugs within this class, certain mutants of klebsiella pneumoniae selected by nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, or norfloxacin were also less susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. this unusual pattern of multiple drug resistance was associated with changes in outer membrane proteins of the organism. multiple drug resistance was  also observed in beta-lactam-selected mutants of enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa (beta-lactams), amikacin-selected mutants of providencia stuartii and p. aeruginosa (aminoglycosides), and beta-lactam- or amikacin-selected mutants of serratia marcescens (beta-lactams plus aminoglycosides). these results underscore the need to examine carefully the frequency with which resistance to any new antibiotic develops, as well as the patterns of multiple drug resistance which may occur simultaneously.

TI  == in vitro activity of win 49375 compared with those of other antibiotics in isolates from cancer patients.
AB  == the activity of win 49375 [6-fluoro-1, 4-dihydro-1-(methylamino)-7-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxo-3- quinolinecarboxylic acid], a new synthetic quinolone, was tested in vitro against 587 clinical isolates. the mics for 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae were 0.20, 1.56, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. the mics for 90% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens were both 3.12 micrograms/ml. win 49375 was minimally active against gram-positive cocci. its in vitro activity suggests that it may be useful for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections.

TI  == effect of ph, application technique, and chlorine-to-nitrogen ratio on disinfectant activity of inorganic chloramines with pure culture bacteria.
AB  == the influence of ph, application technique, and chlorine-to-nitrogen weight ratio on the bactericidal activity of inorganic chloramine compounds was determined with stock and environmental strains of escherichia coli, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae. the rate of inactivation increased from 1.5 to 2 times as the chlorine-to-nitrogen weight  ratio was adjusted from 2:1 to 5:1, 5 to 6 times as the ph was decreased from 8 to 6, and 5 to 6 times as the concentration was increased from 1 to 5 mg/liter. separate additions of free chlorine and ammonia (concurrent addition and preammoniation) into seeded water at or below ph 7.5 resulted in killing comparable to that observed with free chlorine (99% inactivation in less than 20  s). at ph 8, inactivation by separate additions was considerably slower and was comparable to that by prereacted chloramine compounds (99% inactivation in 25 to  26 min). determination of the effectiveness of inorganic chloramine compounds as  primary disinfectants for drinking water must consider the method of application, ph and concentrations of chlorine and ammonia.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fr 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fr 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. it was less active (mic, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit  streptococcus faecalis or listeria monocytogenes. fr 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. fr 17027 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, providencia stuartii, providencia rettgeri, and citrobacter diversus at  less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. some strains of enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (mic, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). fr 17027 did not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa, other pseudomonas species, acinetobacter species, or bacteroides species. activity was  minimally affected by growth conditions. fr 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.

TI  == use of the becton-dickinson urine culture tube with the abbott ms-2 urine screening system.
AB  == urine specimens were obtained from 312 obstetric outpatients by sterile midstream technique and aliquots placed in both becton-dickinson urine culture tubes and sterile conventional tubes. quantitative cultures were made from each tube, and each tube was screened for bacteria with the abbott ms-2 urine screening system.  the time required to detect bacteriuria was recorded for both specimens. isolates from specimens containing greater than or equal to 50,000/ml gram-positive cocci  or greater than or equal to 100,000/ml gram-negative bacilli were identified and  antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. delayed (24 hr) quantitative cultures were done from becton-dickinson tubes. by these criteria, 124 urine specimens were positive in both conventional and becton-dickinson tubes. escherichia coli (n = 72), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), proteus mirabilis (n = 4), group b streptococcus (n = 12), and enterococcus (n = 8) were isolated. time for detection of positive urine samples  was similar in both types of tubes. delayed cultures had significant numbers of false-positive results. antimicrobial susceptibility results did not appear to be influenced greatly by becton-dickinson tube transport. the ms-2 cannot adequately discriminate cultures containing less than 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of urine. the becton-dickinson tube appears to be compatible for use with the ms-2 for purposes of screening for bacteriuria.

TI  == carbohydrate-binding sites of the mannose-specific fimbrial lectins of enterobacteria.
AB  == the combining sites of type 1 fimbrial lectins of various species of enterobacteria were studied by measuring the inhibitory activity of linear and branched oligosaccharides and several glycosides of d-mannose on the agglutination of yeast cells by the organisms. the results showed that all five strains of escherichia coli tested possessed an elongated combining site best fitting a trisaccharide and including a hydrophobic region. similar results were  obtained with klebsiella pneumoniae. within the salmonella genus, the combining sites of the six species tested were similar, but all differed significantly from those of the e. coli strains. the combining sites of enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter agglomerans were different from each other and from those of salmonella sp. and e. coli. the results suggest that although classified under the general term "mannose-specific," bacterial lectins in the form of type 1 fimbriae on different genera exhibit differences in sugar specificities.

TI  == chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == chemiluminescence (cl) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal cl response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. we investigated the luminol-enhanced cl response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. we analyzed  the cl response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees c.  the cl response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees c. variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced cl. each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. in the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in cl: enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and zymosan. in the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pyogenes. the cl response also reflected serum opsonic activity. the effect of inactivated complement, factor b, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak cl; however, a strain of e. coli caused a variation in  peak time rather than peak height. different cl kinetics were shown for three strains of k. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or  cell wall characteristics. this study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal cl response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == detection of pse-2 beta-lactamase in enterobacteria.
AB  == pse-2, a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase which was previously considered pseudomonas specific, was observed in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, and enterobacter cloacae. all four isolates transferred pse-2 production, together with resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and sulfamethoxazole, into escherichia coli j62-1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21. transfer correlated with acquisition by the transconjugants of a 65-megadalton plasmid, and this element was considered to encode pse-2 expression. the pse-2 enzyme conferred high-level carbenicillin resistance on both j62-1 and pu21 transconjugants, although the pse-2-producing providencia stuartii isolate was susceptible to carbenicillin.

TI  == bacterial growth and endotoxin production in lipid emulsion.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae serotypes 21 and 24 and enterobacter cloacae were responsible for an outbreak of polymicrobial bacteremia associated with the receipt of lipid emulsion. since it is recommended that lipid emulsion be kept refrigerated between uses, we undertook a study to determine the growth characteristics of these organisms in lipid emulsion at 5 and 25 degrees c and to examine the use of alternative measurements (ph and endotoxin) to determine contamination by viable and nonviable microorganisms. the bacteria survived but did not proliferate at 5 degrees c; no endotoxin was detected, and the ph remained unchanged. in contrast, after a 2-h lag phase, all three organisms proliferated rapidly when incubated at 25 degrees c and reached concentrations of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu/ml at 24 h. a decrease in ph was detected after proliferation to 10(7) cfu/ml. endotoxin was detected after proliferation reached 10(2) cfu/ml. the amount of endotoxin elaborated by the three organisms differed and ranged from 0.013 ng per 8 x 10(2) cfu/ml to 1.3 ng per 2 x 10(3) cfu/ml at 8 h. our findings show that these microorganisms do not proliferate at  refrigerator temperature in lipid emulsion, but can reach significant levels at room temperature. it is, therefore, important to keep lipid emulsion refrigerated between uses. furthermore, when lipid emulsion contamination is suspected, endotoxin and ph determinations should be considered as possible adjunctive tests while results of bacterial cultures are pending. the results of the present study are applicable to only selected gram-negative bacteria and may not apply to gram-positive bacteria and fungi. however, these data demonstrate that measurement of ph and detection of endotoxin is quite useful when lipid emulsion  contamination occurs with selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == effect of nifa product on suppression of nif- phenotype of gln mutation and constitutive synthesis of nitrogenase in klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == this paper describes the role of nifa product on the ammonia regulation of nitrogen fixation in k. pneumoniae. a plasmid carrying nifa gene under the promoter of tetracycline resistance gene was constructed. when this nifa carrying plasmid was introduced into a glnag mutant, the nif- phenotype of this gln mutant was suppressed. furthermore, when the plasmid was introduced into the wild type and glnag mutant, derepression of nitrogenase synthesis in ammonia occurred in both strains and the products of nif genes can be detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in the extracts of these ammonia-grown bacterial cells. the constitutive synthesis of nitrogenase in nh4+ was also demonstrated in free living nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enterobacter cloacae, when the bacteria received the plasmid carrying nifa gene from k. pneumoniae.

TI  == synthesis of plasmid-coded heat-labile enterotoxin in wild-type and hypertoxinogenic strains of escherichia coli and in other genera of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the effect of host determinants on expression of plasmid-coded heat-labile enterotoxin (lt) was examined. a collection of lt plasmids was introduced into isogenic strains of escherichia coli k-12 strains containing the wild type or hypertoxinogenic (htx-2) allele. for each plasmid tested, production of lt increased by approximately 1.5- to 3-fold in the host containing htx-2, indicating that the htx-2 allele affects a regulatory function for lt production  that is common to many different enterotoxin plasmids. lt plasmids from e. coli were also introduced into strains of shigella flexneri, shigella sonnei, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhimurium. the plasmids were stably maintained and determined production of lt  in those genera, although the amounts of lt produced varied by more than 50-fold. these observations demonstrate that host factors have an important role in determining the level of expression of plasmid-coded lt genes and support the hypothesis that interspecific, conjugal transfer of enterotoxin plasmids may confer enterotoxigenicity to a wide variety of potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria.

AB  == the bactec resin-containing blood culture bottle (16b; johnston laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. however, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. this in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16b to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16b and the 6b (conventional aerobic) bottles. the studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16b bottles. low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly.  the indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. the failure of the bactec 16b blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.

AB  == during the period from may through july 1981, a comparative study was carried out on the antibacterial activities of cefotaxime (ctx) and ceftizoxime (czx), cefoperazone (cpz), latamoxef (lmox), cefotiam (ctm), cefmetazole (cmz) and cefazolin (cez). ctx and these other cephem antibiotics were tested against fresh clinical isolates which had been obtained from clinical materials by the laboratories of 14 participating medical institutions. 1. the clinical isolates were obtained from various clinical materials in the following decreasing order:  urine, sputum and pus/discharge; 85.7% of the isolates came from these materials. 2. concerning the sources of each species of clinical isolates, it was found that p. aeruginosa was isolated from the greatest number -9- of different clinical materials. this was followed by e. coli and e. cloacae, each isolated from 8 different clinical materials, and c. freundii and e. aerogenes, each found in 7 different clinical materials. 3. in relation to s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, ctx showed the best antibacterial activity; the second most potent antibiotic was czx. cmz and lmox were found to show relatively high mic values for those species. against s. aureus, cez showed the best antibacterial activity, but 3 resistant strains had mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 4. with regard to gram-negative bacteria, ctx and czx showed the best antibacterial activities for all of the species, except for p. aeruginosa. these were followed, in order, by lmox and cpz. compared with these 4 antibiotics, ctm, cmz and cez were found to have inferior antibacterial activities against these bacteria. in relation to p. aeruginosa, the peak of the mic distribution for cpz was 6.25 micrograms/ml, and this was the best antibacterial activity detected with the various antibiotics tested. this was followed by ctx (25 micrograms/ml) lmox (25  micrograms/ml) and czx (50 micrograms/ml). ctm had an mic of 100 micrograms/ml for 1 strain, and mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml for all of the other strains of p. aeruginosa, indicating them to be resistant to this antibiotic. all of the strains were resistant to cmz and cez, showing mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 5. for each of the tested antibiotics, no correlation was found between the mic and the serogroup for either p. aeruginosa or s. marcescens.

TI  == facultative gram-negative enteric rods in persistent periapical infections.
AB  == a bacteriological investigation has been made in two cases of persistent periapical infections. neither of the two infections responded to root canal therapy including penicillin or penicillin and erythromycin. samples were taken aseptically for bacteriological examination through and root canals. chloroform-washed, sterile paper points were used for sampling. cultivation was performed immediately at chairside on kanamycin-vancomycin laked blood agar (kvlb) and blood agar supplemented with menadione, cysteine and glucose for anaerobic incubation and chocolate agar for aerobic incubation. enterobacter cloacae was only isolate in case 1; klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococci were found in case 2. obligately anaerobic bacteria were not found. the treatment was  successful after antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility testing of the isolates. the route of infection by facultative enteric rods is discussed.

AB  == the analysis of the chromatograms of methyl esters of fatty acids in bacterial strains of the tribe klebsielleae showed the heterogeneity of the fatty acid composition of bacteria belonging to the genera klebsiella, enterobacter, hafnia  and serratia. the bacteria of this tribe could be subdivided into 5 provisory groups in accordance with the composition and profile of their fatty acids. group i comprised k. pneumoniae k1, k. ozaenae and k. rhinoscleromatis strains forming  a separate group characterized by the absence of cyclopropane fatty acids; group  ii comprised k. pneumoniae strains of other capsular serovars (k2, k8, k11, k13,  k41, k47), as well as k. aerogenes and k. oxytoca strains. the fatty acid composition of the strains of group iii, comprising e. aerogenes and e. cloacae,  was similar to that of e. coli o1; only among the fatty acids of these bacteria acid c20:0 could be detected. h. alvei strains were included into group iv; their fatty acid profiles were similar to those of the genus enterobacter, but had a higher content of acids c15:0 and c18:0. s. marcescens strains were similar to the strains of group ii in their fatty acid composition, but considerably differed from the latter by a higher content of hexadecanoate (c16:0) and a lower level of c18:1; for this reason they were regarded as provisory group v.

TI  == 6-acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. ii. antibacterial properties.
AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefmenoxime.
AB  == the activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. it was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. it had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae.  it did not inhibit streptococcus faecalis or listeria spp. cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam  against escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, salmonella, and shigella. it inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter  aerogenes, and enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration  for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), proteus vulgaris and providencia spp. it was as active as ceftizoxime was against serratia. pseudomonas spp. and bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for  90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). the compound was stable to the  common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of tem. it was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by bacteroides and acinetobacter.

TI  == mode of action of azthreonam.
AB  == azthreonam (sq 26,776) is a member of a new class of monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. in escherichia coli, azthreonam caused filamentation at its lowest effective concentration (0.2 microgram/ml), a morphological effect identical to that observed with cephalothin. the penicillin-binding protein (pbp) profile indicated a very high affinity for pbp3 (complete binding at 0.1 microgram/ml), a moderate affinity for pbp1a (complete binding at 10 micrograms/ml), and poor affinities for pbp1b, pbp2, pbp4, and pbp5/6 (complete binding at greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml). accordingly, azthreonam had poor activity against streptomyces r61 dd-carboxypeptidase (50% inhibition, greater than 100 micrograms/ml) and e. coli peptidoglycan transpeptidase (50% inhibition, 100 micrograms/ml). azthreonam also showed very high affinity for pbp3 (complete binding at 0.1 microgram/ml) in proteus vulgaris, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in all four organisms, its pbp profile was similar to that observed in e. coli. it is concluded that azthreonam, although of novel structure, has a mode of action similar to that of cephalosporins, affecting specifically septation in e. coli and most likely other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == the inhibition of beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria by clavulanic acid.
AB  == the beta-lactamase from klebsiella pneumoniae e70 behaved in a similar fashion to the tem-2 plasmid mediated enzyme on reaction with clavulanic acid. both enzymes  produced two types of enzyme-clavulanate complex, a transiently stable species (t((1/2))=4min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c) and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. in the initial rapid reaction (2.5min) the enzymes partitioned between the transient and irreversible complexes in the ratios 3:1 for tem-2 beta-lactamase and 1:1 for klebsiella beta-lactamase. biphasic inactivation was observed for both enzymes and the slower second phase was rate limited by the decay of the transiently stable complex. this decay released free enzyme for further reaction with fresh clavulanic acid, the products again partitioning between transiently stable and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. this cycle continued until all the enzyme had been irreversibly inhibited. a 115 molar excess of inhibitor was required to achieve complete inactivation of tem-2 beta-lactamase. hydrolysis of clavulanic acid with product release appeared to occur with the inhibition reaction, which explained this degree of clavulanic acid turnover. the stoichiometry of the interaction with klebsiella beta-lactamase was not examined. the penicillinase from proteus mirabilis c889 was rapidly inhibited by low concentrations of clavulanic acid. the major product was a moderately stable complex (t((1/2))=40min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c); the proportion of the enzyme that was irreversibly inactivated was small. the cephalosporinase from enterobacter cloacae p99 had low affinity for the inhibitor and only reacted with high concentrations of clavulanic acid (k=4.0m(-1).s(-1)) to produce a relatively stable complex (t((1/2))=180min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c). no irreversible inactivation of this enzyme was detected. the rates of decay of the clavulanate-enzyme complexes produced in reactions with proteus and enterobacter enzymes were markedly increased at acid ph.

TI  == successful treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis with moxalactam.
AB  == meningitis caused by enteric gram-negative bacilli is relatively uncommon but is  very difficult to treat despite susceptibility in vitro to many antimicrobics. a  major problem appears to be poor entry of many drugs into the central nervous system. moxalactam is an investigational cephalosporin that attains concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid that are 15% to 30% of contemporaneous  serum concentrations; moreover, it is quite active against many of the enteric gram-negative bacilli. we used moxalactam to treat meningitis caused by enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli in four adults  and one child, giving up to 100 mg/kg body weight per day by intravenous injection. the concentrations of moxalactam in serum, lumbar, and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid exceeded the minimal lethal concentrations of all causative bacteria. the patients were cured. in this small series, moxalactam, when administered intravenously as the sole agent of therapy, was effective in the treatment of meningitis caused by susceptible gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == against most test strains of gram-negative bacilli, the in vitro effect of fr-31564 together with beta-lactam antibiotics or trimethoprim was strongly synergistic; with tetracycline and nalidixic acid the effect was additive; and with gentamicin and sulfamethoxazole the effect was additive or antagonistic. fr-31564 was markedly synergistic with beta-lactam antibiotics against beta-lactam antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli such as klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. the combination of fr-31564 with beta-lactam antibiotics effected a reduction of mics against most of the test strains to clinically achievable concentrations in human serum.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of fr-31564, a phosphonic acid antimicrobial agent.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of fr-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(n-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. the in  vitro activity of fr-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. in vitro activity of fr-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. the type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with mueller-hinton, heart infusion, or trypticase soy agars. fr-31564  was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and citrobacter. it was less active than fosfomycin against serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. fr-31564 inhibited a number of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and some pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. in the presence and absence of human blood fr-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and p. aeruginosa exposed to fr-31564 for  3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. fr-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with p. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. it was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with e. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.

TI  == pathological study of infective endocarditis on hancock porcine bioprostheses.
AB  == a pathological study has been performed on 10 infected hancock bioprostheses removed from nine patients who died of prosthetic endocarditis. the devices had been in place from 2 to 87 months (average 37.5), the interval between operation  and onset of infection averaging 30 months. the offending organisms were gram negative bacteria in three patients (klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens), gram positive bacteria in two (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans), and fungi in four (candida species in three and aspergillus species in one). gross examination of the explants revealed in most cases a vegetative endocarditis of one porcine valve leaflets. septic embolization occurred in five cases owing to the high friability of the vegetations. prosthetic valve incompetence was the commonest type to dysfunction  observed because of tears, perforations, and even complete destruction of the cusps. prosthetic valve stenosis following obstruction of the valve orifice by infected polypous masses was noted in two cases. clumps of infective organisms were detected deep in the cusp tissue in most cases on histologic examination. infection located on the paraprosthetic tissues, associated with ring abscess, valve detachment, and insufficiency, was observed only once. according to the results of investigation, endocarditis on porcine bioprostheses is associated with a better preserved native valvular ring as viewed at reoperation. therefore  surgical intervention appears appropriate in the presence of severe hemodynamic complications after adequate antibiotic treatment. however, infection of these particular prostheses still carries an extremely high mortality. in the present series, this poor outcome might be explained by the frequently associated septic  and thromboembolic events.

TI  == biochemical characteristics and identification of enterobacteriaceae isolated from meats.
AB  == the isolation and identification of 2,220 enterobacteriaceae from meats indicated that escherichia coli biotype i, enterobacter agglomerans, and serratia liquefaciens were the principal types to be differentiated in meats. citrobacter  freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter hafniae were also commonly identified. identification of isolates by the encise ii (roche diagnostics inc., nutley, n.j.) and minitek (bbl microbiology systems, cockeysville, md.) coding systems gave similar results with only 255 (11.5%) discrepancies in identity, but both systems required large numbers of supplementary tests for identification of the isolates. not only the distribution of enterobacteriaceae types isolated from meats but also some of the biochemical  reactions of the isolates differed from those of clinical isolates. the minitek technique is recommended because of its versatility. however, with the addition of cellobiose and salicin disks and the inclusion of methyl red to the minitek test and the use of the voges-proskauer test and gas production in ec medium at elevated temperature as standard tests, the identification of these enterobacteriaceae from meats would be greatly facilitated. the inclusion of the  motility test, for example, using nitrate motility agar, would also be of value to enterobacteriaceae identification.

AB  == cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the c.s.f. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae,  escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. compared to the m.i.c. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the c.s.f. are much higher than the m.i.c.'s. these results are comparable to those of previous studies. cefotaxime diffuses in the c.s.f. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against  haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol.
AB  == we evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sch 24893, sch 25298, and sch 25393, three novel analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. all of the analogs had minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 10 micrograms/ml for 18 chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant strains of shigella  dysenteriae and 21 strains of resistant salmonella typhi. the analogs were also more active than were chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol against chloramphenicol-resistant enteric bacteria, including six strains of escherichia  coli, seven strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, and two strains of enterobacter cloacae. fifty-three strains of ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae were  uniformly susceptible to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the three analogs. sch 25298 was the most active compound tested (minimal inhibitory concentration,  0.5 microgram/ml for all strains). four of seven chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant haemophilus strains were susceptible to the fluorinated analogs. of the three haemophilus strains which were resistant to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the analogs, two contained less than 10% of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity of the strains which were resistant to only chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. we conclude that fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol have considerable in vitro activity  against a broad spectrum of chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == four hundred and seventy klebsiella and 103 enterobacter strains derived from urogenital infections, upper respiratory tract and wound infections were examined. (i) k. aerogenes was the most common among klebsiella species, k. ozaenae and k. atlantae occurred frequently, k. pneumoniae, k. rhinoscleromatis,  k. edwardsii and k. oxytoca were found rarely. the strains isolated from urine showed the most heterogeneous species distribution. enterobacter species were in  the order of frequency e. cloacae, e. liquefaciens, e. aerogenes. (ii) k. aerogenes strains belonged to 10, k. atlantae strains to 6 phage types; phage type ii.a1 was the most frequent phage types. typability varied between 23.7% and 48.0% with the different klebsiella species, except k. edwardsii and k. oxytoca strains. none of the strains of these species were typable by phages. among the enterobacter species examined, only one e. liquefaciens strain was typable by phages. strains of genus enterobacter were lysed by the diagnostic phage c14 in 64%, no lysis was observed in the strains of genus klebsiella. (iii) multiple resistance was demonstrated in 36.6% of klebsiella strains and in 16.5% of enterobacter strains. the majority of the multiresistant strains was isolated from urine in both genera. multiresistant strains belonged to the species k. aerogenes, e. cloacae and e. liquefaciens. strains resistant to ampicillin were divided into 6 groups on the basis of cephaloridine and cephalothin resistance. the rate of multiresistant strains was higher among the klebsiella and enterobacter strains not typable by phages than in the typable ones.

TI  == a single medium for the isolation of acetylene-reducing (dinitrogen-fixing) bacteria from soils.
AB  == a single medium, containing standard basal salts and three common carbon sources  (sucrose, mannitol, and sodium lactate) is proposed to replace nitrogen-free media in common use for isolating dinitrogen-fixing bacteria. eight commonly isolated genera of dinitrogen-fixing bacterial exhibited growth on this combined  carbon medium that equalled or bettered growth on other carbon-containing media.  combined carbon medium also yielded the highest counts of putative dinitrogen-fixing bacteria from three southern alberta soils. a survey of the bacteria isolated aerobically from the burdett soil on combined carbon agar indicated that, at higher dilutions, 75% of the isolates exhibited acetylene reduction. these bacteria were identified as azospirillum spp., bacillus polymyxa, b. macerans, klebsiella pneumoniae, erwinia herbicola, and enterobacter cloacae. the inclusion of yeast extract in combined carbon medium is considered essential to supply organic growth factors and may supply "starter" nitrogen that promotes growth without inhibiting acetylene reduction.

TI  == dinitrogen-fixing bacteria: computer-assisted identification of soil isolates.
AB  == dinitrogen-fixing (acetylene-reducing) bacteria may be readily isolated from soils but extensive biochemical or immunobiological testing, or both, are required to identify them absolutely. a computer-assisted scheme for identification of nine genera of dinitrogen-fixing bacteria was developed and tested. the computer program is based on interpretation of the 70 biochemical tests of the api 20e and 50e, supplemented with tests for acetylene reduction, nitrate and nitrite reduction, catalase, oxidase, motility, and growth on macconkey's bile salt medium. dinitrogen-fixing enterobacteriaceae (klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and erwinia herbicola) were accurately identified using the data base in the api analytical profile index. nonenteric dinitrogen-fixing bacteria (azotobacter spp., azospirillum spp., derxia sp., rhodospirillum sp., clostridium sp., and bacillus spp.) were subjected to these tests to form a new data base for these bacteria. the api tests agreed with standard biochemical tests commonly used to identify these bacteria, were reproducible with time, and were sufficiently unique to permit accurate identification of each species. the use of the api 20e and 50e tests plus the additional seven tests with these known data bases permitted rapid and precise identification of acetylene reducing bacteria from various agricultural ecosystems.

AB  == single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to  determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. at heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 u/ml, the effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. all 10 isolates of s. aureus and all 10 of s. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 u/ml. three e. coli, four p. aeruginosa, and nine c. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 u of heparin per ml. none of the k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 u/ml. heparin inhibition  of s. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 u of heparin per ml could be  quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. these data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of cefoperazone (t-1551), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin.
AB  == cefoperazone, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it is as active as cefazolin and cefamandole against gram-positive bacteria and is more active than cefazolin and cefamandole against  such gram-negative bacilli as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and  serratia marcescens. the superiority of cefoperazone over cefazolin and cefamandole with respect to activity against p. aeruginosa by more than 200-fold  was especially remarkable. as with other beta-lactam antibiotics, there was only  a small spread between the minimum inhibitory concentrations and the minimum bactericidal concentrations of cefoperazone and a significant decrease in activity with an increase in inoculum size. activity was not altered significantly by the addition of human serum to the test medium. cefoperazone is  relatively stable to hydrolysis to beta-lactamases produced by gram-negative bacteria. relative rates of hydrolysis of cefoperazone by cephalosporinases are 7.0 to 0.01, with reference to cephaloridine hydrolysis (base, 100). cefoperazone is also more stable than penicillin g and cephaloridine to various types of penicillinases.

AB  == associative nitrogen fixation in kentucky bluegrass (poa pratensis l.) turfs inoculated with five nitrogen-fixing bacterial isolates was evaluated using the acetylene reduction assay and nitrogen accumulation as indicators of fixation. 'park' and 'nugget' kentucky bluegrass turfs were grown in controlled environment chambers and inoculated with klebsiella pneumoniae (w-2, w-6, and w-14), erwinia  herbicola (w-8), and enterobacter cloacae (w-11). 'park' inoculated with k. pneumoniae (w-6) had significant acetylene reduction activity using undisturbed turfs. other treatments including turfs treated with heat-killed cells had no significant difference in acetylene reduction. in a second study, "park' and 'south dakota certified' turfs were grown in a greenhouse and inoculated with k.  pneumoniae (w-6) and e. herbicola (w-8). 'park' inoculated with k. pneumoniae (w-6) had increased acetylene reduction activity rates and also a greater nitrogen accumulation in aerial tissues when compared to controls. acetylene reduction activity was correlated (r = 0.92) to nitrogen accumulation. other treatments did not effectively increase acetylene reduction activity or nitrogen  accumulation.

AB  == the competition of a number of beta-lactam morphogenic probes for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, proteus rettgeri, and escherichia coli has been studied. the results indicate that the various gram-negative bacteria have similar, but not identical, pbp patterns and that the individual proteins probably perform similar morphogenic functions as in e. coli k-12. comparison of  the 50% binding concentrations of the compounds for the various pbps of the five  strains with their antibacterial activity indicates that the different antibiotics are excluded to a greater or lesser degree by the outer membrane permeability barrier and that the exclusion is most pronounced in p. aeruginosa.

TI  == comparative bactericidal effect of ceforanide (bl-s 786) and five other cephalosporins in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of ceforanide was compared, in an in vitro kinetic model, with that of five other cephalosproins: cephalothin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin. cultures of various pathogens in 95% human serum were incubated for 12 hours in the presence of the cephalosporins whose concentrations were modified periodically-by addition of a concentrated solution of drug or dilution with unmedicated serum-in order to simulate the variation of antibiotic concentration in human blood after one-gram intramuscular dose. one gram-positive strain and six gram-negative strains were used. bactericidal activity was assessed by monitoring changes in the number of colony-forming units. tests showed that against klebsiella pneumoniae, ceforanide was the most active of the six cephalosporins. proteus mirabilis was more susceptible to ceforanide and cefuroxime than to the other compounds; enterobacter cloacae to ceforanide, cefuroxime, and cefamandole; escherichia coli to ceforanide, cefuroxime, cefamandole, and cefazolin. the number of viable cells of staphylococcus aureus was reduced below detectable levels by all cephalosporins except cefoxitin. on the other hand, providencia stuartii was virtually unaffected by all of the cephalosporins except cefoxitin.

TI  == comparison of assay of coliform enterotoxins by conventional techniques versus in vivo intestinal perfusion.

TI  == physical characterization of ten r plasmids obtained from an outbreak of nosocomial klebsiella pneumoniae infections.
AB  == gentamicin resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae involved in an outbreak at the minneapolis veterans administration hospital was due to a transmissible r plasmid. in addition to gentamicin, this plasmid conferred resistance to tobramycin, kanamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and sulfathiazole. r plasmids which transferred this complex antibiogram were identified in several clinical isolates, including four different serotypes of k. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus morganii. the covalently closed circular form of all r plasmids isolated had a sedimentation coefficient of 76s to 77s, corresponding to a molecular weight of 58 x 10(6). the possibility that a single r plasmid was responsible for the dissemination of multiple drug resistance among all of these different clinical strains was examined by characterizing the plasmids by using ecori restriction endonuclease.  the same 15 fragments were obtained from each of the 10 plasmids analyzed. their  molecular weights ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 11 x 10(6). thus, we conclude that each of the 10 plasmids present in the various clinical strains isolated from the hospital over a 7-month period originated from a common source and that r plasmid transfer was important in their spread.

AB  == the enterotoxigenicity of strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli, which represented the predominant coliform species isolated from the jejunum of 12 patients with tropical sprue and 5 with the blind-loop syndrome, was quantitatively assessed in terms of the ability of toxin preparations to induce water secretion as assayed by in-vivo perfusion in the rat jejunum. all 12 patients with sprue harboured 1 or more highly toxigenic strains--14 of the 16 strains isolated from this group produced heat-labile and/or heat-stable toxins which were as potent as toxins derived from strains isolated from persons with acute diarrhoea and documented as toxigenic. none of the 9 strains isolated from patients with the blind-loop syndrome produced potent toxins. this difference between the coliform bacteria in sprue and the blind-loop syndrome probably accounts, at least partly, for the different intestinal response in these two disorders to contamination by these organisms.

TI  == rapid enumeration of fecal coliforms in water by a colorimetric beta-galactosidase assay.
AB  == the colorimetric beta-galactosidase assay is based upon the enzymatic hydrolysis  of the substrate o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactoside (onpg) by fecal coliforms. this technique provides an estimate of the fecal coliform concentration within 8 to 20 h. a 100-ml portion of test sample was passed through a 0.45 micrometer membrane  filter. this filter was then incubated at 37 degrees c for 1 h in ec medium followed by the addition of filter-sterilized onpg. the incubation was continued  at 44.5 degrees c until a half-maximum absorbance (at 420 nm) was reached. the time between the start of incubation and the half-maximum absorbance was proportional to the concentration of fecal coliforms present. escherichia coli (k-12) was used to measure the kinetics of substrate hydrolysis and the response  time of different cell concentrations. high cell densities produced an immediate  response, whereas 1 cell/ml will produce a response in less than 20 h. in field studies in which samples were taken from a range of grossly polluted streams to relatively clean lake water, a linear correlation between onpg hydrolysis times and fecal coliform most-probable-number values was established. a total of 302 isolates randomly selected from positive onpg-ec media, which were derived from 11 different habitats, were identified as e. coli (96.69 percent), enterobacter cloacae (2.32 percent), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.66 percent), and citrobacter freundii (0.33 percent).

TI  == a microbiological investigation of acute summer gastroenteritis in black south african infants.
AB  == a microbiological investigation of black infants suffering from severe acute summer gastroenteritis revealed enteropathogenic agents in 30 out of 37 patients  (81%). enterotoxigenic bacteria were isolated from 15 patients (41%). a total of  16 enterotoxigenic strains were isolated, comprising 9 enterotoxigenic escherichia coli strains secreting labile and stable toxin on their own and in combination, and labile-toxin secreting strains of klebsiella pneumoniae (4), enterobacter cloacae (2) and proteus vulgaris (1). in the case of the latter three species, however, 6 out of the 7 strains were isolated from patients who were excreting other enteric pathogens, whereas only 2 out of 9 enterotoxigenic e. coli patients had concomitant infections with other pathogens. no invasive bacteria were isolated except for 2 shigella strains. salmonella and shigella strains were found in four patients. no correlation was found between the enteropathogenicity of e. coli and its serotype. rotavirus was observed by negative staining electron microscopy in only two patients (6%) but using a reverse complement fixation test rotavirus antigen was detected in the stool of 17 out of 35 patients (49%). the low em detection rate may well be due to the patients being admitted for treatment late in the course of their illness when the degree of viral shedding has decreased below em detectability. no significant difference in clinical presentation was noted between the various aetiological agents. only one patient was being solely breast-fed compared to 16% of control non-diarrhoeic infants. evidence of malnutrition was noted in over half of our patients.

TI  == intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  == several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. the following species: proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, providencia stuartii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -ii. several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.

TI  == coliforms from hides and meat.
AB  == coliform tests were performed on 85 hide and 75 meat samples. imvic reactions were determined on isolates from positive confirmed and fecal tests, and strains  other than escherichia coli were identified. strains typed as aerobacter aerogenes types i and ii were identified as enterobacter cloacae (51.4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (21.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (15%), and enterobacter liquefaciens, serratia, and unidentified coliforms (12.1%). k. pneumoniae appeared to be responsible for less than 1% positive fecal tests.

TI  == [approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  == in this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. this system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (ph-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (uripret-g). a total of 130 cultures was investigated. the employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. they included the following species: candida albicans, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus inconstans, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium. employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.

TI  == acetylene reduction (nitrogen fixation) by enterobacteriaceae isolated from paper mill process waters.
AB  == using selective media containing galactitol, over 130 enterobacteriaceae have been isolated from paper mill process waters collected from different localities. these bacteria were extensively characterized and tested for acetylene-reducing (nitrogen-fixing) activity under anaerobic conditions. high activity was found in representatives of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, erwinia herbicola, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter intermedius, and escherichia coli. under argon, nitrogenase synthesis was generally not repressed  by 5 mm l-glutamate, l-aspartate, l-leucine or casamino acids (0.5 g/liter). in many strains, both the specific activities (nanomoles of c(2)h(4) per minute per  milligram of protein) and the activities (nanomoles of c(2)h(4) per minute) had considerably declined after 24 h. in three selected strains, activity in intact cells grown under nitrogen was unaffected by the presence during assay of 10 mm l-amino acids or ammonium acetate. all of the strains examined were tolerant towards inactivation of nitrogen-fixing activity by 1.8% (vol/vol) oxygen during  assay, and inactivation by up to 10% oxygen was partly reversible. representatives of the six taxa synthesized nitrogenase in stirred aerobic cultures, though the protein concentrations attained were lower than under anaerobic conditions. it seems reasonable to suggest that under natural conditions, nitrogen fixation is able to contribute significantly to the nitrogen economy of the cells.

TI  == susceptibility of clinically important gram-negative bacilli to 15 antibiotics. comparison of patterns in poland and federal republic of germany.
AB  == three hundred and sixty strains of gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae, providencia, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens), were isolated by random in poland and germany, and tested by agar dilution method for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents, including  six cephalosporin derivatives, colistin, gentamycin and tobramycin, three newer tetracyclines, ampicillin and carbenicillin, and a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. this investigation revealed existence of growing antibiotic-resistance of gram-negative bacilli to all antimicrobial agents. a detailed analysis of this problem is described and a list of agents effective in  vitro is presented. some evidence has been found concerning possible existence of geographical differences in antibiotic-susceptibility patterns of strains of gram-negative bacilli, isolated in poland and federal republic of germany.

TI  == partial purification and properties of enterobacter cloacae heat-stable enterotoxin.
AB  == cell free preparations of the whole-cell lysate and ultrafiltration (uf) fractions of broth cultures of a strain of enterobacter cloacae, isolated from a  puerto rican with tropical sprue, were assayed for their ability to induce in vivo net water secretion in the rat jejunum. the whole-cell lysate and um-10 retentate of broth cultures were inactive. the um-2 retentate and filtrate were active at a concentration of 100 mug/ml or more; the toxigenic activity was entirely retained, and increased to 1 mug/ml, by a um-05 membrane; washing this retentate yielded a fraction with an activity of 10 ng/ml. stationary aerobic culture conditions yielded the most active uf fractions when ammonium sulfate was used as the precipitating agent, whereas anaerobic culture conditions produced the most active fractions in broth cultures precipitated by acetone. passage of the active acetone-precipitated uf fractions through a sephadex g-25 column yielded eluate pools with enhanced toxigenic activity in, or adjacent to, the void volume, but maximum activity of the ammonium sulfate-precipitated um-05 retentate eluated at a kav of 0.38 to 0.52. neither of the most active gel filtration elution fractions of the um-05 retentates contained detectable carbohydrate, suggesting that the toxin is not associated with endotoxin. toxigenic activity was unaltered by exposure to a temperature of 100c for 30 min, lowering the ph to 1, or incubation with either pronase or trypsin. these observations indicate that the strain of e. cloacae under study elaborates a heat-stable enterotoxin htat has approximately the same molecular weight and shares many of the characteristics of the heat-stable enterotoxin produced by some strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == laboratory studies with cefatrizine (sk + f 60771), a new broad-spectrum orally-active cephalosporin.
AB  == cefatrizine (sk&f 60771), a new orally-active semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, was compared with cephalexin and cefazolin for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic behavior in laboratory animals. the average mic values obtained with cefatrizine against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were superior to those obtained with cephalexin and somewhat poorer than those of cefazolin. in addition, a large percentage of the enterobacter and enterococcus isolates were found to be susceptible. cefatrizine had a longer biological half-life and a higher peak serum level than either cefazolin or cephalexin when administered parenterally or orally to mice at 20 mg/kg. it had striking in vivo protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, hemophilus influenzae, proteus morganii or staphylococcus aureus reflecting its superior pharmacokinetic profile in this animal species. a  variable pharmacokinetic response between animal species was observed when cefatrizine was administered either orally or parenterally to dogs, squirrel monkeys or rabbits.

TI  == massive empyema due to citrobacter diversus.
AB  == citrobacter diversus is a gram-negative rod member of the enterobacteriacease family. a patient is described from whom this organism was isolated twice in pure culture from empyema fluid. our isolates of citrobacter diversus were resistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin and sensitive to cephalothin. citrobacter diversus should be distinguished from citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae  and klebsiella pneumoniae. this organism joins streptococcus pyogenes, bacteroids species, anaerobic streptococci and escherichia coli as a cause of slight pneumonia with extensive empyema.

TI  == membrane filter procedure for enumerating the component genera of the coliform group in seawater.
AB  == a facile, quantitative, membrane filter procedure (mc) for defining the distribution of coliform populations in seawater according to the component genera was developed. the procedure, which utilizes a series of in situ substrate tests to obviate the picking of colonies for identification, also provides an estimate of the total coliform density. when pure cultures of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae were suspended in seawater and held at 4 c for 24 h, between 56 and 100% of the cells which grew on nutrient agar spread plates at 35 c could be recovered by the mc procedure. confirmation as coliforms of typical colonies from natural samples was about 95%. assay variability was found to be insignificant. the recovery of coliforms from marine  waters by the mc procedure was comparable to those obtainable by current methods. klebsiella was differentiated by the urease reaction and e. coli by its ability to form indole. the confirmation frequencies for colonies designated as klebsiella and e. coli by the in situ tests approached 95% for the former and 98% for the latter.

TI  == in-use contamination of intravenous infusion fluid.
AB  == during the 1970 to 1971 nationwide epidemic of septicemias caused by enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter agglomerans traced to intrinsic contamination of abbott  intravenous infusion products, 94 infusion systems manufactured by baxter laboratories were studied microbiologically and epidemiologically during hospital use. intravenous fluid from 10 systems (11%) contained microorganisms, usually staphylococcus or bacillus species; one infusion was heavily contaminated with klebsiella pneumoniae. no national epidemic organisms, e. cloacae or e. agglomerans (formerly erwinia), were recovered, suggesting that during this period frequent contamination with these organisms was unique to abbott's infusion products. contamination in this study appeared to be extrinsic in origin (introduced during clinical use) and related to the duration of continuous intravenous therapy. nine of 61 systems (15%) that had been used longer than 48 h were contaminated, whereas only 1 of 33 used less than 48 h (3%) contained microorganisms. this study and the recent national outbreak indicate that contamination of infusion fluid, both from intrinsic and extrinsic sources, must  be recognized as an additional risk of intravenous therapy; however, a once-daily replacement of the delivery apparatus can significantly diminish this hazard.

TI  == transferrable resistance to tobramycin in klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter  cloacae associated with enzymatic acetylation of tobramycin.
AB  == among gram-negative bacilli isolated from burn wound cultures, some strains of enterobacteriaceae were resistant to tobramycin (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic]>/= 20 mug/ml) but susceptible to gentamicin (mic </= 5 mug/ml). one klebsiella pneumoniae and two enterobacter cloacae strains were selected for studies on their mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. resistance to high concentrations of tobramycin (mics of 25 to 50 mug/ml) was conjugally transferred to a susceptible escherichia coli strain at rates of 1.2 x 10(-4) to 2.8 to 10(-4) per donor cell, suggesting that resistance is controlled  by r factors. resistances to tobramycin, kanamycin, and neomycin were cotransferred. enzymatic activities were present that acetylated tobramycin, gentamicin, and kanamycin in osmotic lysates from the donor and transcipient strains. enzymatic adenylylation of these aminoglycosides was not observed. the aminoglycoside-acetylating activities from k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae resembled kanamycin acetyltransferase (kat) in their specificity for aminoglycoside substrates. not all isolates of bacteria that produce kat are resistant to tobramycin, but the factors that determine susceptibility or resistance to tobramycin in kat-producing bacteria have not yet been established.

TI  == comparison of the chemotherapeutic and pharmacodynamic activities of cephradine,  cephalothin, and cephaloridine in mice.
AB  == cephradine, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative, is 7[d(-)-2-amino-2-(1,4-cyclohexadien-1-yl) acetamido]-3-methyl-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid hydrate. the compound has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro. when given subcutaneously to mice, cephradine was appreciably more effective than cephalothin against infections induced by penicillinase-producing staphylococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, or enterobacter cloacae strains. cephradine and cephaloridine possessed equivalent activity in treating infections caused by these same three gram-negative bacteria. the mean total bioactivity of  cephradine in the serum of mice peaked within 30 min (59 mug/ml) after parenteral administration and was approximately threefold that of cephalothin (20 mug/ml), but less than that of cephaloridine (83 mug/ml). nearly all of the administered cephradine (84%) and cephaloridine (70%) were excreted in the urine as the parent compounds. in contrast, only 47% (total bioactivity) of administered cephalothin  was recovered, an amount that represented only 15 to 20% of the parent substance.

TI  == comparison of the substrate specificities of the -lactamases from klebsiella aerogenes 1082e and enterobacter cloacae p99.
AB  == a potent beta-lactamase (ec 3.5.2.6) produced by a strain of klebsiella aerogenes (k. pneumoniae), 1082e, isolated from a hospital patient, has been examined. its  properties were different from those of most gram-negative beta-lactamases previously reported. the enzyme has been partly purified, and its activity against a range of substrates has been compared with that of the enzyme from enterobacter cloacae (aerobacter cloacae) p99. the k. aerogenes enzyme, although  predominantly a penicillinase, had a wide range of specificity. in addition to hydrolyzing the cephalosporins, it attacked the normally beta-lactamaseresistant  compounds methicillin and cloxacillin as well as cephalosporin analogues with the same acyl substituents. the results obtained with the e. cloacae enzyme confirmed its cephalosporinase activity and showed that, unlike the enzyme from k. aerogenes, it was relatively inactive against the penicillins.

TI  == nitrogen-deficient medium in the differential isolation of klebsiella and enterobacter from feces.
AB  == on a nitrogen-deficient agar medium, the tribe klebsielleae formed large, glistening, mucoid colonies which were easily distinguished from other colony types. of 113 klebsielleae isolates from human feces which were characterized, klebsiella accounted for 88% of the total; 75% were k. pneumoniae; k. ozaenae (13%) was isolated from one individual only. the remaining strains (12%) were identified as enterobacter cloacae. counts (for the tribe) ranged from 10(2) to 10(6), with a median of 10(4); 9 of 53 stool specimens were negative. k. pneumoniae was also isolated from 6 of 41 frozen foil-pack foods. anaerobic studies at room temperature and 37 c revealed no appreciable differences from aerobic plates. the nitrogen-deficient medium appeared better than e m b for isolation of klebsielleae when they were present in low numbers relative to other coliforms; slime production by klebsielleae concomitant with minimal growth of other bacteria is involved.

TI  == effect of naturally occurring xanthines on bacteria. i. antimicrobial action and  potentiating effect on antibiotic spectra.
AB  == the effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. the antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. the effect was both bacteriostatic and  bactericidal against susceptible organisms. the susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. the morphology of aerobacter  aerogenes and a. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. this potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.
