TI  == synthesis and biological evaluation of novel leucomycin analogues modified at the c-3 position. i. epimerization and methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group.
AB  == the synthesis and biological evaluation of sixteen-membered macrolides modified at the c-3 position are described. 3-epi-leucomycin a7 (9), 3-o-acyl-3-epi-leucomycin a7 analogues (11a-11e), 3-o-acylleucomycin a7 analogues (13b-13e) and 3-o-methylleucomycin analogues (16a, 16b and 22) were synthesized via fully protected intermediates (7, 5a, 5b and 20). after appropriate modification, subsequent deprotections were performed to furnish a variety of leucomycin analogues. methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group was found to improve the pharmacoprofile of leucomycin antibiotics. 3-o-methylrokitamycin (16b) showed enhanced antibacterial activity in vitro and 3,3''-di-o-methyl-4''-o-(3-methylbutyl)leucomycin v (22) exhibited improved metabolic stability in rat plasma in vitro.

TI  == [pharmacokinetics of cefoperazone concentration in human lung tissue].
AB  == in 11 patients, the concentration of cefoperazone (cpz) in the lung tissue were studied after a 2 g intravenous bolus injection. samples of lung tissue and blood were taken during surgery at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after administration of cpz. all samples were assayed by the paper disc method using micrococcus luteus atcc 9341 as the indicator strain. all assay results of lung tissue were corrected for the amount of blood contained in the tissue samples by  the hemoglobin content in the homogenate of lung tissue. the cpz levels in the lung tissue were 116.2 micrograms/g at 15 min., 94.1 micrograms/g at 30 min., 74.6 micrograms/g at 60 min., 67.9 micrograms/g at 120 min., 54.6 micrograms/g at 180 min., 29.2 micrograms/g at 240 min. and 22.7 micrograms/g at 300 min. after administration, respectively. these values were higher than mic90 values of cpz for pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and  enterobacteriaceae. the level of cpz in the lung tissue was higher than 50% of the level in the serum until 180 minutes after administration of cpz.

TI  == differentiation among closely related organisms of the actinobacillus-haemophilus-pasteurella group by means of lysozyme and edta.
AB  == bacteriolysis in tris-maleate buffer (0.005 m, ph 7.2) supplemented with edta (0.01 m) and hen egg white lysozyme (hewl, 1.0 microgram/ml) was set up to assist differentiation between the taxonomically closely related actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and haemophilus aphrophilus. a. actinomycetemcomitans was more sensitive to lysis in this system than h. aphrophilus. the standard method for bacteriolysis separated the 10 tested strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans into two groups (i and ii) based on their lysis patterns, whereas the 7 strains of h. aphrophilus examined were homogeneous. in group i of a. actinomycetemcomitans, edta displayed a considerable lytic effect, which was not  increased by supplementation with hewl. in group ii, the lytic effect of edta was much less, but hewl had a considerable supplementary lytic effect. when the turbidity of a. actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 29522) or h. aphrophilus (atcc 33389) suspended in tris buffer was monitored at close ph intervals (0.2) from ph 5.2 to 9.2, maximal lysis of atcc 29522 occurred with edta at ph 8.0 and with edta-hewl  at ph 7.6, while atcc 33389 lysed with edta at ph 9.0 and with edta-hewl at ph 9.2. when other members of the family pasteurellaceae (haemophilus influenzae type b, haemophilus paraphrophilus, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, and pasteurella ureae) were included for comparison, the group i strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans were the most rapidly lysed by edta. h. paraphrophilus was the least sensitive of the gram-negative strains tested, but not as resistant as micrococcus luteus (control). m. luteus was the organism most sensitive to lysozyme, followed by p. ureae and the group ii strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, while the group i strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, h.  paraphrophilus, and p. haemolytica were the least sensitive organisms.

TI  == endonuclease from micrococcus luteus which has activity toward ultraviolet-irradiated deoxyribonucleic acid: its action on transforming deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  == an endonuclease purified from micrococcus luteus makes single-strand breaks in ultraviolet (uv)-irradiated, native deoxyribonucleic acid (dna). the purified endonuclease is able to reactivate uv-inactivated transforming dna of haemophilus influenzae, especially when the dna is assayed on a uv-sensitive mutant of h. influenzae. after extensive endonuclease action, there is a loss of transforming  dna when assayed on both uv-sensitive and -resistant cells. the endonuclease does not affect unirradiated dna. the results indicate that the endonuclease function  is involved in the repair of biological damage resulting from uv irradiation and  that the uv-sensitive mutant is deficient in this step. we interpret the data as  indicating that the various steps in the repair of dna must be well coordinated if repair is to be effective.
