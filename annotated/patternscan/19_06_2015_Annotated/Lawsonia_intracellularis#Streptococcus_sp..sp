TI  == exposure of feral swine (sus scrofa) in the united states to selected pathogens.
AB  == feral swine (sus scrofa) are widely distributed in the united states. in 2011 and 2012, serum samples and tonsils were recovered from 162 and 37 feral swine, respectively, in the us to evaluate exposure to important swine endemic pathogens. antibodies against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) and porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv2) were found in 2.5% and 25.3% of tested sera, respectively. positive serological reactions against mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae have been detected in 19.7% and 69.7% of animals. more than 15% of animals presented antibodies against these 2 pathogens simultaneously. most animals were also seropositive for lawsonia intracellularis. feral swine can also be involved in transmission of zoonotic agents. almost 50% of animals possessed antibodies against salmonella. in addition, 94.4% of animals were carriers of streptococcus suis in their tonsils.  in conclusion, feral swine may be considered as a potential reservoir for different endemic diseases in domestic pigs, as well as for important zoonotic agents.

TI  == the microbiota of pigs influenced by diet texture and severity of lawsonia intracellularis infection.
AB  == pigs with and without naturally occurring lawsonia intracellularis infection were fed diets with different texture. in a previous study from 79 pig herds using a similar feeding on pelleted or non-pelleted form showed that the non-pelleted diet was associated with a reduced prevalence of l. intracellularis. in this study a mechanistic approach was taken for explaining and testing this observation by studying the microbiota and the occurrence of l. intracellularis in the distal ileum of 54 pigs by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis, real-time pcr and in situ hybridization. the texture of the diet influenced the microbiota, and from a quantitative discriminative analysis of the terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) of ileum samples it was deduced that clostridium spp. and lactobacillus spp. were associated with the non-pelleted diet and streptococcus spp. with the pelleted diet. in experimentally infected pigs it was verified that 89bp and 90bp sized t-rfs (hhai) from ileum represented l. intracellularis. the non-pelleted diet seemed to reduce the relative amount of l. intracellularis in the total microbiota of the ileum, but the number of pigs detected positive with l. intracellularis by real-time pcr was not influenced. the five pigs with highest l. intracellularis content showed t-rfs that were not present in profiles from less or non-infected pigs, which may indicate that some bacterial species were associated with l. intracellularis infection.

TI  == survey of the large-animal diplomates of the american college of veterinary internal medicine regarding knowledge and clinical use of polymerase chain reaction: implications for veterinary education.
AB  == a questionnaire was developed to document the knowledge base of large-animal diplomates of the american college of veterinary internal medicine (acvim) regarding polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technology and to identify the common use of this technology in equine practice. ninety-three of the 278 mailed questionnaires were returned, for an overall response rate of 33.4%. ninety respondents (99%) reported being familiar with the general principles of nucleic  acid probe technology; however, only 52 (57%) knew the difference between conventional (traditional) and real-time (second-generation) pcr. the majority of the respondents (88%) emphasized the need for continuing education on molecular diagnostics. eighty-four (92%) of the respondents regularly use pcr (conventional and/or real-time) for the detection of equine pathogens, and 80 (88%) commonly submit their samples to university/state veterinary laboratories. blood, nasal swabs, and feces are the three equine specimens most commonly submitted for pcr analysis of streptococcus equi, lawsonia intracellularis, neorickettsia risticii, equine herpesvirus 1/4, rhodococcus equi, sarcocystis neurona, and equine influenza virus. diplomates reported costs associated with molecular diagnostics  and unreliability of pcr as the most common limitations of pcr. didactic training in veterinary curricula and during continuing-education opportunities continues to be necessary to produce veterinarians who have an understanding of the clinical applications of molecular diagnostics.

TI  == human inflammatory bowel disease does not associate with lawsonia intracellularis infection.
AB  == background: there is increasing evidence that bacterial infection of the intestinal mucosa may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd). in pigs, an obligate intracellular bacterium, lawsonia intracellularis (li), was shown to cause proliferative enteropathy (pe) of which  some forms display histological and clinical similarities to human ibd. since li-similar desulfovibrio spp. may infect human cells, we hypothesized that li might be associated with the development of human ibd. results: in human intestinal tissue samples, pcr using llg, 50sl27, lsa and strictly li-specific 16sii primers, yielded either no amplicons or products with weak homology to human genomic sequences. sequencing of these amplicons revealed no specificity for li. however, amplification of dna with less specific 16si primers resulted in products bearing homology to certain streptococcus species. these 16si-amplified  products were present in healthy and diseased specimens, without obvious prevalence. conclusion: li is not associated with the pathogenesis of uc or cd. whether an immunologic response to commensal bacteria such as streptococci may contribute to the chronic inflammatory condition in ibd, remained to be determined.
