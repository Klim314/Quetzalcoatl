TI  == changes in cystic fibrosis airway microbial community associated with a severe decline in lung function.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) is a genetic disease resulting in chronic polymicrobial infections of the airways and progressive decline in lung function. to gain insight into the underlying causes of severe lung diseases, we aimed at comparing the airway microbiota detected in sputum of cf patients with stable lung function (s) versus those with a substantial decline in lung function (sd). microbiota composition was investigated by using culture-based and culture-independent methods, and by performing multivariate and statistical analyses. culture-based methods identified some microbial species associated with a worse lung function,  i.e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, rothia mucilaginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae and candida albicans, but only the presence of s. pneumoniae and r. mucilaginosa was  found to be associated with increased severe decline in forced expiratory volume  in 1 second (fev1). terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis revealed a higher bacterial diversity than that detected by culture-based methods. molecular signatures with a statistically significant odds ratio for sd status were detected, and classified as pseudomonas, burkholderia and shewanella, while for other terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) no species assignation was achieved. the analysis of t-rflp data using ecological biodiversity indices showed reduced evenness in sd patients compared to s ones, suggesting an impaired ecology of the bacterial community in sd patients. statistically significant differences of the ecological biodiversity indices among the three sub-groups of fev1 (normal/mild vs moderate vs severe) were also  found, suggesting that the patients with moderate lung disease experienced changes in the airway assembly of taxa. overall, changes in cf airway microbial community associated with a severe lung function decline were detected, allowing  us to define some discriminatory species as well as some discriminatory t-rfs that represent good candidates for the development of predictive biomarkers of substantial decline in lung function.

TI  == breath gas metabolites and bacterial metagenomes from cystic fibrosis airways indicate active ph neutral 2,3-butanedione fermentation.
AB  == the airways of cystic fibrosis (cf) patients are chronically colonized by patient-specific polymicrobial communities. the conditions and nutrients available in cf lungs affect the physiology and composition of the colonizing microbes. recent work in bioreactors has shown that the fermentation product 2,3-butanediol mediates cross-feeding between some fermenting bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and that this mechanism increases bacterial current production. to examine bacterial fermentation in the respiratory tract, breath gas metabolites were measured and several metagenomes were sequenced from cf and  non-cf volunteers. 2,3-butanedione was produced in nearly all respiratory tracts. elevated levels in one patient decreased during antibiotic treatment, and breath  concentrations varied between cf patients at the same time point. some patients had high enough levels of 2,3-butanedione to irreversibly damage lung tissue. antibiotic therapy likely dictates the activities of 2,3-butanedione-producing microbes, which suggests a need for further study with larger sample size. sputum microbiomes were dominated by p. aeruginosa, streptococcus spp. and rothia mucilaginosa, and revealed the potential for 2,3-butanedione biosynthesis. genes  encoding 2,3-butanedione biosynthesis were disproportionately abundant in streptococcus spp, whereas genes for consumption of butanedione pathway products  were encoded by p. aeruginosa and r. mucilaginosa. we propose a model where low oxygen conditions in cf lung lead to fermentation and a decrease in ph, triggering 2,3-butanedione fermentation to avoid lethal acidification. we hypothesize that this may also increase phenazine production by p. aeruginosa, increasing reactive oxygen species and providing additional electron acceptors to cf microbes.

TI  == mechanistic model of rothia mucilaginosa adaptation toward persistence in the cf  lung, based on a genome reconstructed from metagenomic data.
AB  == the impaired mucociliary clearance in individuals with cystic fibrosis (cf) enables opportunistic pathogens to colonize cf lungs. here we show that rothia mucilaginosa is a common cf opportunist that was present in 83% of our patient cohort, almost as prevalent as pseudomonas aeruginosa (89%). sequencing of lung microbial metagenomes identified unique r. mucilaginosa strains in each patient,  presumably due to evolution within the lung. the de novo assembly of a near-complete r. mucilaginosa (cf1e) genome illuminated a number of potential physiological adaptations to the cf lung, including antibiotic resistance, utilization of extracellular lactate, and modification of the type i restriction-modification system. metabolic characteristics predicted from the metagenomes suggested r. mucilaginosa have adapted to live within the microaerophilic surface of the mucus layer in cf lungs. the results also highlight the remarkable evolutionary and ecological similarities of many cf pathogens; further examination of these similarities has the potential to guide patient care and treatment.
