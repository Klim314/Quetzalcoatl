TI  - The inhibitory effect of polyphenols on human gut microbiota.
AB  - The intestinal microbiota (IM) is responsible for metabolism of many compounds provided in the diet, such as polyphenols, increasing their bioavailability. However, there are remarkably few studies investigating the influence of polyphenols on the composition and activity of the gut microbial community. This study evaluated the influence of the polyphenols naringenin (N), naringin (NR), hesperetin (H), hesperidin (HR), quercetin (Q), rutin (QR), and catechin (CAT) on the growth of human IM representatives (Bacteroides galacturonicus, Lactobacillus sp., Enterococcus caccae, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Ruminococcus gauvreauii, Escherichia coli). Polyphenols were added to liquid medium at a final concentration of 20, 100 or 250 mug/ml (for Q concentrations were 4, 20 or 50 mug/ml) and their impact on the IM was assessed by measurement of the turbidity after 24-h culture. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for polyphenols that inhibited bacteria was estimated. CAT had no impact on the tested IM. Q had the strongest impact on R. gauvreauii, B. galacturonicus and Lactobacillus sp. (MIC 20-50 mug/ml) growth, whilst its rutinoside had no impact. NR and HR had no impact, but their aglycones N and H inhibited growth of almost all analyzed bacteria (MIC >/=250 mug/ml). We conclude that flavonoid aglycones, but not their glycosides, may inhibit growth of some intestinal bacteria. This means that polyphenols probably can modulate the IM and indirectly interfere with their own bioavailability.
TI  - Bacteroides stercorirosoris sp. nov. and Bacteroides faecichinchillae sp. nov., isolated from chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera) faeces.
AB  - Strains of gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated from chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera) faeces, and three strains, ST161(T), ST33 and ST37(T), were investigated taxonomically. Based on phylogenetic analyses and specific phenotypic characteristics, the three strains were allocated to the genus Bacteroides. Phylogenetic analyses of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain ST161(T) formed a distinct line of descent, with highest sequence similarity to strain ST33 (98.7 %) and Bacteroides oleiciplenus JCM 16102(T) (97.7 %). High levels of DNA-DNA relatedness (79-89 %) were found between strains ST161(T) and ST33, but low levels were found between strain ST161(T) and B. oleiciplenus JCM 16102(T) (33-37 %) and between strain ST33 and B. oleiciplenus JCM 16102(T) (33-37 %). These data clearly indicated that strains ST161(T) and ST33 represent a single novel species. 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses showed that strain ST37(T) also formed a distinct line of descent, with highest sequence similarity to Bacteroides acidifaciens JCM 10556(T) (96.5 %) and Bacteroides caccae JCM 9498(T) (95.6 %). Analysis of hsp60 gene sequences also supported these relationships. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, two novel species, Bacteroides stercorirosoris sp. nov. and Bacteroides faecichinchillae sp. nov., are thus proposed. The type strains of B. stercorirosoris and B. faecichinchillae are ST161(T) ( = JCM 17103(T) = CCUG 60872(T)) and ST37(T) ( = JCM 17102(T) = CCUG 60873(T)), respectively. The DNA G+C contents of strains ST161(T) and ST37(T) were 45.7 and 41.0 mol%, respectively.
TI  - Design of species-specific oligonucleotide probes for the detection of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides by fluorescence in situ hybridization and their application to the analysis of mouse caecal Bacteroides-Parabacteroides microbiota.
AB  - AIMS: To develop species-specific monitoring techniques for rapid detection of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides inhabiting the mouse intestine by fluorescence in situ hybridization. METHODS AND RESULTS: The specificity of oligonucleotide probes was evaluated by fluorescence whole-cell hybridization. Oligonucleotide probes specific for each species hybridized only with the target bacteria. Using these probes, caecal Bacteroides-Parabacteroides microbiota of conventional mice and specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice from three different breeders were analysed. It was shown that Bacteroides acidifaciens Group-1, Group-2 and Group-3 were dominant in conventional mice and SPF mice from two out of three breeders. Bacteroides vulgatus and Parabacteroides distasonis were detected in one of these two SPF breeding colonies in addition to Bact. acidifaciens. SPF mice of the remaining breeder harboured characteristic Bacteroides-Parabacteroides microbiota, consisting of Bacteroides sp. ASF519 and Bacteroides caccae. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteroides acidifaciens is the dominant and most typical species in the mouse Bacteroides-Parabacteroides microbiota. The Group-3 was identified as a novel group and revealed to occupy a major niche together with Bact. acidifaciens Group-1 and Group-2. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The species-specific probe set developed in this study was the efficient tool for rapid detection of target bacterial groups inhabiting the mouse intestine. The results of this study provide important new information on the mouse Bacteroides-Parabacteroides community.
