TI  == effects of enteric-coated lactoferrin tablets containing lactobacillus brevis subsp. coagulans on fecal properties, defecation frequency and intestinal microbiota of japanese women with a tendency for constipation: a randomized placebo-controlled crossover study.
AB  == the effects of oral administration of enteric-coated tablets containing lactoferrin (lf; 100 mg/tablet) and heat-killed lactobacillus brevis subsp. coagulans frem bp-4693 (lb; 6x10(9) bacteria/tablet) on fecal properties were examined in 32 japanese women (20-60 years of age) with a tendency for constipation (defecation frequency at equal to or less than 10 times/2 weeks) by  a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. a significant increase in defecation days per week was obserbed in the subjects who ingested the tablets containing lf and lb compared with the placebo group. the number of bifidobacteria in feces also significantly increased compared with the placebo group. in an in vitro study, lf and tryptic hydrolysate of lf, but not peptic hydrolysate of lf, upregulated the growth of bifidobacterium longum atcc15707 when added to the culture. these results demonstrate the capability of the enteric-coated tablets containing lf and lb in improving intestinal function and  suggest that they have a growth promoting function for bifidobacteria.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. methods and results: probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. bif. longum b6 (53.6%) and lact. rhamnosus gg (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in ped. acidilactici (10.4%). bifidobacterium longum b6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), shigella boydii (42.0%) and staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). lactobacillus rhamnosus gg had the strong binding ability to caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, sh. boydii and staph. aureus to caco-2  cells. the hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and  competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion  and in vivo colonization. conclusion: the results suggest that bif. longum b6 and lact. rhamnosus gg can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. significance and impact of the study: because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the gi tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.

TI  == evaluation of anti-colitic effect of lactic acid bacteria in mice by cdna microarray analysis.
AB  == to evaluate the anti-colitic effect of lactic acid bacteria by cdna microarray analysis, a lactic acid bacteria mixture (lm) consisting of lactobacillus brevis  hy7401, l. suntoryeus hy7801 and bifidobacterium longum hy8004 was orally administered to dextran sulfate (dss)-induced colitic mice and the expression profile of numerous genes was assessed. dss treatment caused colitic outcomes such as inflammation and colon shortening. dss also up-regulated the expression of inflammation-related genes: pro-inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, including il-1beta, tnf-alpha, il-6, ccl2, ccl4, ccl7, ccl24, cxcl1, cxcl2, cxcl5, cxcl9 and cxcl10, and their receptors ccr3 and ccr7, and other colitis-related genes such as cox-2, pap, mmp family, s100a8, s100a9 and defa1. lm treatment inhibited the mrna expression of inflammation-related and tissue remodeling genes induced by dss as well as the colitic symptoms. lm inhibition for the dss-induced expression of the representative inflammatory markers, il-1beta, tnf-alpha and cox-2, was supported by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. these findings suggest that lm ameliorates dss-induced colitis by regulating inflammatory-related cytokines as well as tissue remodeling genes.

TI  == kinetics of microbial hydrogenation of free linoleic acid to conjugated linoleic  acids.
AB  == aims: to investigate the ability of selected probiotic bacterial strains to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and also to estimate the biohydrogenation  kinetics of lactobacillus acidophilus on the production of cla from free linoleic acid (la). methods and results: six probiotic bacteria, lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus gg, lact. acidophilus adh, and bifidobacterium longum b6, lact. brevis, and lact. casei, were used to examine their ability to convert la to cla. la tolerance was evaluated by addition of different la concentrations in mrs broth.  lact. acidophilus showed the major tolerant to la and the greatest cla-producing  ability (36-48 microg ml(-1) of cla). the rate-controlling steps were k(2) and k(1) for the addition of 1 and 3 mg ml(-1) of la, respectively. the percentage of cla conversion was higher in mrs broth supplemented with 1 mg ml(-1) (65%) than 3 mg ml(-1) (26%). conclusion: the results provide useful information and new approach for understanding the biohydrogenation mechanisms of cla production. significance and impact of the study: this study would help elucidate the pathway from la to stearic acid (sa), known as biohydrogenation. in addition, the use of  selected probiotic bacteria might lead to a significant improvement in food safety.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species from the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == one hundred and twenty-two strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species have been tested against 12 antibiotics and two antibiotic mixtures by a commercial system (sensititre anaero3; treck diagnostic systems). the upper limits of some minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were completed on mrs agar plates by the nccls procedure. all strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol and imipenem and most of the strains were resistant to metronidazole. bifidobacteria isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin, whereas about half of the  lactobacilli were resistant. approximately 30% of the bifidobacterium isolates were resistant to tetracycline, as well as five lactobacillus strains belonging to four different species. none of the tested bifidobacterium isolates was resistant to vancomycin, whereas a species-dependent resistance was found among the lactobacilli. single strains of bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus brevis were resistant to erythromycin and/or clindamycin. most of the observed resistances seemed to be intrinsic, but some others could be compatible with transmissible determinants.

TI  == hepatoprotective effect of lactic acid bacteria, inhibitors of beta-glucuronidase production against intestinal microflora.
AB  == the hepatoprotective activity of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus brevis hy7401, lactobacillus acidophilus csg and bifidobacterium longum hy8001), which inhibited beta-glucuronidase productivity of intestinal microflora, on t-bhp- or  ccl4-induced hepatotoxicity of mice were evaluated. these oral administration of  lactic acid bacteria lowered beta-glucuronidase production of intestinal microflora as well as escherichia coli hgu-3. when lactic acid bacteria at a dose of 0.5 or 2 g (wet weight)/kg was orally administered on ccl4-induced liver injury in mice, these bacteria significantly inhibited the increase of plasma alanine transferase and aspartate transferase activities by 17-57% and 57-66% of  the ccl4 control group, respectively. these lactic acid bacteria also showed the  potent hepatoprotective effect against t-bhp-induced liver injury in mice. the inhibitory effects of these lactic acid bacteria were more potent than that of dimethyl diphenyl bicarboxylate (ddb), which have been used as a commercial hepatoprotective agent. among these lactic acid bacteria, l. acidophilus csg exhibited the most potent hepatoprotective effect. based on these findings, we insist that an inhibitor of beta-glucuronidase production in intestine, such as lactic acid bacteria, may be hepatoprotective.

TI  == influence of two infant formulas and human milk on the development of the faecal  flora in newborn infants.
AB  == the establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on  breast milk (n = 20) or with two different modern adapted cow's milk formulas (n  = 19) was studied during the first 3 months of life. one formula investigated was based on 100% bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40. a faecal flora  rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups; the growth of putrefactive  bacteria (especially bacteroides spp.), however, was limited. in formula-fed infants, significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants. similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve constituted  the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding. other bifidobacterial species such as b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. parabifidum and b. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants. the latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well. it seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning lactobacillus spp. (especially l. fermentum and l. brevis).
