TI  == two multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis carry a novel metronidazole resistance nim gene (nimj).
AB  == two multidrug-resistant bacteroides fragilis clinical isolates contain and express a novel nim gene, nimj, that is not recognized by the "universal" nim primers and can confer increased resistance to metronidazole when introduced into a susceptible strain on a multicopy plasmid. hmw615, an appendiceal isolate, contains at least two copies of nimj on its genome, while hmw616, an isolate from a patient with sepsis, contains one genomic copy of nimj. b. fragilis nimj is phylogenetically closer to prevotella baroniae nimi and clostridium botulinum nima than to the other known bacteroides nim proteins. the predicted protein structure of nimj, based on fold recognition analysis, is consistent with the crystal structures derived for known nim proteins, and specific amino acid residues important for substrate binding in the active site are conserved. this study demonstrates that the "universal" nim primers will not detect all nim genes with the ability to confer metronidazole resistance, but nimj alone cannot account for the very high metronidazole mics of these resistant clinical isolates.

TI  == infant botulism: first two confirmed cases in slovenia and literature review.
AB  == in europe, infant botulism is a rare but probably under-diagnosed disease. with the intent to spread the awareness of this potentially life-threatening disease,  we present a review of the literature with the emphasis on european epidemiology  and a practical approach to diagnosis. we also report the first two confirmed cases of infant botulism in slovenia and describe our way to the final diagnosis  in a clinical setting where all appropriate diagnostic tests and treatment options are not readily available. the second case is particularly interesting, presenting with profound diarrhea following initial constipation, an unlikely symptom for an infant with botulism and possibly caused by bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == bacterial toxins modifying the actin cytoskeleton.
AB  == numerous bacterial toxins recognize the actin cytoskeleton as a target. the clostridial binary toxins (iota and c2 families) adp-ribosylate the actin monomers causing the dissociation of the actin filaments. the large clostridial toxins from clostridium difficile, clostridium sordellii and clostridium novyi inactivate, by glucosylation, proteins from the rho family that regulate actin polymerization. in contrast, the cytotoxic necrotic factor from escherichia coli  activates rho by deamidation and increases the formation of actin filaments. the  enterotoxin of bacteroides fragilis is a protease specific for e-cadherin and it  promotes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. the bacterial toxins that  modify the actin cytoskeleton induce various cell disfunctions including changes  in cell barrier permeability and disruption of intercellular junctions.

TI  == clostridial infection in children.
AB  == a survey of the isolation of clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. the isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified clostridium spp., 37 (33%) c. perfringens, 13 (12%) c. ramosum, five (4%) c. innocuum, six (5%) c. botulinum, three (3%) c. difficile, two (2%) c. butyricum, and one isolate each of c. bifermentans, c. clostridiiforme, c. limosum and c. paraputrificum. most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. these were  immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). the clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. the species most  commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); bacteroides spp. (b. fragilis group) (50), escherichia coli (22), pigmented prevotella or porphyromonas spp. (18) and fusobacterium spp. (10). most bacteroides and escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck  sites. antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). only two patients died. these data illustrate the  importance of clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.

TI  == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  == bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are predominant anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are common pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses and orofacial infections. clostridium perfringens can cause bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause diarrhea or antibiotic-associated colitis.

TI  == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. anaerobes can be  isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. the genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) offteroides, clostridium, gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, actinomyces, and bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (veillonella and acidaminococcus). clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.
