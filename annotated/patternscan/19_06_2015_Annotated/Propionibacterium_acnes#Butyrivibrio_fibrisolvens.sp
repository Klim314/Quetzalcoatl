TI  == interactions between oil substrates and glucose on pure cultures of ruminal lipase-producing bacteria.
AB  == the hydrolysis of free fatty acids from lipids is a prerequisite for biohydrogenation, a process that effectively saturates free fatty acids. anaerovibrio lipolyticus 5s and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens have long been thought  to be the major contributors to ruminal lipolysis; however, propionibacterium avidum and acnes recently have been identified as contributing lipase activity in the rumen. in order to further characterize the lipase activity of these bacterial populations, each was grown with three different lipid substrates, olive oil, corn oil, and flaxseed oil (3 %). because different finishing rations  contain varying levels of glycogen (a source of free glucose) this study also documented the effects of glucose on lipolysis. p. avidum and a. lipolyticus 5s demonstrated the most rapid rates (p < 0.05) of lipolysis for cultures grown with olive oil and flaxseed oil, respectively. a. lipolyticus, b. fibrisolvens, and p. avidum more effectively hydrolyzed flaxseed oil than olive oil or corn oil, especially in the presence of 0.02 % glucose. conversely, p. acnes hydrolyzed corn oil more readily than olive oil or flaxseed oil and glucose had no effect on lipolytic rate. thus, these bacterial species demonstrated different specificities for oil substrates and different sensitivities to glucose.

TI  == glycerol inhibition of ruminal lipolysis in vitro.
AB  == supplemental glycerol inhibits rumen lipolysis, a prerequisite for rumen biohydrogenation, which is responsible for the saturation of dietary fatty acids  consumed by ruminant animals. feeding excess glycerol, however, adversely affects dry matter digestibility. to more clearly define the effect of supplemental glycerol on rumen lipolysis, mixed populations of ruminal bacteria were incubated with 6 or 20% glycerol (vol/vol). after 48-h anaerobic incubation of mixed culture rumen fluid, rates of free fatty acid production (nmol/ml per h) for the  6 and 20% glycerol-supplemented samples were decreased by 80 and 86%, respectively, compared with rates from nonsupplemented control cultures (12.4+/-1.0; mean +/- se). conversely, assay of the prominent ruminal lipase-producing bacteria anaerovibrio lipolyticus 5s, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens  49, and propionibacterium species avidum and acnes revealed no effect of 2 or 10% (vol/vol) added glycerol on lipolytic activity by these organisms. supplementing  glycerol at 6% on a vol/vol basis, equivalent to supplementing glycerol at approximately 8 to 15% of diet dry matter, effectively reduced lipolysis. however, the mechanism of glycerol inhibition of ruminal lipolysis remains to be  demonstrated.

TI  == ricinoleic acid inhibits methanogenesis and fatty acid biohydrogenation in ruminal digesta from sheep and in bacterial cultures.
AB  == ricinoleic acid (ra; 12-hydroxy-cis-9-18:1) is the main fatty acid component of castor oil. although a precursor for cla synthesis in lactic acid bacteria, ra was found previously not to form cla in ruminal digesta but to have some inhibitory properties. the present study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of ra to modulate ruminal biohydrogenation and methanogenesis. ruminal digesta from 4 sheep receiving a mixed hay-concentrate diet was incubated in vitro with 0.167 g/l of linoleic acid (la; cis-9,cis-12-18:2) or with a combination of la and ra or la and castor oil (la, ra, and castor oil added to a final concentration of 0.167 g/l) in the presence and absence of lipase. the cla rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-18:2) accumulated when either ra or castor oil and lipase was present. vaccenic acid (va; trans-11-18:1) also accumulated, and a decrease of the rate of production of stearic acid (sa; 18:0) was observed. when  la was incubated with castor oil in the absence of lipase, no effects on biohydrogenation were observed. ricinoleic acid at 0.02 g/l did not affect growth of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens but it inhibited growth of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus. butyrivibrio proteoclasticus but not b. fibrisolvens metabolized ra to 12-hydroxystearate. linoleic acid metabolism by b. proteoclasticus appeared to be unaffected by ra addition whereas rumenic acid accumulation increased (p =  0.015 at 12 h) when ra was added. a 28% decrease (p = 0.004) in methane was obtained in 24 h in vitro incubations of diluted buffered ruminal fluid with added 0.2 g ra/l. there was no effect on the total concentration of vfa after 24  h as a result of ra addition, but the molar proportions of acetate and butyrate were decreased (p = 0.041 and p < 0.001, respectively) whereas that of propionate increased (p < 0.001). it was concluded that, at least in vitro, ra or the combination of castor oil and lipase inhibit biohydrogenation, causing the accumulation of rumenic acid and va, with potential health benefits for ruminant  products. the effect appeared to be mediated via an inhibitory effect on the biohydrogenating activity of b. proteoclasticus. an added environmental benefit could be a concomitant decrease in methane emissions. in vivo studies are now required to confirm the potential of these additives.

TI  == metabolism of conjugated linoleic acids and 18 : 1 fatty acids by ruminal bacteria: products and mechanisms.
AB  == cultures of ruminal bacteria known to metabolize unsaturated fatty acids were grown in medium containing 50 microg ml(-1) of geometric and positional isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) or 18 : 1 fatty acids and 37.4 % deuterium oxide to investigate the mechanisms responsible for fatty acid metabolism. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens jw11 converted cis-9,trans-11-18 : 2 and trans-9,trans-11-18 : 2 to trans-11-18 : 1 as the main product, labelled at c-9,  and metabolized trans-10,cis-12-18 : 2 to trans-10-18 : 1, labelled at c-13, and  smaller amounts of trans-12-18 : 1 and cis-12-18 : 1. butyrivibrio proteoclasticus p-18 did not grow in the presence of cis-9,trans-11-18 : 2 or trans-10,cis-12-18 : 2, but grew in medium containing trans-9,trans-11-18 : 2, forming 18 : 0. propionibacterium acnes, a ruminal species that isomerizes linoleic acid to trans-10,cis-12-18 : 2, did not metabolize cla isomers further.  b. fibrisolvens metabolized small amounts of trans-10-18 : 1, trans-11-18 : 1 and cis-9-18 : 1, but the products formed were not detected. b. proteoclasticus, on the other hand, carried out substantial conversion of 18 : 1 substrates to 18 : 0. p. acnes hydrated cis-9-18 : 1 and trans-11-18 : 1 to 10-oh-18 : 0, which was  further oxidized to yield 10-o-18 : 0. the deuterium enrichment in the intermediates formed during incubations with 9,11 geometric isomers of cla was about half that of the products from trans-10,cis-12 cla and 18 : 1 isomers, suggesting that the reduction of 9,11 geometric isomers cla by ruminal bacteria occurs via different mechanisms compared with the metabolism of other unsaturated fatty acids.

TI  == biochemistry of pufa double bond isomerases producing conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the biotransformation of linoleic acid (la) into conjugated linoleic acid (cla) by microorganisms is a potentially useful industrial process. in most cases, however, the identities of proteins involved and the details of enzymatic activity regulation are far from clear. here we summarize available data on the reaction mechanisms of cla-producing enzymes characterized until now, from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, lactobacillus acidophilus, ptilota filicina, and propionibacterium acnes. a general feature of enzymatic la isomerization is the protein-assisted abstraction of an aliphatic hydrogen atom from position c-11, while the role of flavin as cofactor for the double bond activation in cla-producing enzymes is also discussed with regard to the recently published three-dimensional structure of an isomerase from p. acnes. combined data from structural studies, isotopic labeling experiments, and sequence comparison suggest that at least two different prototypical active site geometries occur among polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa) double bond isomerases.

TI  == isomers of conjugated linoleic acids are synthesized via different mechanisms in  ruminal digesta and bacteria.
AB  == digesta samples from the ovine rumen and pure ruminal bacteria were incubated with linoleic acid (la) in deuterium oxide-containing buffer to investigate the mechanisms of the formation of conjugated linoleic acids (clas). rumenic acid (ra; cis-9,trans-11-18:2), trans-9,trans-11-18:2, and trans-10,cis-12-18:2 were the major cla intermediates formed from la in ruminal digesta, with traces of trans-9,cis-11-18:2, cis-9,cis-11-18:2, and cis-10,cis-12-18:2. mass spectrometry indicated an increase in the n+1 isotopomers of ra and other 9,11-cla isomers, as a result of labeling at c-13, whereas 10,12 isomers contained minimal enrichment. in pure culture, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and clostridium proteoclasticum produced mostly ra with minor amounts of other 9,11 isomers, all labeled at c-13. increasing the deuterium enrichment in water led to an isotope effect, whereby (1)h was incorporated in preference to (2)h. in contrast, the type strain and a ruminal isolate of propionibacterium acnes produced trans-10,cis-12-18:2 and other 10,12 isomers that were minimally labeled. incubations with ruminal digesta provided no support for ricinoleic acid (12-oh,cis-9-18:1) as an intermediate of  ra synthesis. we conclude that geometric isomers of 10,12-cla are synthesized by  a mechanism that differs from the synthesis of 9,11 isomers, the latter possibly  initiated by hydrogen abstraction on c-11 catalyzed by a radical intermediate enzyme.

TI  == mechanism of gram variability in select bacteria.
AB  == gram stains were performed on strains of actinomyces bovis, actinomyces viscosus, arthrobacter globiformis, bacillus brevis, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, clostridium tetani, clostridium thermosaccharolyticum, corynebacterium parvum, mycobacterium  phlei, and propionibacterium acnes, using a modified gram regimen that allowed the staining process to be observed by electron microscopy (j. a. davies, g. k. anderson, t. j. beveridge, and h. c. clark, j. bacteriol. 156:837-845, 1983). furthermore, since a platinum salt replaced the iodine mordant of the gram stain, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy could evaluate the stain intensity and location by monitoring the platinum signal. these gram-variable bacteria could be split into two groups on the basis of their staining responses. in the actinomyces-arthrobacter-corynebacterium-mycobacterium-propionibacterium group, few cells became gram negative until the exponential growth phase; by mid-exponential phase, 10 to 30% of the cells were gram negative. the cells that  became gram negative were a select population of the culture, had initiated septum formation, and were more fragile to the stress of the gram stain at the division site. as cultures aged to stationary phase, there was a relatively slight increase toward gram negativity (now 15 to 40%) due to the increased lysis of nondividing cells by means of lesions in the side walls; these cells maintained their rod shape but stained gram negative. those in the bacillus-butyrivibrio-clostridium group also became gram negative as cultures aged but by a separate set of events. these bacteria possessed more complex walls, since they were covered by an s layer. they stained gram positive during lag and the initial exponential growth phases, but as doubling times increased, the wall fabric underlying the s layer became noticeably thinner and diffuse, and the cells became more fragile to the gram stain. by stationary phase, these cultures were virtually gram negative.

TI  == effect of ph on growth rates of rumen amylolytic and lactilytic bacteria.
AB  == the relationship between the ph of the medium and specific growth rates, in well-buffered media at 38.5 degrees c, was determined for three strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and for one strain each of streptococcus bovis, selenomonas ruminantium subsp. lactilytica. megasphaera elsdenii, veillonella alcalescens, and propionibacterium acnes. the ph optima for growth were between 6.1 and 6.6 for all six species, and the upper ph limits were between 7.3 and 7.8. the lower limit ph values for growth on glucose were 5.4 for b. fibrisolvens, near 5.0 for v. alcalescens, and between 4.4 and 4.8 for the other  four species. these values fall within the minimum ph ranges found when these species are grown in poorly buffered medium with nonlimiting glucose concentrations. acid sensitivity per se could cause the washout of b. fibrisolvens, but not of the other five species, from the rumens of animals on high-starch diets.
