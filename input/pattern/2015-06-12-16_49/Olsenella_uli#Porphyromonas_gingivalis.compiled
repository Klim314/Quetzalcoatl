TI  - Microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis.
AB  - AIM: To characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. METHODOLOGY: Apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the Kyushu University Hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. DNA was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and specific fimA genotypes of Porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis with specific primers. RESULTS: Bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were P. gingivalis (19.9%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and Propionibacterium acnes (9%). Bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. In addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., Peptostreptococcaceae sp. HOT-113, Olsenella uli, Slackia exigua, Selemonas infelix, P. gingivalis with type IV fimA, and a combination of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcaceae sp. HOT-113 and predominance of Streptococcus spp. On the other hand, neither Enterococcus faecalis nor C. albicans were detected in any of the samples. CONCLUSION: Whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. The diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from HIV- and HIV+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 HIV- and 20 HIV+ subjects. Pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Then, checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. The percentage of DNA probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. Significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the Mann-Whitney test and the Chi-square analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The most prevalent taxa detected were Dialister pneumosintes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sobrinus, Corynebacterium diphteriae, and Helicobacter pylori among HIV- subjects and D. pneumosintes, Prevotella tannerae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella nigrescens, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae among HIV+ individuals. D. pneumosintes, C. diphtheria, and C. albicans were the most abundant species in the HIV- group, whereas the predominant taxa in HIV+ samples were P. tannerae, D. pneumosintes and Olsenella uli. P. tannerae, O. uli, Veilonella dispar, Bacteroides fragilis, and Actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in HIV+ samples. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between HIV- and HIV+ individuals. The root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in HIV+ individuals.
