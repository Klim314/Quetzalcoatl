TI  == comparison of bacterial culture and 16s rrna community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB  == culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. a consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16s rrna genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects  with active caries. samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. a diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera prevotella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, and streptococcus. the five most abundant species were: lactobacillus gasseri, prevotella denticola, alloprevotella tannerae, s. mutans and streptococcus sp. hot 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of prevotella species. the different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387r was used. all of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of actinobacteria compared to culture. pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than  the clonal analysis. pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of actinobacteria compared to culture.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.
