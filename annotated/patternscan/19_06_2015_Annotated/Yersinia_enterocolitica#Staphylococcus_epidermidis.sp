TI  == antimicrobial efficacy and phytochemical analysis of indigofera trita linn.
AB  == an in vitro antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of various extracts of indigofera trita l. viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts were carried out. a total of 21 microorganisms (19 bacteria and  2 fungal strains) were used for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion method and a standard procedure was used to identify the phytochemical constituents. petroleum ether extract showed moderate inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus (14.40 mm), s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), salmonella paratyphi a (12.80 mm), streptococcus mutans (12.20 mm), escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, s. typhi and burkholderia cepacia (12.00 mm). the chloroform extract also showed antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), s. typhimurium (12.60 mm), s. paratyphi a, s. brunei and yersinia enterocolitica (12.00 mm). the acetone extract of i. trita showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. epidermidis (18.20 mm), s. typhimurium (14.60 mm), s. infantis (13.80 mm), s. aureus (13.40 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.00 mm) and enterobacter aerogenes (12.00 mm) were documented. ethanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (18.60 mm), s. paratyphi a (14.60 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.40 mm), s. typhi (12.40 mm), s. aureus, e. aerogenes, s. typhimurium and s. infantis (12.00 mm). aqueous extract  of i. trita considerably inhibited s. epidermidis (13.80 mm), s. paratyphi a and  y. enterocolitica (12.20 mm), e. aerogenes and haemophilus parahaemolyticus (12.00 mm). all the five extracts showed a minimal antifungal activity when compared to antibacterial activity. the result revealed that the antimicrobial properties of i. trita might be associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols and alkaloids.

TI  == bacterial growth in red blood cell units exposed to uncontrolled temperatures: challenging the 30-minute rule.
AB  == background and objectives: the '30-min rule' requires discarding red blood cells  (rbcs) exposed to uncontrolled temperatures for >30 min to ensure safe rbc transfusion. this study was aimed at determining whether multiple room temperature (rt) exposures promote bacterial growth. materials and methods: pooled and split rbc units were inoculated with ~1 cfu/ml of serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli or staphylococcus epidermidis. control  units remained in storage, while test units were exposed to rt for six 30-min or  three 60-min intervals. bacterial concentrations and endotoxin levels were determined after each exposure and at 42 days of storage. rbc core temperature and rt were monitored in mock units with escort ilog temperature loggers. a mixed model was used for statistical analyses. results: red blood cell core temperature reached 10.7 +/- 0.4 degrees c and 14.2 +/- 0.2 degrees c during 30- and 60-min exposures, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and e. coli did not grow in either control or exposed rbcs. yersinia enterocolitica concentration and endotoxin levels were similar in both control and test units. serratia marcescens concentration and endotoxin levels were higher in exposed units; however, differences between units exposed for 30 min or 60 min were not observed. conclusion: there is no added risk to rbc safety by increasing rt exposures to 60 min with each removal from storage for up to a total of 3 h during rbc shelf life. therefore, extending the 30-min limitation in rbcs exposed to uncontrolled  temperatures to 60 min should be considered by regulatory agencies.

TI  == treatment of whole blood (wb) and red blood cells (rbc) with s-303 inactivates pathogens and retains in vitro quality of stored rbc.
AB  == a pathogen inactivation (pi) process has been developed using the frangible anchor linker effector (frale) compound s-303. a series of experiments were performed in whole blood (wb) to measure the level of viral and bacterial inactivation. the results showed that 0.2mm s-303 and 2mm glutathione (gsh) inactivated >6.5 logs of hiv, >5.7 logs of bluetongue virus, >7.0 logs of yersinia enterocolitica, 4.2 logs of serratia marcescens, and 7.5 logs of staphylococcus epidermidis. recent development for s-303 is focused on optimization of the pi process for red blood cell concentrates (rbc). a series of studies in rbc showed that 0.2mm s-303 and 20mm gsh inactivated approximately 5 logs or greater of y. enterocolitica, e. coli, s. marcescens, s. aureus, hiv, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bluetongue virus and human adenovirus 5. in both applications of the s-303 process, in vitro parameters of rbc function and physiology were retained compared to conventional rbc. results from these studies indicate that s-303 can be applicable for pi of rbc and wb.

TI  == bactericidal effect of solar water disinfection under real sunlight conditions.
AB  == batch solar disinfection (sodis) inactivation kinetics are reported for suspensions in water of campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, and endospores of  bacillus subtilis, exposed to strong natural sunlight in spain and bolivia. the exposure time required for complete inactivation (at least 4-log-unit reduction and below the limit of detection, 17 cfu/ml) under conditions of strong natural sunlight (maximum global irradiance, approximately 1,050 w m(-2) +/- 10 w m(-2))  was as follows: c. jejuni, 20 min; s. epidermidis, 45 min; enteropathogenic e. coli, 90 min; y. enterocolitica, 150 min. following incomplete inactivation of b. subtilis endospores after the first day, reexposure of these samples on the following day found that 4% (standard error, 3%) of the endospores remained viable after a cumulative exposure time of 16 h of strong natural sunlight. sodis is shown to be effective against the vegetative cells of a number of emerging waterborne pathogens; however, bacterial species which are spore forming may survive this intervention process.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

TI  == extracellular accumulation of bioactive substances; interleukin-1beta (il-1beta)  and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) in stored blood units and relation  to bacterial contamination.
AB  == bacterial contamination of blood and its cellular components remains an unresolved problem in transfusion medicine and is considered to be the most common microbiological cause of transfusion associated morbidity and mortality. the present work was designed to explore the levels of two bioactive compounds interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) in stored blood units and their relation to bacterial contamination of these units.  this study was conducted on 112 blood units obtained from blood bank of mansoura  university children hospital. sequential blood samples were obtained both immediately at donation and after 10 days for measurement of il-1beta and pai-1 and for bacterial culture by bactec 9050 system. there was statistically significant increase in both il-1 beta and pai-1 (p = 0.0001) after 10 days of blood units storage. bacteriological culture revealed no growth in 68% and positive growth in 32% of blood units. the commonest isolated organism was staphylococcus aureus (15%) followed by staphylococcus epidermedis (13%) then yersinia sp. and enterobacter sp. (2%) for each. from the present study we could  conclude that stored blood units contain platelets and wbcs derived bioactive substances pai-1 and il-1beta which increase with the duration of blood storage.  furthermore, the extended duration of storage carries the danger of blood contamination by bacteria. automated blood culture system seems to be helpful in  identification of bacterial contamination of blood units. we recommend fresh blood transfusion as early as possible and the practice of leucofiltration to avoid blood transfusion complications.

TI  == photochemical treatment of plasma with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates pathogens while retaining coagulation function.
AB  == background: the intercept blood system, a photochemical treatment (pct) process,  has been developed to inactivate pathogens in platelet concentrates. these studies evaluated the efficacy of pct to inactivate pathogens in plasma and the effect of pct on plasma function. study design and methods: jumbo (600 ml) plasma units were inoculated with high titers of test pathogens and treated with 150 micromol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) long-wavelength ultraviolet light. the viability of each pathogen before and after treatment was measured with biological assays. plasma function was evaluated through measurement of coagulation factors and antithrombotic protein activities. results: the levels of inactivation expressed as log-reduction were as follows: cell-free human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1), greater than 6.8; cell-associated hiv-1, greater than 6.4; human t-lymphotropic virus-i (htlv-i), 4.5; htlv-ii, greater than 5.7; hepatitis b virus (hbv) and hepatitis c virus, greater than 4.5; duck hbv, 4.4 to 4.5; bovine viral diarrhea virus, 6.0; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 5.5; west nile virus, 6.8; bluetongue virus, 5.1; human adenovirus 5, 6.8; klebsiella pneumoniae, greater than 7.4; staphylococcus epidermidis and yersinia enterocolitica, greater than 7.3; treponema pallidum, greater than 5.9; borrelia burgdorferi, greater than 10.6; plasmodium falciparum, 6.9; trypanosoma cruzi, greater than 5.0; and babesia microti, greater than 5.3.  retention of coagulation factor activity after pct was expressed as the proportion of pretreatment (baseline) activity. retention was 72 to 73 percent of baseline fibrinogen and factor (f)viii activity and 78 to 98 percent for fii, fv, fvii, f ix, fx, fxi, fxiii, protein c, protein s, antithrombin, and alpha2-antiplasmin. conclusion: pct of plasma inactivated high levels of a wide range of pathogens while maintaining adequate coagulation function. pct has the potential to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases in patients requiring plasma transfusion support.

TI  == antimicrobial and toxicological profile of the new biocide akacid plus.
AB  == objectives: akacid plus is a new member of the polymeric guanidine family of disinfectants. it was especially developed to enhance the antimicrobial activity  of this class with significantly less toxicity. the in vitro activity of akacid plus compared with chlorhexidine digluconate and mupirocin was tested against a total of 369 recent clinical isolates. methods: the organisms tested by clsi reference methods included the following: staphylococcus aureus (98), staphylococcus epidermidis (9), bacillus spp. (2), enterococcus faecalis (32), klebsiella spp. (45), enterobacter spp. (20), escherichia coli (65), salmonella spp. (6), shigella spp. (2), yersinia enterocolitica (1), acinetobacter spp. (4), proteus spp. (7), pseudomonas aeruginosa (59), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4),  candida spp. (10) and aspergillus spp. (7). in vitro selection of resistance to akacid plus was carried out on 24 strains. toxicological analyses were also performed. results: all tested agents were more effective against staphylococcus  spp. and bacillus spp. than against e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria. the mic90s of chlorhexidine and mupirocin showed a 4-fold and 32-fold increase for methicillin-resistant s. aureus in comparison with methicillin-susceptible strains, while mic values of akacid plus were similar for antibiotic-susceptible  and multiresistant strains. bactericidal action of akacid plus was observed at 1-2x mic. the in vitro selection of resistance test showed no increase in mic values of akacid plus for any isolate after 30 passages. in addition, akacid plus showed low oral and dermal toxicity. conclusions: these preliminary results demonstrate the broad antimicrobial properties of akacid plus, which makes it a promising tool for topical application in the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == influence of blood prestorage conditions and white blood cell filtration on the bacterial load of blood deliberately inoculated with gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == background and objectives: currently, the bacterial contamination of blood constitutes one of the major infectious risks of transfusion. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bactericidal effect of blood on various bacterial species and to determine the influence of prestorage conditions and white blood cell (wbc) filtration on the reduction of the bacterial load in isolated red blood cells (rbcs). materials and methods: the growth kinetics of eight different species of bacteria were studied at 20 degrees c in deliberately contaminated rbc units. further experiments evaluated the effect of prestorage conditions and wbc  filtration on the viability of two model bacteria (klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus epidermidis) in comparison to previous results obtained with yersinia enterocolitica. results: for bacteria susceptible to the bactericidal effect of blood (mainly gram-negative rods), a reduction of the bacterial load was obtained within 2 h of prestorage at 20 degrees c. when the prestorage period was prolonged beyond 3 h at 20 degrees c, rapid growth was observed with some enterobacteriaceae. whereas wbc filtration reduced dramatically the viability of  y. enterocolitica, it had only a minimal effect on the viability of s. epidermidis and k. oxytoca. however, the two latter species of bacteria did not survive prolonged storage at 4 degrees c. conclusions: experiments conducted under realistic conditions are needed to determine whether it would be worthwhile recommending the rapid storage of rbcs at 4 degrees c after wbc reduction of the  blood product.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == antiplasmid effect of promethazine in mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  == promethazine has been recognised as an effective antiplasmid agent in cultures containing a single bacterial species such as escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus and agrobacterium tumefaciens. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of heterogenity of the microbial flora on plasmid elimination by promethazine in a laboratory based model system of mixed bacterial infection. f'lac plasmid elimination of e. coli k12 le140 was studied in the presence of a numerically predominant gram-positive  species (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis) by promethazine (0-120 mg/l) at 23, 37 and 39 degrees c. growth kinetics of different bacterial species  were studied at various temperatures without drug treatment in mixed bacterial cultures and it was found that the small number of added bacteria overgrew the pre-existing flora during the incubation period. we observed that bacterial-bacterial interactions modified the growth rate of individual bacterial species and gave selective advantages to some bacterial species of the microbial  community. some interactions between coexisting bacterial species enhanced the frequency of plasmid curing by promethazine in mixed cultures with s. epidermidis. in our experiments the plasmid curing action of promethazine was more effective at elevated temperature than at lower temperatures.

TI  == comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  == background: the relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. methods: we measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. results: our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b)  clostridium perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and  escherichia coli o157:h7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) listeria monocytogenes, shigella sonnei, and vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, bacillus cereus, and yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. conclusion: we found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.

TI  == use of leukodepletion filters for the removal of bacteria.
AB  == recipient exposure to allogeneic donor leukocytes can mediate a number of immunologic complications of transfusion or can transmit leukotropic viruses carried by the donor. leukocyte depletion of cellular blood components has been shown to reduce the incidence of such complications. in recent years, prestorage  leukocyte depletion by filtration has also been suggested as a means of decreasing the incidence of bacterial overgrowth in cellular blood components. this review analyzes published studies on the use of leukodepletion filters for removal of staphylococcus epidermidis and yersinia enterocolitica from blood. although ineffective for removal of s. epidermidis from platelet concentrates, inoculation studies demonstrate removal of low levels of y. enterocolitica from red cell concentrates. based on these studies, four possible mechanism(s) for removal of bacteria by leukodepletion filters are analyzed: phagocytosis by leukocytes during a prefiltration holding period; complement-mediated bacterial killing enhanced by filtration; adherence of bacteria to leukocyte surfaces retained within the filter; and direct removal of bacteria by the filter media. just as multiple mechanisms appear to account for the efficiency with which these filters deplete blood of leukocytes, it is likely that more than one mechanism accounts for the experimental observation that leukocyte depletion filters can reduce overgrowth of y. enterocolitica in stored red cell concentrates.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

TI  == the use of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial ribosomal rna gene probe and blood gas analysis for the rapid detection of bacterial contamination in white cell-reduced and nonreduced platelets.
AB  == because of the rising incidence of bacterial growth and septic platelet transfusions in aging units, platelet storage is currently limited in the united  states to 5 days. this approved shelf life of platelets might be altered if methods were devised to rapidly detect infected units and/or to decrease the incidence of bacterially contaminated platelets. an investigation was conducted on the effect of a prototype blood collection system with an in-line filter for the production of white cell-reduced platelet-rich plasma on the growth of bacteria in platelets prepared from whole blood that had been inoculated with staphylococcus epidermidis. additional studies were conducted with a chemiluminescence-linked ribosomal rna (rrna) gene probe and with blood gas analysis to identify possible methods for the rapid detection of bacterial contamination. all units were followed for 9 days of storage. the filtration of the platelet-rich plasma resulted in an approximate 2 log10 reduction in white cells with an average loss of 6.7 percent of platelets. filtration did not appear to alter bacterial growth. in all platelet units that supported growth, po2 dropped to negligible values and pco2 rose relative to culture-negative units. the changes were most sensitive and specific beyond 5 days of storage. the universal bacterial rrna probe assay was able to detect s. epidermidis in concentrations as low as 1 x 10(3) colony-forming units per ml in some cases and  reliably detected all units contaminated at a concentration of 1 x 10(4) colony-forming units per ml.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin  and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.

TI  == mhc-unrestricted recognition of bacteria-infected target cells by human cd8+ cytotoxic t lymphocytes.
AB  == a cd8+ alpha beta tcr+ t cell clone (a35) was isolated from the synovial fluid of a patient with post-enteric reactive arthritis caused by yersinia enterocolitica. this clone efficiently killed autologous and allogeneic target cells that had been preincubated with live but not with heat-killed bacteria. there was no restriction by polymorphic parts of hla-a, -b, or -c molecules and a hla class ii-deficient mutant cell line was lysed as efficiently as its normal counterpart, whereas infected hla class i-deficient cells (daudi cells) were not. the clone showed crossreaction between yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes, but did not lyse target cells preincubated with staphylococcus epidermidis. mab to cd2, cd3, and cd8 efficiently blocked a35, whereas the addition of mab to hla class ii or to hla class i did not. this clone apparently represents a novel effector mechanism against bacteria-infected or -modified cells that could be involved in the immunopathology of reactive arthritis.

TI  == rapid methods for differentiating gram-positive from gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == different tests based on lysis by koh and on reaction with fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates, l-alanine-4-nitroanilide (lana); l-alanine-4-methoxy- beta-naphthylamide (mna); 4-alanine-2-amidoacridone (aaa); l-alanine-7-amido- 4-methylcoumarin (aamc); 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulphonic acid (ans) were compared for their suitability to distinguish gram-positive from gram-negative bacteria. a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml was chosen for incorporating lana, aaa, aamc and ans into the growth medium, based on sensitivity tests. mna did not show any detectable reaction over a concentration range from 50 to 200 micrograms/ml, and led to inhibition of all bacteria at 200 micrograms/ml. in the examination of a total of 146 bacterial strains, including yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, and b. subtilis the koh test was not comparable  with the gram staining. a good correlation with gram staining was found between lana, aaa and aamc added to plate count agar on one hand, and lana and aamc impregnated paper strips on the other hand, thereby utilizing the aminopeptidase  activity. agar containing ans showed detectable fluorescence with all gram-negative strains, but with staphylococcus aureus and staph. epidermidis a weak reaction was also observed. aamc was selected for a rapid paper strip test.  with this substrate a pronounced blue fluorescence was obtained with gram-negative colonies.

TI  == effects of room-temperature exposure on bacterial growth in stored red cells.
AB  == experiments were performed to determine the effect of room-temperature (rt) exposure on the growth rates of selected bacteria by deliberate contamination of  as-1 packed red cell (rbc) units contained in pl146 plastic bags. isolates of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, and yersinia enterocolitica were inoculated into 3- to 5-day-old packed rbc units. the units were refrigerated at 4 to 6 degrees c for 14 days. on two occasions during this period, one-half of the units were removed from the refrigerator and held at 25 to 26 degrees c for 2 hours. timed samples taken during the periods at rt revealed stable or decreasing bacterial counts in the majority of exposed units,  and in no instance was a marked increase in bacterial growth observed. samples taken after subsequent prolonged rerefrigeration showed no significant increase in bacterial counts as compared with those in control units that were refrigerated constantly. these results indicate that rt exposure of contaminated  rbc units does not result in accelerated bacterial proliferation over a period of 2 hours and that it may, in fact, have a detrimental effect on bacterial growth.

TI  == [antibacterial and bactericidal activities of japanese green tea].
AB  == we found that extracts of japanese green tea leaves inhibited the growth of various bacteria causing diarrheal diseases. all tea samples tested showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, vibrio cholerae o1, v. cholerae non o1. v. parahaemolyticus, v. mimicus, campylobacter jejuni and plesiomonas shigelloides. none of the tea samples had any effect on the growth of v. fluvialis, aeromonas sobria, a. hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, enteroinvasive escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, enterobacter cloacae or yersinia enterocolitica. salmonella and shigella showed susceptibilities different depending on the kind of japanese green tea. japanese  green tea showed also bactericidal activity over s. aureus, v. parahaemolyticus and even enteropathogenic e. coli which was not sensitive when tested by cup method. the bactericidal activity was shown even at the drinking concentration in daily life.

TI  == the effect of synthetic iron chelators on bacterial growth in human serum.
AB  == the effect of synthetic iron chelators of the 1-alkyl-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyrid-4-one class (the l1 series) and 1-hydroxypyrid-2-one (l4) on bacterial growth in human serum was compared with those of the plant iron chelators mimosine and maltol and of the microbial siderophore desferrioxamine. none of the synthetic chelators enhanced growth of 3 gram-negative organisms (yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa); in some cases they were even inhibitory. l4 strongly stimulated growth of staphylococcus epidermidis, but the l1 series had only a marginal effect. maltol was mildly inhibitory to all 4 bacterial species, while mimosine enhanced the growth of s. epidermidis and y. enterocolitica but had little effect on e. coli or p. aeruginosa. desferrioxamine enhanced the growth of all except e. coli. these results suggest that the chelators of synthetic or plant origin may carry less risk of increasing susceptibility to bacterial infection in patients undergoing chelation therapy for iron overload than does desferrioxamine, the drug currently in clinical use.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of a-56268 (te-031) against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and chlamydia trachomatis.
AB  == the in vitro activity of a-56268 (te-031) was determined and compared with that of 13 antibiotics against 401 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and 11 strains of chlamydia trachomatis. a-56268 was very active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and neisseria gonorrhoeae, and was  among the most active of the agents tested against listeria monocytogenes, streptococci and chlamydia trachomatis. it was moderately active against haemophilus spp., vibrio spp., campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus. it was inactive against enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. a-56268 was not consistently bactericidal or more active than erythromycin for any organism except chlamydia trachomatis.
