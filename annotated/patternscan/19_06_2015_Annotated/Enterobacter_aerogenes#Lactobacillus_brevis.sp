TI  == study of the micro-organisms associated with the fermented bread (khamir) produced from sorghum in gizan region, saudi arabia.
AB  == traditional bread (khamir) was made from sorghum flour of two local varieties, bayadh and hamra. the bread was prepared by mixing the sorghum flour with water and spices (onion, garlic, lemon juice and fenugreek) in a 1:0.8 (w/w) ratio and  fermented for 24 h at 30 degrees c. two other fermentations were carried out using an inoculum from the previous fermentation. the micro-organisms were isolated from different plates and identified using different characterization systems. both total bacterial populations and lactic acid bacteria increased with fermentation time and reached the highest number at 16 h (first fermentation) and at 8 h (second and third fermentation). the content of lactic acid was increased  with time to reach 1.2%, but the increase was higher for the second and third fermentations (1.6% each). the ph dropped with time from 6.77 to 4.35 in the first fermentation and from 6.65 to 4.18, and 6.57-3.93, in the second and third  fermentations, respectively. the microorganisms, which were isolated and characterized during the 24 h fermentation, included: bacteria (pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus brevis, lact. lactis subsp. lactis, lact. cellobiosus, klebsiella oxytoca, kl. pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, ent. sakazakii, serratia marcescens and ser. odourifera), moulds (penicillium sp., rhizopus sp.,  aspergillus niger, alternaria sp., fusarium sp. and mucor sp.) and yeasts (candida parapsilosis, c. orvegnsis and rhodotorula glutinis).

TI  == microbiology of controlled rotting of egusi (colocynthis citrullus l.) fruits for the harvesting of the seeds.
AB  == microorganisms isolated from naturally rotting egusi fruits which are used as a source of dietary seeds, were mainly bacteria: bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, b. polymyxa, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, lactobacillus plantarum, la. brevis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, micrococcus and candida spp. the rotting period of egusi fruits could be decreased from 120 to 72 h by using a mixture of b. subtilis and b. licheniformis.

TI  == distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  == the gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. a colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides vulgatus, enterobacter aerogenes, and a fusobacterium sp. was established. these gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. except for the presence of large numbers of bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of s. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism  in conventional gerbils. microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic  gerbils were similar. histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == biosynthesis of diacetyl in bacteria and yeast.
AB  == both diacetyl and acetoin were produced by cell-free extracts and cultures of pseudomonas fluorescens, aerobacter aerogenes, lactobacillus brevis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae 299, whereas only acetoin was produced by cell-free extracts and cultures of streptococcus lactis, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, and s. cerevisiae strains 513 and 522. cell-free extracts that produced diacetyl did not produce it from acetoin; they produced it from pyruvate, but only if acetyl-coenzyme a was was added to the reaction mixtures. production of diacetyl by s. cerevisiae 299 was prevented by valine, inhibited by sodium arsenite, and stimulated by pantothenic acid. valine did not prevent the production of acetoin. e. coli and the three strains of s. cerevisiae did not decarboxylate alpha-acetolactate but did use acetaldehyde in the production of acetoin from pyruvate. the other organisms produced acetoin from pyruvate via alpha-acetolactate.
