TI  == fermentation of 4-aminobutyrate by clostridium aminobutyricum: cloning of two genes involved in the formation and dehydration of 4-hydroxybutyryl-coa.
AB  == clostridium aminobutyricum ferments 4-aminobutyrate via succinic semialdehyde, 4-hydroxybutyrate, 4-hydroxybutyryl-coa and crotonyl-coa to acetate and butyrate. the genes coding for the enzymes that catalyse the interconversion of these intermediates are arranged in the order abfd (4-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydratase),  abft (4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferase), and abfh (nad-dependent 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase). the genes abfd and abft were cloned, sequenced  and expressed as active enzymes in escherichia coli. hence the insertion of the [4fe-4s]clusters and fad into the dehydratase required no additional specific protein from c. aminobutyricum. the amino acid sequences of the dehydratase and the coa-transferase revealed close relationships to proteins deduced from the genomes of clostridium difficile, porphyromonas gingivalis and archaeoglobus fulgidus. in addition the n-terminal part of the dehydratase is related to those  of a family of fad-containing mono-oxygenases from bacteria. the putative assignment in the databank of cat2 (orfz) from clostridium kluyveri as 4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferase, which is thought to be involved in the reductive pathway from succinate to butyrate, was confirmed by sequence comparison with abft (57% identity). furthermore, an acetyl-coa:4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferase activity could be detected in cell-free extracts of c. kluyveri.  in contrast to glutaconate coa-transferase from acidaminococcus fermentans, mutation studies suggested that the glutamate residue of the motive exg, which is conserved in many homologues of abft, does not form a coa-ester during catalysis.
