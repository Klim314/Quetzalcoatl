TI  == frequency of spontaneous resistance to peptide deformylase inhibitor gsk1322322 in haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the continuous emergence of multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria is compromising the successful treatment of serious microbial infections. gsk1322322, a novel peptide deformylase (pdf) inhibitor, shows good in vitro antibacterial activity and has demonstrated safety and efficacy in human proof-of-concept clinical studies. in vitro studies were performed to determine the frequency of resistance (for) to this antimicrobial agent in major pathogens  causing respiratory tract and skin infections. resistance to gsk1322322 occurred  at high frequency through loss-of-function mutations in the formyl-methionyl transferase (fmt) protein in staphylococcus aureus (4/4 strains) and streptococcus pyogenes (4/4 strains), and via missense mutations in streptococcus pneumoniae (6/21 strains), but these mutations are associated with a severe in vitro and/or in vivo fitness cost. the overall for to gsk1322322 was very low in  haemophilus influenzae with only one pdf mutant identified in one of four strains. no target-based mutants were identified from s. pyogenes, and only one or no pdf mutants were isolated in three of the four s. aureus strains studied. in s. pneumoniae, pdf mutants were only isolated from six of 21 strains tested and an additional 10 strains did not yield colonies on gsk1322322-containing plates. most of the pdf mutants characterized from these three organisms (35/37), carried mutations in residues at or in close proximity to one of three highly conserved motifs, which are part of the active site of the pdf protein, with 30 of the 35 mutations occurring at position v71 (s. pneumoniae numbering system).

TI  == nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in japan.
AB  == the japanese three academic societies joint antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. the surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments  of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between january 2011 and  june 2012 were investigated. the collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected  bacteria was measured at the kitasato university research center for infections and antimicrobials. the surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., and fusobacterium spp.). bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. we compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. the age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. we were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant h. influenzae. we suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.

TI  == discrepancy in maldi-tof ms identification of uncommon gram-negative bacteria from lower respiratory secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == introduction: early identification of microbial organisms from respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) is important to guide therapeutic decisions. the objective was to compare the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) relative to the conventional phenotypic method in identifying common bacterial isolates, including nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria, in a cohort of patients with cf. methods: a total of 123 isolates from 50 patients with cf representing 14 bacterial species from respiratory specimens were identified using maldi-tof ms in parallel with conventional phenotypic methods. discrepancies were confirmed by 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing in five  gram-negative isolates. results: the maldi-tof ms managed to identify 122/123 (99.2%) bacterial isolates to the genus level and 118/123 (95.9%) were identified to the species level. the maldi-tof ms results were 100% consistent to the species level with conventional phenotypic identification for isolates of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, achromobacter xylosoxidans, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other uncommon organisms such as chryseobacterium gleum and enterobacter cloacae. the 5/123 (4.6%) isolates misidentified were all gram-negative bacteria. the isolation of e. cloacae and haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus may extend the potentially pathogenic list of organisms isolated from patients with cf. conclusion: although the technique provides an early identification and antimicrobial therapy approach in patients with cf, limitation in the diagnosis of uncommon gram-negative bacteria may exist.

TI  == pathogenic bacterial nasopharyngeal colonization and its impact on respiratory diseases in the first year of life: the patch birth cohort study.
AB  == background: for acute respiratory diseases caused by bacteria, colonization in the respiratory tracts is often the first sign, although nasopharynx is the major source of secretions containing pathogens. to understand the pathogenesis of respiratory tract diseases, it is important to analyze the establishment of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization. methods: infants with nasopharyngeal swabs were examined at the age of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months for the detection of pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the methods used for detection were bacterial culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction. results: from january 2012 to august 2013, a total of 320 neonates were enrolled, and 120 of them completed the first 12-month study. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen at all 5 time points while the rates declined; in contrast,  the other 4 increased during the first year of life. of our series, the multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection rates were higher than those of bacterial culture. more than 50% of staphylococcus aureus was methicillin-resistant, and the trend decreased in the same period. in the analysis of factors associated with the development of infant wheeze, infants with maternal atopy [odds ratio (or): 3.26; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.20-8.88; p = 0.02] and pneumococcal colonization (or: 15.64; 95% ci: 3.25-75.35; p = 0.001) had higher rates of wheeze. conclusions: bacterial interactions may result in differing pathogen prevalence in the first year of life. in addition, nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization may have an effect on the risk of infant wheeze. the result could help clinicians to clarify the relation between bacterial colonization and respiratory illnesses in infancy.

TI  == bacterial and respiratory viral interactions in the etiology of acute otitis media in hiv-infected and hiv-uninfected south african children.
AB  == background: bacteria and respiratory viruses are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute otitis media (aom); however, data from low-middle income countries are sparse. we investigated the etiology of aom in hiv-infected (hiv+), hiv-uninfected (hiv-) and hiv-exposed clinically asymptomatic for hiv-infection (heu) south african children. methods: children >/=3 months to <5 years of age with aom were enrolled between may 2009 and april 2010 (nct01031082). middle ear  fluid samples were cultured for bacteria; antibacterial susceptibility was done and serotyping undertaken for streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed for respiratory viruses using  immunofluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction. results: of 260 aom episodes (hiv+:15; hiv-:182; heu:63), bacteria were found in 54.6%, including haemophilus influenzae (30.8%), 98.8% of which were nontypeable, and streptococcus pneumoniae (20.4%), staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (5.0%) and streptococcus pyogenes (1.5%). nonsusceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin was 64.2%. respiratory viruses were detected in 74.2% of cases. human rhinovirus was most frequently detected (37.7%), followed by adenovirus (14.2%) and human bocavirus (11.5%) overall and irrespective of hiv status. respiratory viruses were identified concurrently with s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis (76.9-78.8%) and staphylococcus aureus (63.4%) cultured from middle ear fluid, as well as in 72.0% of episodes negative for any bacteria. conclusion: the study suggests that respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria play an important role in the development of aom  in children. a similar spectrum of pathogens was observed independently of hiv status. vaccines targeting both nontypeable haemophilus influenzae and s. pneumoniae may have a broad impact on aom in south africa.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the surveillance committee of japanese society of chemotherapy, the japanese association for infectious diseases, and the japanese society for clinical microbiology in 2010: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  == the nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in japan, was conducted by japanese society of chemotherapy, japanese association for infectious diseases and japanese society for clinical microbiology in 2010. the isolates were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections during the period from january and april 2010 by three societies. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by clinical and laboratory standard institutes using maximum 45 antibacterial agents. susceptibility testing was evaluable with 954 strains (206 staphylococcus aureus, 189 streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 streptococcus pyogenes, 182 haemophilus influenzae, 74 moraxella catarrhalis, 139 klebsiella pneumoniae and 160 pseudomonas aeruginosa). ratio of methicillin-resistant s. aureus was as high as  50.5%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were 1.1% and 0.0%, respectively. among h. influenzae, 17.6% of them were found to be  beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (abpc)-intermediately resistant, 33.5% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing abpc-resistant and 11.0% to be beta-lactamase-producing abpc-resistant strains. extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae and multi-drug resistant p. aeruginosa with metallo beta-lactamase were 2.9% and 0.6%, respectively. continuous national surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial  in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update  treatment recommendations on a regular basis.

TI  == development and laboratory evaluation of a real-time pcr assay for detecting viruses and bacteria of relevance for community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia may present with similar clinical symptoms, regardless of viral or bacterial cause. diagnostic assays are needed to rapidly discriminate between causes, because this will guide decisions on appropriate treatment. therefore, a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay with duplex reactions targeting eight bacteria and six viruses was developed. technical performance was examined with linear plasmids. upper and lower respiratory tract  specimens were used to compare the qpcr assay with standard microbiological methods. the limit of detection was 5 to 20 dna template copies with approximately 1000-fold differences in concentrations of the two competing templates. sds for positive controls were <5%. the use of the qpcr assay resulted in 113 positive identifications in 94 respiratory specimens compared with 38 by using standard diagnostics. diagnostic accuracy of the qpcr assay varied between  60% positive agreement with standard tests for streptococcus pneumoniae and 100%  for mycoplasma pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus. negative percentage of agreement was >95% for m. pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza a virus; whereas it was only 56% for haemophilus influenzae. multiple microbial agents were identified in 19 of 44 sputum and 19 of 50 nasopharynx specimens. we conclude that in parallel qpcr detection of the targeted respiratory bacteria and viruses is feasible. the  results indicate good technical performance of the assay in clinical specimens.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) grown in r. macedonia.
AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of monarda punctata essential oil  and its main components against common bacterial pathogens in respiratory tract.
AB  == the aim of the current research work was to study the chemical composition of the essential oil of monarda punctata along with evaluating the essential oil and its major components for their antibacterial effects against some frequently encountered respiratory infection causing pathogens. gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of 13 chemical constituents with thymol (75.2%), p-cymene (6.7%), limonene (5.4), and carvacrol (3.5%) as the major constituents. the oil composition was dominated by the oxygenated monoterpenes. antibacterial activity of the essential oil and its major constituents (thymol, p-cymene, limonene) was evaluated against streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli. the study revealed that  the essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against different strains. among the tested strains, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae were the most susceptible bacterial strain showing lowest mic and mbc values. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was the most resistant bacterial strain to the essential oil treatment showing relatively higher mic and mbc values. scanning electron microscopy revealed that the essential oil induced potent and dose-dependent membrane damage in s. pyogenes and mrsa bacterial strains. the reactive oxygen species generated by the monarda punctata essential  oil were identified using 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (dcfda).this study indicated that the monarda punctata essential oil to a great extent and thymol to a lower extent triggered a substantial increase in the ros levels in s. pyogenes  bacterial cultures which ultimately cause membrane damage as revealed by sem results.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == antibacterial activity and mode of action of the artemisia capillaris essential oil and its constituents against respiratory tract infection-causing pathogens.
AB  == inhalation therapy using essential oils has been used to treat acute and chronic  sinusitis and bronchitis. the aim of the present study was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of artemisia capillaris, and evaluate the antibacterial effects of the essential oil and its main components, against common clinically relevant respiratory bacterial pathogens. gas chromatography and gas chromatographymass spectrometry revealed the presence of 25 chemical constituents, the main constituents being: alphapinene, betapinene, limonene, 1,8cineole, piperitone, betacaryophyllene and capillin. the antibacterial activities of the essential oil, and its major constituents, were evaluated against streptococcus pyogenes, methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), mrsa (clinical strain), methicillingentamicin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mgrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli. the essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against the various strains. the essential oil was observed to be much more potent, as compared with any of its major chemical constituents, exhibiting low minimum inhibitory and bacteriocidal concentration values against all of the bacterial strains. the essential oil was most active against s. pyogenes, mrsa (clinical strain), s. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and e. coli. piperitone and  capillin were the most potent growth inhibitors, among the major chemical constituents. furthermore, the essential oil of a. capillaris induced significant and dosedependent morphological changes in the s. aureus bacterial strain, killing >90% of the bacteria when administered at a higher dose; as determined by scanning electron microscopy. in addition, the essential oil induced a significant leakage of potassium and phosphate ions from the s. aureus bacterial  cultures. these results indicate that the antibacterial action of a. capillaris essential oil may be mediated through the leakage of these two important ions. in conclusion, a. capillaris essential oil exhibits potent antibacterial activity by inducing morphological changes and leakage of ions in s. aureus bacterial cultures.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == bacterial spectrum of spontaneously ruptured otitis media in the era of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in germany.
AB  == otitis media is a common pediatric disease and the main reason for antibiotic prescription in children. before implementation of routine childhood pneumococcal vaccination in germany, serotypes contained in the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv) were among the most frequent pneumococcal serotypes responsible for acute otitis media (aom). this report describes the first 3 years of a prospective, multicenter, epidemiological cross-sectional study examining the bacteriology of middle ear fluids (mef) and nasopharyngeal swabs (nps) of children 2 months to 5 years of age with spontaneously perforated aom in the era  of routine pneumococcal vaccination. mef was obtained from 963 subjects; nps from 877. reported case numbers steeply decreased over the three study years even though the recruiting base remained the same. among subjects with relevant bacterial growth in their mef swabs, 113 (11.7%) had streptococcus pyogenes, 97 (10.1%) staphylococcus aureus, 88 (9.1%) streptococcus pneumoniae, 63 (6.5%) haemophilus influenzae, and 8 (0.8%) moraxella catarrhalis. s. pneumoniae isolates decreased from 41 (9.3%) in year 1 to 12 (5.7%) in year 3 (p = 0.128). pcv7 serotypes accounted for only 7.9% (n = 7) of isolated pneumococci. of the 877 subjects with nps cultures, 465 (53.0%) carried s. pneumoniae, 314 (35.8%) h. influenzae, 292 (33.3%) m. catarrhalis, and 110 (12.5%) s. pyogenes; 79.4% (n = 765) of the children were vaccinated with at least one dose of pcv. carriage of pneumococci was slightly lower in vaccinated (47.8%) than in unvaccinated (52.7%) children (p = 0.254). pcv7 serotypes were carried by 9.6% of unvaccinated children but by only 4.2% of vaccinated children, resulting in a 56.3% vaccine effectiveness. conclusions: following universal pcv7 immunization, a clear epidemiological impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was observed as pcv7 serotypes have almost disappeared among aom.

AB  == influenza virus infections are associated with a significant number of illnesses  and deaths on an annual basis. many of the deaths are due to complications from secondary bacterial invaders, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus  aureus, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus pyogenes. the beta-hemolytic bacteria s. pyogenes colonizes both skin and respiratory surfaces, and frequently presents clinically as strep throat or impetigo. however, when these bacteria gain access to normally sterile sites, they can cause deadly diseases including sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, and pneumonia. we previously developed a model of  influenza virus:s. pyogenes super-infection, which we used to demonstrate that vaccination against influenza virus can limit deaths associated with a secondary  bacterial infection, but this protection was not complete. in the current study,  we evaluated the efficacy of a vaccine that targets the m protein of s. pyogenes  to determine whether immunity toward the bacteria alone would allow the host to survive an influenza virus:s. pyogenes super-infection. our data demonstrate that vaccination against the m protein induces igg antibodies, in particular those of  the igg1 and igg2a isotypes, and that these antibodies can interact with macrophages. ultimately, this vaccine-induced immunity eliminated death within our influenza virus:s. pyogenes super-infection model, despite the fact that all  m protein-vaccinated mice showed signs of illness following influenza virus inoculation. these findings identify immunity against bacteria as an important component of protection against influenza virus:bacteria super-infection.

TI  == susceptibility of common bacterial respiratory pathogens to antimicrobial agents  in outpatients from south backa district.
AB  == introduction: acute infections of the upper respiratory tract are the most common reasons why patients visit general practitioners. overuse of antibiotics in treatment of these conditions is extremely common practice although these infections are most frequently caused by viruses. the aim of this study was to determine the distribution and susceptibility of common pathogens to antimicrobial agents that cause infections of the upper respiratory tract in outpatients and to determine whether the results obtained from the examined sample were in accordance with the recommendations of the current national guideline. material and methods: the study included 945 strains isolated from the throat and nasal swabs from january 1st to march 31st, 2008, as well as from 330  strains isolated from january 1st to march 31st, 2013 in south backa district, serbia. susceptibility tests were performed by the standard disc diffusion method and according to the criteria recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. results: the most commonly isolated strains were streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, branchamella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae. susceptibility of streptococcus pyogenes, branchamella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae to examined antibiotics did not substantially change over the two study periods. none of the isolates of staphylococcus aures demonstrated resistance to methicillin in 2008, while the percentage of resistant strains was 5.93% in 2013. susceptibility rates of staphylococcus pneumoniae isolates to erythromycin and clindamycin were lower in 2013 than in 2008. conclusion: the investigation results follow the recommendations of the national guideline for the usage of natural penicillin in the treatment of tonsillopharyngitis. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is recommended for the treatment of rhinosinusitis, and second generation cephalosporins are the second choice.

TI  == haemophilus influenzae type b as an important cause of culture-positive acute otitis media in young children in thailand: a tympanocentesis-based, multi-center, cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae) and haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae) are considered major causes of bacterial acute otitis media (aom) worldwide, but data from asia on primary causes of aom are limited. this tympanocentesis-based, multi-center, cross-sectional study assessed bacterial etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of aom in thailand. methods: children 3 to 59 months presenting with aom (< 72 hours of onset) who had not received prescribed antibiotics, or subjects who received prescribed antibiotics but remained symptomatic after 48-72 hours (treatment failures), were eligible. study visits were conducted from april 2008 to august 2009. bacteria were identified from middle ear fluid collected by tympanocentesis or spontaneous otorrhea swab sampling (< 20% of cases). s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae serotypes were determined and antimicrobial resistance was also assessed. results: of the 123 enrolled children, 112 were included in analysis and 48% of the 118 samples were  positive for s. pneumoniae (23% (27/118)), h. influenzae (18% (21/118)), moraxella catarrhalis (6% (7/118)) or streptococcus pyogenes (3% (4/118)). the most common pneumococcal serotypes were 19f (26%) and 14 (22%). the majority of h. influenzae isolates were encapsulated (18/21), with 13 type b (hib) representing 62% of all h. influenzae isolate or 11% of all samples (13/118), and there were only 3 non-typeable isolates. despite high antibiotic resistance, amoxicillin/clavulanate susceptibility was high. no pneumococcal vaccine use was  reported. conclusions: s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae, both frequently antibiotic resistant, were leading causes of bacterial aom and there was an unexpectedly high burden of hib in this population unvaccinated by any hib conjugate vaccine. conjugate vaccines effective against pneumococcus and h. influenzae could potentially reduce the burden of aom in this population.

TI  == risk factors for carriage of aom pathogens during the first 3 years of life in children with early onset of acute otitis media.
AB  == conclusion: risk factors associated with increased carriage rates are the same in children with recurrent acute otitis media (raom) as in healthy children. these are also known to be risk factors for the development of aom itself. objectives:  the aim of this study was to describe risk factors for nasopharyngeal carriage in a cohort of young children at high risk of developing raom. methods: children with an onset of aom before 6 months of age, indicating an 80% risk of developing raom, were enrolled in a vaccination trial on heptavalent pcv. these children were monitored for 3 years during healthy and aom periods with nasopharyngeal cultures, physical examinations, and questionnaires. results: a total of 109 children were included at a mean age of 5 months; 105 were followed for 3 years,  89 (82%) of whom developed raom. risk factors associated with increased carriage  of all major aom pathogens were age <2 years, concurrent aom, and fulfilment of raom criteria. having siblings in day care was associated with increased carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, recent antibiotic treatment was associated with h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis carriage, and winter season was associated with m. catarrhalis carriage alone.

TI  == trends in macrolide resistance of respiratory tract pathogens in the paediatric population in serbia from 2004 to 2009.
AB  == we report the first study of macrolide resistance in respiratory tract pathogens  in a serbian paediatric population. it included 5293 streptococcus pneumoniae, 4297 streptococcus pyogenes, 2568 moraxella catarrhalis and 1998 haemophilus influenzae isolates derived from the respiratory tract and 110 invasive isolates  from children aged up to 18 years during 2004-2009. over the 6-year period, a significant increase (p < 0.01) in macrolide resistance was found in both s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes that reached 45% and 19%, respectively, in 2009. in the same period, consumption of macrolides increased continually from 2.46 to 5.8 defined daily dose/1000 inhabitants per day. the increase in macrolide resistance in s. pyogenes correlated with consumption of total macrolide and long-acting macrolides (r = 0.879, p = 0.05 and r = 0.922, p = 0.026, respectively). a similar trend was observed in pneumoccoci, although it did not reach statistical  significance. the growing problem of macrolide resistance in pneumococci and s. pyogenes in serbia requires further vigilant surveillance.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial recovery and viability from three different swab transport systems.
AB  == this study evaluated three types of swab transport systems for organism recovery. swabs with transport media were further assessed for organism viability over 24 hours over a range of different storage temperatures. test organisms consisted of aerobes, fastidious aerobes and anaerobes. swabs were tested according to the standardised quantitative elution method published by the clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi; m-40a). there were substantial differences in primary  organism recovery, with recovery rates from different swabs ranging from <0.1% to 78% for streptococcus pyogenes. similar differences were noted for other test organisms. in general, the flocked swab (eswab) demonstrated highest rates of recovery for aerobic organisms, while higher rates of recovery of fusobacterium nucleatum were demonstrated from a standard swab (transwab). when considering organism viability, no single swab fulfilled all the criteria stipulated by the m-40a standard for all organism/temperature combinations. organism viability was  marginally better for the gel-based swab transport systems as compared to the liquid-media based eswab. significant differences between swab transport systems  were demonstrated, including differences for primary organism recovery and viability. the eswab showed the best recovery of organisms, while gel-based media demonstrated marginally better bacterial viability for most tested retention times and temperatures.

TI  == [antibiotherapy of severe ent infections in children: propositions of the french  group of pediatric infectious diseases (pid) of the french society of pediatrics].
AB  == the french group of pediatric infectious diseases (pid) of the french society of  pediatrics found necessary to issue in 2011 therapeutic proposals concerning antibiotic treatment in severe ent infections in children (acute mastoiditis, severe sinusitis, peripharyngeal abscess). they took into account, for each clinical situation, published studies and existing guidelines, the most frequently encountered bacterial species, their usual sensitivity to antibiotics, their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) characteristics. these propositions aim to ensure the proper use of antibiotics and to limit the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics by minimizing the use of broadspectrum molecules, especially cephalosporins and penems. these infections are often multi microbial and respond to aerobic flora similar to that found in non severe community acquired ent infections and soft tissue infections ( streptococcus pyogenes or group a streptococcus(gas), streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae). anaerobic flora may be associated and implicated in some situations. in most cases, high-dosage of amoxicillin +/- clavulanic acid offers the best pk/pd profile and allows to avoid the overuse of injectable third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == identification of intracellular bacteria in adenoid and tonsil tissue specimens:  the efficiency of culture versus fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish).
AB  == monocyte/macrophage cells from human nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue can be a source of bacteria responsible for human chronic and recurrent upper respiratory  tract infection. detection and characterization of pathogens surviving intracellularly could be a key element in bacteriological diagnosis of the infections as well as in the study on interactions between bacteria and their host. the present study was undertaken to assess the possibility of isolation of  viable bacteria from the cells expressing monocyte/macrophage marker cd14 in nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue. overall, 74 adenotonsillectomy specimens (adenoids and tonsils) from 37 children with adenoid hypertrophy and recurrent infections as well as 15 specimens from nine children with adenoid hypertrophy, which do not suffer from upper respiratory tract infections (the control group),  were studied. the suitability of immunomagnetic separation for extraction of cd14(+) cells from lymphoid tissue and for further isolation of the intracellular pathogens has been shown. the coexistence of living pathogens including haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes with the bacteria representing normal nasopharyngeal microbiota inside cd14(+) cells was demonstrated. twenty-four strains of these pathogens from 32.4 % of the lysates of cd14(+) cells were isolated. concurrently, the fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) with a universal eub388, and the species-specific probes demonstrated twice more often the persistence of these bacterial species in the lysates of cd14(+) cells than conventional culture. although the fish technique appears to be more sensitive than traditional culture in the intracellular bacteria identification, the doubts on whether the bacteria are alive, and therefore, pathogenic would still exist without the strain cultivation.

AB  == objectives: group a streptococci (gas) cause, among other infections, pharyngotonsillitis in children. the species is frequently localized with the gram-negative respiratory pathogens non-typeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) and moraxella catarrhalis, which both produce outer membrane vesicles (omvs). the aim of this study was to investigate whether omvs isolated from nthi contain functional beta-lactamase and whether the omvs hydrolyse amoxicillin and thus protect gas from killing by the antibiotic. methods: the antibiotic susceptibility of isolates was determined using the etest. the resistance genes blatem-1 (encoding nthi beta-lactamase), bro-1 (encoding m. catarrhalis beta-lactamase) and ftsi (encoding nthi penicillin-binding protein 3) were searched for by pcr, followed by sequencing. omvs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and the presence of beta-lactamase was detected by western blots including specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies. the chromogenic substrate  nitrocefin was used to quantify and compare the beta-lactamase enzyme activity in the omvs. the hydrolysis of amoxicillin by beta-lactamase was estimated by an agar diffusion method. results: we showed that omvs released from beta-lactam-resistant m. catarrhalis and nthi contain functional beta-lactamase that hydrolyses amoxicillin and protects gas from killing by amoxicillin. conclusions: this is the first report of the presence of beta-lactamase in nthi omvs. we suggest that omv-derived beta-lactamase from coinfecting pathogens such  as nthi and m. catarrhalis may contribute to the occasional treatment failures seen in gas tonsillitis.

TI  == clinical manifestations and microbiology of acute otitis media with spontaneous otorrhea in children.
AB  == background/purpose(s): in taiwan, clinical and microbiological data on acute otitis media (aom) with spontaneous otorrhea in children are limited. methods: we retrospectively collected data on children with aom and spontaneous otorrhea between january 2011 and june 2012. otorrhea samples were collected using sterile swabs and sent for cultures. pathogens found were streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. pneumococcal isolates collected from october 2011 to june  2012 were serotyped. results: a total of 92 patients were enrolled in the study for demographic and microbiological analysis. their median age was 2.5 years. after excluding those with lobar pneumonia, 84 patients were included for analysis of clinical manifestation. the mean febrile duration was 6 days. leukocytosis and c-reactive protein (crp) level >50 mg/l were noted in 29 (34.5%) patients and 38 (45.2%) patients, respectively. patients with pneumococcal infection were older (p = 0.007) and had more severe symptoms [fever (p = 0.001), otalgia (p = 0.055), respiratory symptoms (p = 0.002-0.03), and higher crp level  (p = 0.015)] than children with other bacterial infection. otorrhea cultures were obtained from 69 (75%) patients, of whom 52 had definitive aom pathogens. the most common causative pathogen was s. pneumoniae (61.5%), followed by s. aureus (36.5%). serotype 19a accounted for two-thirds of pneumococcal isolates and had a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (66.7%) and ceftriaxone (83.3%). conclusion: s. pneumoniae was found to be the most important source of aom with spontaneous otorrhea in children and caused more severe symptoms. serotype 19a, which was usually nonsusceptible to antimicrobial agents, was the most prevalent  serotype in these patients.

TI  == microbiology of bacteria causing recurrent acute otitis media (aom) and aom treatment failure in young children in spain: shifting pathogens in the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination era.
AB  == objective: to prospectively identify the bacterial aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of problematic (recurrent and treatment failure) acute otitis media in spanish children several years after the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. methods: tympanocentesis or careful sampling of spontaneous otorrhoea was performed on children aged 3 to <36 months with recurrent acute otitis media, acute otitis media treatment failure or unresolved  acute otitis media. results: 105 acute otitis media episodes (77 sampled by tympanocentesis, 28 otorrhoea samples) were evaluated: 46 recurrent, 35 treatment failures, 24 unresolved acute otitis media. 74 episodes (70.4%) had at least one  bacterium identified on culture: streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 21 episodes, haemophilus influenzae (all non-typeable) in 44, streptococcus pyogenes in 2, moraxella catarrhalis in 2. no statistically significant difference in bacterial aetiology by episode type was detected. non-typeable h. influenzae was  the most commonly isolated pathogen in all acute otitis media types and in all age sub-groups. forty percent of s. pneumoniae isolates were multi-drug resistant. pneumococcal serotype 19a was the most frequently identified serotype  (7/21 episodes). multi-drug resistance was found in 56% of 19a isolates. of non-typeable h. influenzae isolates, 15% were ampicillin resistant and 13% were amoxicillin/clavulanate resistant. s. pneumoniae and non-typeable h. influenzae dna were each detected in 57% of samples culture negative for these pathogens, including 12 co-infections. conclusion: combining culture and polymerase chain reaction results, h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae may be implicated in 70% and 43% of clinically problematic bacterial acute otitis media episodes, respectively. the impact of new vaccines to prevent both s. pneumoniae and non-typeable h. influenzae acute otitis media may be substantial in this population and is worth investigating.

TI  == antibody to a conserved antigenic target is protective against diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens.
AB  == microbial capsular antigens are effective vaccines but are chemically and immunologically diverse, resulting in a major barrier to their use against multiple pathogens. a beta-(1-->6)-linked poly-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (pnag) surface capsule is synthesized by four proteins encoded in genetic loci designated intercellular adhesion in staphylococcus aureus or polyglucosamine in  selected gram-negative bacterial pathogens. we report that many microbial pathogens lacking an identifiable intercellular adhesion or polyglucosamine locus produce pnag, including gram-positive, gram-negative, and fungal pathogens, as well as protozoa, e.g., trichomonas vaginalis, plasmodium berghei, and sporozoites and blood-stage forms of plasmodium falciparum. natural antibody to pnag is common in humans and animals and binds primarily to the highly acetylated glycoform of pnag but is not protective against infection due to lack of deposition of complement opsonins. polyclonal animal antibody raised to deacetylated glycoforms of pnag and a fully human igg1 monoclonal antibody that both bind to native and deacetylated glycoforms of pnag mediated complement-dependent opsonic or bactericidal killing and protected mice against local and/or systemic infections by streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, neisseria meningitidis serogroup b, candida albicans, and p. berghei anka, and against colonic pathology in a model of infectious colitis. pnag is also a capsular polysaccharide for neisseria gonorrhoeae and nontypable hemophilus influenzae, and protects cells from environmental stress. vaccination targeting pnag could contribute to immunity against serious and diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens, and the conserved production of pnag suggests that it is a critical factor in microbial biology.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of prulifloxacin in comparison with other fluoroquinolones against community-acquired urinary and respiratory pathogens isolated in greece.
AB  == prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone rather recently introduced in certain european countries. we compared the antimicrobial potency of ulifloxacin with that of other fluoroquinolones against  common urinary and respiratory bacterial pathogens. the microbial isolates were prospectively collected between january 2007 and may 2008 from patients with community-acquired infections in greece. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin (for respiratory isolates only), and ulifloxacin using the e-test method. the binary logarithms of the mics [log2(mics)] were compared by using the wilcoxon signed-ranks test. a total of 409 isolates were studied. ulifloxacin had the lowest geometric mean mic for the 161 escherichia coli, 59 proteus mirabilis, and 22 staphylococcus saprophyticus urinary isolates, the second lowest geometric mean mic for the 38 streptococcus pyogenes respiratory isolates (after moxifloxacin), and the third lowest geometric mean mic for the 114 haemophilus influenzae and the 15 moraxella catarrhalis respiratory isolates (after ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). compared with levofloxacin, ulifloxacin had lower log2(mics) against e. coli (p < 0.001),  p. mirabilis (p < 0.001), s. saprophyticus (p < 0.001), and s. pyogenes (p < 0.001). compared with ciprofloxacin, ulifloxacin had lower log2(mics) against p.  mirabilis (p < 0.001), s. saprophyticus (p = 0.008), and s. pyogenes (p < 0.001), but higher log2(mics) against h. influenzae (p < 0.001) and m. catarrhalis (p = 0.001). in comparison with other clinically relevant fluoroquinolones, ulifloxacin had the most potent antimicrobial activity against the community-acquired urinary isolates studied and very good activity against the respiratory isolates.

TI  == acute otitis media in infants younger than three months not vaccinated against streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the true incidence of acute otitis media (aom) in neonates and infants younger than three months is unknown. in this population organisms causing aom may disseminate leading to bacteremia, sepsis, and meningitis [1]. objectives: to describe the clinical presentation, associated severe infections, bacteriologic etiology, and antibiotic resistance patterns of organisms isolated from the middle ear of infants younger than three months that were not vaccinated against  streptococcus pneumoniae. methods: otomicroscopy was performed in all children to confirm the suspected diagnosis of aom. when purulent effusion retained in the middle ear was diagnosed, tympanocentesis and culture of middle-ear fluid was performed by conventional methods. serotyping was done using the quellung technique. results: from may 2, 2009 to february 28, 2010, 52 infants met the inclusion criteria. thirty-six were male (69.2%) and 16 were female (30.8%). from these 52 patients, 76 samples were obtained for culture. bilateral acute suppurative otitis media was diagnosed in 24 (46.2%) infants. of all infants, 18  (34.6%) had been treated with antibiotics before tympanocentesis. eight patients  (44.4%) had negative middle-ear fluid cultures. sixty bacterial pathogens were isolated from the middle-ear fluid of 43 patients. mixed infections were recorded in 14/52 patients (26.9%). nine cultures were negative (17.3%), of which eight were from patients that had previously been treated with antibiotics. s. pneumoniae was isolated from middle-ear aspirates of 26/52 (50%) patients with acute suppurative otitis media. twenty-two out of the 26 isolates were susceptible (84.7%) and four were intermediately susceptible to penicillin (15.3%). streptococcus pyogenes was isolated in 3/52 (5.8%) and haemophilus influenzae in 18/52 patients (34.6%). five (27.8%) of these were beta-lactamase producers. blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine cultures were negative. parenteral antimicrobial treatment was indicated in 29/52 (56%). conclusions: s.  pneumoniae is the most frequent pathogen to cause aom in this age group. empirical treatment with amoxicillin or ceftriaxone should be considered depending on clinical suspicion of severe invasive infection.

TI  == pneumococcal acute otitis media in infants and children in central romania, 2009-2011: microbiological characteristics and potential coverage by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.
AB  == objective: to assess the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of pneumococcal acute otitis media (aom) in children in brasov, central romania, before the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv) into the routine  national immunization program. methods: all aom patients aged <5 years who underwent tympanocentesis or presented with purulent otorrhea of </=24h duration  during 2009-2011 were enrolled. results: two hundred and twelve consecutive aom patients had a middle ear fluid (mef) culture performed; 99 (46.6%) episodes occurred in patients <12 months of age. one hundred and eleven (52.4%) episodes were culture-positive. tympanocentesis was performed in 142 patients and spontaneous otorrhea cultures in 70 patients. overall, 114 pathogens were recovered: streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolate (81 isolates, 70.3% of all culture-positive episodes), followed by non-typeable haemophilus influenzae (26, 20.7%), streptococcus pyogenes (5, 4.5%), and moraxella catarrhalis (2, 1.8%). antibiotic susceptibility and serotyping were performed for 48 (59.3%) s. pneumoniae isolates: 45 (93.8%) were non-susceptible to penicillin (minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) >/=2.0mug/ml in 24, 53.3%) and 37 (77.1%) isolates had ceftriaxone mic values >/=0.5mug/ml (16 with mic >2.0mug/ml). s. pneumoniae non-susceptibility rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, and clindamycin were 75.0%, 58.3%, and 35.4%, respectively. all isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. multidrug resistance was found in 33 (68.7%) isolates. the most common s. pneumoniae serotypes were 19f (14, 29.2%), 6b (8, 16.7%), 23f (8, 16.7%), and 14  (6, 12.5%). serotype 19a was found in three (6.2%) patients and 6a in two (4.1%). non-pcv13 serotypes represented six (12.6%) of all serotypes (four of them non-susceptible to penicillin). thirty-six (75.0%) isolates were potentially covered by pcv7, 37 (77.0%) by pcv10, and 42 (87.5%) by pcv13. conclusions: (1) s. pneumoniae was the most prevalent pathogen, with frequent antibiotic resistance and multi-resistance patterns; (2) most pneumococcal aom and multidrug-resistant episodes could be prevented by pcvs.

AB  == acute rhinosinusitis is a common illness in children. viral upper respiratory tract infection is the most common presentation of rhinosinusitis. most children  resolve the infection spontaneously and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. the proper choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the likely infecting pathogens, bacterial antibiotic resistance, and pharmacologic profiles of antibiotics. amoxicillin-clavulanate is currently recommended as the empiric treatment in those requiring antimicrobial therapy. isolation of the causative agents should be considered in those who failed the initial treatment. in addition to antibiotics, adjuvant therapies and surgery may be used in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

TI  == comparative analysis of the antibacterial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, gsk1322322.
AB  == gsk1322322 is a novel peptide deformylase (pdf) inhibitor being developed for the intravenous and oral treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. the activity of gsk1322322 was tested against a global collection of clinical isolates of haemophilus influenzae (n = 2,370), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 115),  streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 947), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 617), and staphylococcus aureus (n = 940), including strains resistant to one or more marketed antibiotics. gsk1322322 had an mic(90) of 1 mug/ml against m. catarrhalis and 4 mug/ml against h. influenzae, with 88.8% of beta-lactamase-positive strains showing growth inhibition at that concentration.  all s. pneumoniae strains were inhibited by </= 4 mug/ml of gsk1322322, with an mic(90) of 2 mug/ml. pre-existing resistance mechanisms did not affect its potency, as evidenced by the mic(90) of 1 mug/ml for penicillin, levofloxacin, and macrolide-resistant s. pneumoniae. gsk1322322 was very potent against s. pyogenes strains, with an mic(90) of 0.5 mug/ml, irrespective of their macrolide  resistance phenotype. this pdf inhibitor was also active against s. aureus strains regardless of their susceptibility to methicillin, macrolides, or levofloxacin, with an mic(90) of 4 mug/ml in all cases. time-kill studies showed  that gsk1322322 had bactericidal activity against s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus, demonstrating a >/= 3-log(10) decrease in the number  of cfu/ml at 4x mic within 24 h in 29 of the 33 strains tested. given the antibacterial potency demonstrated against this panel of organisms, gsk1322322 represents a valuable alternative therapy for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by drug-resistant pathogens.

AB  == background: we studied nasopharyngeal (np) colonization in a cohort of children to determine the impact of viral upper respiratory infections (uris) on nonpneumococcal alpha-hemolytic streptococci (ahs) and otopathogen colonization in association with acute otitis media (aom). methods: np samples were collected  routinely when children were aged 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24 and 30 months and during episodes of aom. np samples were prospectively obtained from 248 children during  a 5-year time span: 1018 during routine visits, 161 at the time of aom and 59 at  follow-up visits 3 weeks after aom. results: the overall np colonization rate of  ahs was 50.8% during a non-aom visit but declined to 38.3% during a viral uri with concurrent aom (p = 0.0006). of 56 aom visits with paired follow-ups, 6 (10.7%) had ahs in the np at the time of viral uri and concurrent aom whereas 29  (51.8%) had ahs at the follow-up (p < 0.001). lower np colonization rates with ahs were associated with significant increases in streptococcus pneumoniae carriage during non-aom visits (p < 0.001) and during viral uri and concurrent aom visits (p = 0.003). ahs np colonization rates were not different when children had a viral uri without aom versus when they were uri negative, but np colonization with nontypeable haemophilus influenzae rates increased (p < 0.001)  and moraxella catarrhalis decreased (p < 0.001) during viral uri. conclusion: respiratory viral infections alter np carriage rates of commensal ahs and otopathogens, including before aom.

AB  == purpose: to evaluate the microbiology of acute otitis media (aom) with otorrhea due to spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation (stmp) in children living in milan, italy. methods: we evaluated middle ear fluid (mef) specimens taken from children affected by aom associated with stmp and otorrhea between january 2001 and december 2011. the fluid was collected by means of direct swab sampling, sent for culture, and processed within 4 h. results: a total of 705 specimens were obtained from 458 children (233 boys; mean age +/- sd 28.3 +/- 19.9 months), and  were positive for bacteria in 487 cases (69.1 %). the most frequently cultured infectious agent in single-pathogen cultures was haemophilus. influenzae (51.0 %), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (19.4 %), streptococcus pyogenes (17.4 %), and staphylococcus aureus (10.7 %). after adjusting for the sub-period of data collection, age, gender, and previous full heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv-7) schedule, it was found that the prevalence of h. influenzae slightly increased in 2008-2010, and the prevalence of s. pneumoniae significantly decreased over time (p = 0.02). conclusions: aom with stmp is a particular form of aom in which s. pyogenes plays a significant causative role although, as in uncomplicated cases, h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae retain their etiological importance. the frequency of the detection of s. aureus in mef deserves further study because this pathogen can give rise to severe clinical problems. finally, although the use of pcv-7 was relatively efficacious, the benefit of pneumococcal vaccination would be increased by vaccines including a larger number of serotypes.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

AB  == sm-295291 and sm-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such  as methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with mic(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. unlike tebipenem (mic(50), 8 mug/ml), sm-295291 and sm-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(50), >/=  128 mug/ml). the bactericidal activities of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. the therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. sm-295291 and sm-369926 showed intravenous  pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase i. sm-368589 and sm-375769, which are medoxomil esters of sm-295291 and sm-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral,  oral, and switch therapies.

AB  == background/purpose: acute otitis media (aom) is one of the most common diseases in children. here, we describe the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of aom in taiwanese children over a 10-year period. methods: we retrospectively enrolled pediatric patients with culture-proven aom who were treated at mackay memorial hospital, taipei between 1999-2008. the data include demographic characteristics, clinical history, and microbiological characteristics. results: six hundred and fourteen patients were included. the male:female ratio was 1.4 (p<0.001). greater than three-fourths of the patients (476 [77.5%]) were < 5 years of age, and most patients were 1-2 years of age. the most common isolated pathogen was streptococcus pneumoniae (419 patients [68.2%]), followed by nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi; 118 patients [19.2%]). the distributions of age, gender, use of tympanocentesis, history of previous aom, and use of antibiotic between patients infected with the two pathogens were not significantly different. however, the number of patients with  aom caused by s. pneumoniae, but not nthi, decreased during the study period (p=0.004). three hundred and eighty-seven children (63.0%) with aom developed spontaneous otorrhea. compared with patients who underwent tympanocentesis, those with spontaneous otorrhea were younger (27.0+/-16.4 vs. 31.1+/-15.2 months of age, p=0.004), more likely to have a previous history of aom (p=0.019), and more  likely to receive more antibiotics (p=0.012). the third most common pathogen was  s. pyogenes (25 patients [4.1%]). s. pyogenes occurred more often in children > 5 years of age and was associated with spontaneous otorrhea (p<0.001). conclusion:  s. pneumoniae and nthi are common causes of culture-confirmed aom in taiwanese children. although s. pyogenes is not as common, it usually causes aom in children > 5 years of age and is associated with spontaneous otorrhea.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic activity of clofoctol.
AB  == the aim of the study was to examine the in vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens to clofoctol compared with amoxicillin and erythromycin, and to characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) relationships of clofoctol using a murine pneumonia infection model. strains clinically isolated from patients between 2005 and 2009 were used to examine susceptibility: penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and haemophilus influenzae. the in vitro activity of clofoctol against clinical isolates has essentially remained unchanged over recent years. the mic(5)(0) and  mic(9)(0) of clofoctol against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae are lower than  that of amoxicillin and erythromycin. the area under curve/minimum inhibitory concentration (auc/mic) ratio is the pk/pd parameter that best correlates with in vivo clofoctol efficacy; the value of auc/mic required to achieve the maximum effect in this study was 75.5.

TI  == interim susceptibility testing for ceftaroline, a new mrsa-active cephalosporin:  selecting potent surrogate beta-lactam markers to predict ceftaroline activity against clinically indicated species.
AB  == ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the united states food and drug administration in october 2010. in over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore  requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility.  an alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the usa. very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) at </= 8 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing s. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone mic at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible category) when testing haemophilus influenzae. only when testing indicated enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). these presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.

TI  == [acute otitis media: prevalence of ear pathogens in patients at a public hospital].
AB  == background and objective: acute otitis media (aom) is one of the most common diseases in childhood and is the most common cause of antibiotic prescriptions in children. the gold standard for identifying the pathogens causing aom is tympanocentesis. this is only possible in the stage of aom when exudate is retained in the middle ear. the aim of this study was to describe the prevalence  of organisms causing aom in eutrophic patients at a public paediatric hospital. material and methods: we included all patients with aom diagnosed by otomicroscopy with purulent exudate retained in middle ear and suppurative aom with inadequate drainage consulting at the otorhinolaryngology department in a paediatric tertiary care centre from 2 may 2009 to 31 august 2010. results: there were 324 patients included in the study, with 180/324 (55.6%) being male. the median age was 8 months (interquartile range: 4 to 15 months). bilateral aom was  recorded in 109/324 (33.6%) patients (433 samples for culture were obtained by tympanocentesis in 324 patients). at diagnosis, 37% (120/324) of the children had been receiving antimicrobial treatment. of the patients who had received antibiotics, 71/120 (59.1%) had bacterial growth in middle ear fluid (mef) cultures, with 51/71 (71.8%) being susceptible to the antibiotic they received; 20/71 (28.2%) patients were receiving an antibiotic that did not cover the spectrum of organisms isolated. conclusion: the pathogens most frequently isolated are streptococcus pneumoniae (39.5%), haemophilus influenzae (37.4%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.1%) and streptococcus pyogenes (3.0%).

TI  == glycerol monolaurate antibacterial activity in broth and biofilm cultures.
AB  == background: glycerol monolaurate (gml) is an antimicrobial agent that has potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria. this study examines gml antibacterial activity in comparison to lauric acid, in broth cultures compared to biofilm cultures, and against a wide range of gram-positive, gram-negative, and non-gram  staining bacteria. methodology/principal findings: gml is >/= 200 times more effective than lauric acid in bactericidal activity, defined as a >/= 3 log reduction in colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes in broth cultures. both molecules inhibit superantigen production by these organisms at concentrations that are not bactericidal. gml prevents biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, as representative gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, tested in 96 well microtiter plates, and simultaneously is bactericidal for both organisms in mature biofilms. gml is bactericidal for a wide range of potential bacterial pathogens, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. in the presence of acidic ph and the cation chelator ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid,  gml has greatly enhanced bactericidal activity for pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. solubilization of gml in a nonaqueous delivery vehicle (related to k-y warming(r)) enhances its bactericidal activity against s. aureus. both r and s, and 1 and 2 position lauric acid derivatives of gml exhibit bactericidal activity. despite year-long passage of staphylococcus aureus on sub-growth inhibitory concentrations of gml (0.5 x minimum bactericidal concentration), resistance to gml did not develop. conclusions/significance: gml  may be useful as a broad-spectrum human or animal topical microbicide and may be  useful as an environmental surface microbicide for management of bacterial infections and contamination.

TI  == identification of genes that contribute to the pathogenesis of invasive pneumococcal disease by in vivo transcriptomic analysis.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) continues to be responsible for a high level of global morbidity and mortality resulting from pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and otitis media. here we have used a novel technique involving niche-specific, genome-wide in vivo transcriptomic analyses to identify genes upregulated in distinct niches during pathogenesis after intranasal infection of mice with serotype 4 or 6a pneumococci. the analyses yielded 28 common, significantly upregulated genes in the lungs relative to those in the nasopharynx and 25 significantly upregulated genes in the blood relative to those in the lungs in both strains, some of which were previously unrecognized. the role of five upregulated genes from either the lungs or the blood in pneumococcal pathogenesis and virulence was then evaluated by targeted mutagenesis. one of the mutants (deltamalx) was significantly attenuated for virulence in the lungs, two  (deltaalia and deltailvh) were significantly attenuated for virulence in the blood relative to the wild type, and two others (deltacbio and deltapiua) were completely avirulent in a mouse intranasal challenge model. we also show that the products of alia, malx, and piua are promising candidates for incorporation into  multicomponent protein-based pneumococcal vaccines currently under development. importantly, we suggest that this new approach is a viable complement to existing strategies for the discovery of genes critical to the distinct stages of invasive pneumococcal disease and potentially has broad application for novel protein antigen discovery in other pathogens such as s. pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae  type b, and neisseria meningitidis.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the surveillance committee of japanese society of chemotherapy, japanese association  for infectious diseases, and japanese society for clinical microbiology in 2009:  general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  == for the purpose of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in japan, the japanese society of chemotherapy (jsc) started a survey in 2006. from 2009, jsc continued the survey  in collaboration with the japanese association for infectious diseases and the japanese society for clinical microbiology. the fourth-year survey was conducted  during the period from january and april 2009 by the three societies. a total of  684 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. susceptibility testing was evaluable with 635 strains (130 staphylococcus aureus, 127 streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 streptococcus pyogenes, 123 haemophilus influenzae, 70 moraxella catarrhalis, 78 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 103 pseudomonas aeruginosa). a maximum of 45 antibacterial agents including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), four  aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the clinical and laboratory standard institute (clsi). incidence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was as high as 58.5 %, and that of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp and prsp) was 6.3 % and 0.0 %, respectively. among h. influenzae, 21.1 % of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (abpc)-intermediately resistant (blnai), 18.7 % to be beta-lactamase-non-producing abpc-resistant (blnar), and 5.7 % to be beta-lactamase-producing abpc-resistant (blpar) strains. a high frequency (76.5 %) of beta-lactamase-producing strains has been suspected in moraxella catarrhalis isolates. four (3.2 %) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k.  pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. four isolates (2.5 %) of p. aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9 %) suspected multi-drug resistant strains showing resistance against imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. continuous national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  == bacterial interactions in the nasopharynx - effects of host factors in children attending day-care centers.
AB  == the nasopharynges of preschool children are often colonized by potentially pathogenic bacteria. the interactions between these common pathogens and certain  host factors were investigated in healthy preschool children 1-6 years of age. nasopharynx samples were collected from all 63 children attending a day-care center that experienced an outbreak of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the samples were analyzed for s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae,  moraxella catarrhalis, and group a streptococci. a model for the risk of carrying these bacteria was established using logistic regression. s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae antagonize each other, whereas m. catarrhalis and s. pneumoniae have a positively association. the risk of carrying m. catarrhalis decreases with age. the time spent in day care each week was not shown to influence the rate of carriage of any of these pathogens. the negative effect of h. influenzae on s. pneumoniae is discussed in relation to the carriage of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and possible mechanisms involved in this interaction are presented.

TI  == microbiological aspects of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. we enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). in symptomatic girls,  the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly proteus mirabilis (14.4%), enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and escherichia coli (7.0%). the finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with  vulvovaginitis symptoms. conclusion: the microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. the diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.

TI  == nasopharyngeal biofilm-producing otopathogens in children with nonsevere recurrent acute otitis media.
AB  == objective: bacterial biofilms have been detected in biopsies of the adenoid and middle ear mucosa of otitis-prone children and children with chronic middle otitis media. however, the invasiveness of biopsy makes it unsuitable for routine clinical practice, especially in pediatrics. this study aimed to investigate nasopharyngeal biofilm-producing otopathogens (bpos) of nasopharyngeal swabs (nps) in children with a history of nonsevere recurrent acute otitis media (raom) and healthy controls. study design: a cross-sectional study with planned data collection. setting: university of milan. subjects and methods: transoral nps were taken from infants and children aged 10 months to 11 years with nonsevere raom or healthy controls without adenoid hypertrophy. nasopharyngeal colonization by otopathogens was assessed by means of microbiological cultures and standard bacterial identification, as well as nasopharyngeal bpos by means of spectrophotometric analysis. results: the study involved 113 children (56.6% males; median age 40 months; range, 10-132 months): 58 with a history of nonsevere raom (51.3%) and 55 controls (48.7%). otopathogens were significantly more frequently detected in the raom group (24/58, 41.4%) than in controls (8/55, 14.5%; p = .003); the main pathogens were respectively haemophilus influenzae (12/24, 50.0%) and streptococcus pyogenes (3/8, 37.5%). nasopharyngeal bpos were  more frequently isolated in the raom group (17/58, 29.3%) than in controls (6/55, 10.9%; p = .02). h influenzae (12/17, 70.6%) was confirmed as the main pathogen in the raom group. conclusion: the presence of nasopharyngeal bpos is an important factor favoring raom; it is therefore useful investigating biofilms even in children with nonsevere recurrences of aom without adenoid hypertrophy.

TI  == invasive bacterial infections following influenza: a time-series analysis in montreal, canada, 1996-2008.
AB  == background: shared seasonal patterns, such as between influenza and some respiratory bacterial infections, can create associations between phenomena not causally related. objectives: to estimate the association of influenza with subsequent bacterial infections after full adjustment for confounding by seasonal and long-term trends. methods: time series of weekly counts of notified cases of  invasive infections with haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, in montreal, canada, 1996-2008, were modelled by negative binomial regression, with terms representing seasonal and long-term trends and terms for numbers of positive laboratory tests  for influenza a and b. results: the associations of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae  and n. meningitidis with influenza disappeared after seasonal terms were added to the model. however, the influenza b count remained associated with the s. pyogenes counts for the same week and the following week: s. pyogenes incidence rate ratios were 1.0376 (95% ci: 1.0009-1.0757) and 1.0354 (0.9958-1.0766), respectively, for each increase of 1 in the influenza count. conclusions: influenza b accounts for about 8 percnt; of the incidence of invasive s. pyogenes infections, over and above any effect associated with modellable seasonal and long-term trends. this association of influenza b with s. pyogenes infections can be attributed largely to the years 1997, 2001, 2007 and 2008, when late peaks in  influenza b counts were followed by peaks in s. pyogenes notifications. this finding reinforces the case for universal immunization against influenza, as partial protection against the 'flesh eating disease'.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-saharan africa and asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-saharan africa and asia to the macrolide antibiotics. methods: inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. the data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. results: a total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. in general, there was less macrolide resistance in african than in asian isolates. most african studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. there was very little information available for gram-negative organisms. conclusions: susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in ssa remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against salmonellae spp.  in asia. in urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. however, there is no information  on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.

TI  == discovery of 4''-ether linked azithromycin-quinolone hybrid series: influence of  the central linker on the antibacterial activity.
AB  == a series of novel c-4''-substituted azithromycins was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against a panel of representative erythromycin-susceptible and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (mls) resistant  pathogens. in summary, azithromycin and quinolone substructures merged in a mutually sar-compatible design gave rise to a new class of antimicrobials with an improved spectrum and potency over azithromycin. prototypical analogues 7f and 8f display an improved potency versus azithromycin against gram-positive and fastidious gram-negative pathogens. in particular, these new leads maintain activity against mls-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, they represent an improvement over telithromycin (1) and cethromycin (2) against the fastidious gram-negative pathogen haemophilus influenzae.

AB  == whereas patients with multiple myeloma (mm) have a well-documented susceptibility to infections, this has been less studied in other b-cell disorders, such as waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (wm) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (mgus). we investigated the humoral immunity to 24 different pathogens in elderly patients with mm (n = 25), wm (n = 16), and mgus (n = 18) and in age-matched controls (n = 20). antibody titers against pneumococci, staphylococcal alpha-toxin, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, and varicella, mumps, and rubella viruses were most depressed in mm patients, next to lowest in wm and  mgus patients, and highest in the controls. in contrast, levels of antibodies specific for staphylococcal teichoic acid, moraxella catarrhalis, candida, aspergillus, and measles virus were similarly decreased in mm and mgus patients.  comparable titers in all study groups were seen against haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), borrelia, toxoplasma, and members of the herpesvirus family. finally, a uniform lack of antibodies was noted against streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella, yersinia, brucella, francisella, and herpes simplex virus type 2. to  conclude, although mm patients displayed the most depressed humoral immunity, significantly decreased antibody levels were also evident in patients with wm and mgus, particularly against staphylococcus aureus, pneumococci, and varicella. conversely, immunity was retained for hib and certain herpesviruses in all study  groups.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil: a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftaroline fosamil, the prodrug of the active metabolite, ceftaroline, is a new, broad-spectrum cephalosporin recently approved in the usa for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). ceftaroline has potent in vitro activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as common gram-negative organisms. the high affinity of ceftaroline for penicillin-binding  proteins is responsible for the potent activity observed against clinically relevant pathogens. with respect to the treatment of cabp, the activity of ceftaroline against pathogens such as s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis demonstrates coverage across a broad range of pathogens typically encountered in clinical practice. ceftaroline is also very active against common pathogens seen in absssis such as s. aureus (methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) and streptococcus pyogenes. ceftaroline exhibits a dose-proportional pharmacokinetic  profile, similar to other renally excreted cephalosporins, and has a well-tolerated safety profile consistent with the cephalosporin class. ceftaroline fosamil is compatible via y-site administration with many other commonly administered parenteral drugs.

TI  == bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of peritonsillar abscess.
AB  == introduction: peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute tonsillitis. its management consists of aspiration or surgical drainage followed  by appropriate antibiotics. appropriate antibiotic treatment depends on the common organisms associated with infection and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern in local scenario. methods: pus samples aspirated from diagnosed cases of peritonsillar abscess and submitted for culture and sensitivity in last two years were included in this study. identification of different microorganisms was made  on the basis of the microscopic findings, observation of their colony morphology  and standard biochemical reactions. susceptibility pattern to commonly used antibiotics were determined by clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. results: altogether 24 pus samples were included in the study. positive culture was obtained from 18 samples. among them one organism was isolated from 13 samples whereas from five samples multiple organisms were isolated. from six samples no organisms could be cultured. altogether streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from 12 samples and staphylococcus aureus from five samples. other isolated organisms included haemophlilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus species. penicillin was effective for streptococcus pyogenes whereas staphylococcus aureus was resistant  to it. cloxacillin was found to be effective for staphylococcus aureus. ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were found to be effective for both organisms. conclusions: streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus were more commonly  associated with peritonsillar abscess. streptococcus pyogenes were sensitive to penicillin but all staphylococcus aureus were resistant to it. this fact should be considered in clinical practice for management of peritonsillar abscess.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2008: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  == for the purpose of nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens collected from patients in japan, the japanese society of chemotherapy conducted a third year of nationwide surveillance during  the period from january to april 2008. a total of 1,097 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. susceptibility testing was evaluable with 987 strains (189 staphylococcus aureus, 211 streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 streptococcus pyogenes, 187 haemophilus influenzae, 106 moraxella catarrhalis, 126 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 162 pseudomonas aeruginosa). a total of 44 antibacterial agents,  including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one  monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including a ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the clinical and laboratory standard institute (clsi).  the incidence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was as high as 59.8%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp and prsp) were 35.5 and 11.8%, respectively. among h. influenzae, 13.9% of them were  found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (abpc)-intermediately resistant (blnai), 26.7% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing abpc-resistant (blnar), and 5.3% to be beta-lactamase-producing abpc-resistant (blpar) strains.  a high frequency (76.5%) of beta-lactamase-producing strains was suspected in moraxella catarrhalis isolates. four (3.2%) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. four isolates (2.5%) of p. aeruginosa were found to be metallo beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9%) suspected multidrug-resistant strains showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. continual national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on  a regular basis.

TI  == microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  == most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. the most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (prevotella  and porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with hiv infection, and in cystic fibrosis. fungi and pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. the microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.

TI  == cefditoren in upper and lower community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  == this article reviews and updates published data on cefditoren in the evolving scenario of resistance among the most prevalent isolates from respiratory tract infections in the community (streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and  streptococcus pneumoniae). by relating the in vitro activity of cefditoren (in national and multinational surveillance and against isolates with emerging resistant genotypes/phenotypes) to its pharmacokinetics, the cefditoren pharmacodynamic activity predicting efficacy (in humans, animal models, and in vitro simulations) is analyzed prior to reviewing clinical studies (tonsillopharyngitis, sinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and community-acquired pneumonia) and the relationship between bacterial eradication  and clinical efficacy. the high in vitro activity of cefditoren against the most  prevalent respiratory isolates in the community, together with its pharmacokinetics (enabling a twice daily regimen) leading to adequate pharmacodynamic indexes covering all s. pyogenes, h. influenzae, and at least 95% s. pneumoniae isolates, makes cefditoren an antibiotic that will play a significant role in the treatment of respiratory tract infections in the community. in the clinical setting, studies carried out with cefditoren showed that treatments with the 400 mg twice daily regimen were associated with high rates of bacteriological response, even against penicillin-nonsusceptible s. pneumoniae, with good correlation between bacteriological efficacy/response and clinical outcome.

TI  == etiology of invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children in korea (1996-2005): a retrospective multicenter study.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the major etiological agents responsible for invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent korean children. we retrospectively surveyed invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children caused by eight major pediatric bacteria, namely streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella species that were diagnosed at 18 university hospitals from 1996 to 2005. a total of 768 cases were identified. s. agalactiae (48.1%) and s. aureus (37.2%) were the most common pathogens in infants younger than 3 months. s. agalactiae was a common cause of meningitis (73.0%), bacteremia without localization (34.0%), and arthritis (50%) in this age group. s. pneumoniae (45.3%) and h. influenzae (20.4%) were common in children aged 3 months to 5 yr.  s. pneumoniae was a common cause of meningitis (41.6%), bacteremia without localization (40.0%), and bacteremic pneumonia (74.1%) in this age group. s. aureus (50.6%), salmonella species (16.9%), and s. pneumoniae (16.3%) were common in older children. a significant decline in h. influenzae infections over the last 10 yr was noted. s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus are important pathogens responsible for invasive bacterial infections in korean children.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == nod-like receptors in the human upper airways: a potential role in nasal polyposis.
AB  == background: nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod)-like receptors (nlrs) are newly discovered cytosolic receptors belonging to the pattern-recognition receptor family. they detect various pathogen-associated molecular patterns, triggering an immune response. the knowledge about these receptors, and their role in health and disease, is limited. the aim of the present study was to characterize the expression of nod1, nod2, and nalp3 in the human upper airways.  methods: surgical samples were obtained from patients with tonsillar disease (n = 151), hypertrophic adenoids (n = 9), and nasal polyposis (n = 24). nasal biopsies were obtained from healthy volunteers (n = 10). the expression of nod1, nod2, and nalp3 was analyzed using real-time pcr and immunohistochemistry. results: expression of nod1, nod2, and nalp3 mrna and protein were seen in all tissue specimens. the nlr mrna was found to be higher in nasal polyps than in normal nasal mucosa, and local steroid treatment reduced the nlr expression in polyps. in contrast, tonsillar infection with streptococcus pyogenes or haemophilus influenzae did not affect the nlr expression. conclusions: the present study demonstrates the presence of nlrs in several upper airway tissues and highlights  a potential role of nlrs in chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps.

AB  == the in vitro activities of modithromycin against gram-positive and -negative respiratory pathogens, including macrolide-resistant cocci with different resistance mechanisms, were compared with those of other macrolide and ketolide agents. mics were determined by the broth microdilution method. all 595 test strains used in this study were isolated from japanese medical facilities. the erm (ribosome methylase) and/or mef (efflux pump) gene, which correlated with resistance to erythromycin as well as clarithromycin and azithromycin, was found  in 81.8%, 21.3%, and 23.2% of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) strains, respectively. modithromycin showed mic(90)s of 0.125 mug/ml against these three cocci, including macrolide-resistant strains. in particular, the mic of modithromycin against ermb-carrying s. pyogenes was >/= 32-fold lower than that of telithromycin. the activities of modithromycin as well as telithromycin were little affected by the presence of mefa or mefe in both streptococci. against gram-negative pathogens, modithromycin showed mic(90)s of 0.5, 8, and 0.031 mug/ml against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and legionella spp., respectively. the mics of modithromycin against m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae were higher than those of telithromycin and azithromycin. however, modithromycin showed the most potent anti-legionella activity among the macrolide and ketolide agents tested. these results suggested that the bicyclolide agent modithromycin is a novel class of macrolides with improved antibacterial activity against gram-positive cocci, including telithromycin-resistant streptococci and intracellular gram-negative bacteria of the legionella species.

TI  == novel bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligase inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity and antibacterial efficacy in vivo.
AB  == dna ligases are indispensable enzymes playing a critical role in dna replication, recombination, and repair in all living organisms. bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligase (liga) was evaluated for its potential as a broad-spectrum antibacterial target. a novel class of substituted adenosine analogs was discovered by target-based high-throughput screening (hts), and these compounds were optimized  to render them more effective and selective inhibitors of liga. the adenosine analogs inhibited the liga activities of escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, with inhibitory activities in the nanomolar range. they were selective for bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligases, showing no inhibitory activity against  atp-dependent human dna ligase 1 or bacteriophage t4 ligase. enzyme kinetic measurements demonstrated that the compounds bind competitively with nad+. x-ray  crystallography demonstrated that the adenosine analogs bind in the amp-binding pocket of the liga adenylation domain. antibacterial activity was observed against pathogenic gram-positive and atypical bacteria, such as s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and m. pneumoniae, as well as against gram-negative pathogens, such as h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. the mode of action was verified using recombinant strains with altered liga expression, an okazaki fragment accumulation assay, and the isolation of resistant strains with liga mutations. in vivo efficacy was demonstrated in a murine s. aureus thigh infection model and a murine s. pneumoniae lung infection  model. treatment with the adenosine analogs reduced the bacterial burden (expressed in cfu) in the corresponding infected organ tissue as much as 1,000-fold, thus validating liga as a target for antibacterial therapy.

TI  == toll-like receptor 4 gene (tlr4), but not tlr2, polymorphisms modify the risk of  tonsillar disease due to streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == tonsillar disease (recurrent tonsillitis and/or tonsillar hypertrophy) is one of  the most common human disorders, with streptococcus pyogenes (group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus [gas]) and haemophilus influenzae representing the most common pathogens. until now, no study has investigated why some individuals  are more susceptible to tonsillar infections caused by specific bacteria than others. the aim of this study was to uncover possible associations between common toll-like receptor gene (tlr) polymorphisms and tonsillar disease. the tlr2-r753q, tlr4-d299g, and tlr4-t399i polymorphisms were determined in a cohort  of 327 patients subjected to tonsillectomy due to recurrent tonsillitis (n = 245) and tonsillar hypertrophy (n = 82) and 245 healthy bone marrow donors. associations of the aforementioned polymorphisms with the isolated bacterial strains after tonsillectomy were also investigated. interestingly, carriers of the tlr4 polymorphisms displayed an approximately 3-fold increased risk for gas infections (for tlr4-d299g, odds ratio [or] = 2.81, 95% confidence interval [ci]  = 1.16 to 6.79, p = 0.038; for tlr4-t399i, or = 3.01, 95% ci = 1.29 to 7.02, p =  0.023), and this association was more profound in patients with recurrent tonsillitis. on the contrary, the presence of the tlr4-t399i polymorphism was associated with a 2-fold decreased risk of haemophilus influenzae carriage (or =  0.38, 95% ci = 0.15 to 0.96, p = 0.038). in the end, no significant differences were observed, considering the genotype and allele frequencies of the above-mentioned polymorphisms, between patients and controls. our findings indicate that, regarding tonsillar infections, tlr4 polymorphisms predispose individuals to gas infection, while they are protective against haemophilus influenzae infection. this result further elucidates the role that host immune genetic variations might play in the susceptibility to common infections and tonsillar disease.

TI  == vitronectin in bacterial pathogenesis: a host protein used in complement escape and cellular invasion.
AB  == the multifunctional human glycoprotein vitronectin (vn) plays a significant role  in cell migration, tissue repair and regulation of membrane attack complex (mac)  formation. it also promotes neutrophil infiltration and, thus, enhances the inflammatory process during infection. in the host, a balanced homeostasis is maintained by vn due to neutralization of the self-reactivity of the mac. on the  other hand, vn bound to the bacterial surface protects from mac-mediated lysis and enhances adhesion. gram-negative bacterial pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae use vn recruitment  to prevent mac deposition at their surface. moreover, gram-positive bacterial pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and s. pyogenes utilize vn for effective adhesion to host cells and subsequent internalization. vitronectin has  an arg-gly-asp (rgd) sequence for binding the host cell integrin receptors and a  separate bacterial-binding domain for pathogens, and thus more likely functions to cross-link bacteria and epithelial cells. once bacteria are attached to the vitronectin-integrin complex, various host cell-signalling events are activated and promote internalization. in this review, we focus on the important roles of vitronectin in bacterial pathogenesis and describe different strategies used by pathogens to evade the host response by the help of this intriguing molecule.

TI  == socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of bacteremic pneumonia among us adults.
AB  == objectives: we examined associations between the socioeconomic characteristics of census tracts and racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia among us adults. methods: we analyzed data on 4870 adults aged 18 years or older with community-acquired bacteremic pneumonia identified through active, population-based surveillance in 9 states and geocoded to census tract of residence. we used data from the 2000 us census to calculate incidence by age, race/ethnicity, and census tract characteristics and poisson regression to estimate rate ratios (rrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis). results: during 2003 to 2004, the average annual incidence of bacteremic pneumonia was 24.2 episodes per 100 000 black adults versus 10.1 per 100 000 white adults (rr = 2.40; 95% ci = 2.24, 2.57). incidence among black residents of census tracts with 20% or more of persons in poverty (most impoverished) was 4.4  times the incidence among white residents of census tracts with less than 5% of persons in poverty (least impoverished). racial disparities in incidence were reduced but remained significant in models that controlled for age, census tract  poverty level, and state. conclusions: adults living in impoverished census tracts are at increased risk of bacteremic pneumonia and should be targeted for prevention efforts.

TI  == the viriato study: update on antimicrobial resistance of microbial pathogens responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections in portugal.
AB  == the viriato study is a prospective, multicentre laboratory-based surveillance study of antimicrobial susceptibility in which 30 microbiology laboratories throughout portugal are asked to isolate, identify and submit to a central laboratory for testing streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis responsible for community-acquired lower respiratory tract  infections and streptococcus pyogenes from tonsillitis. to monitor changes in antimicrobial resistance patterns of these frequent respiratory pathogens. susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion (kirby-bauer) or using etest strips following the clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. from 1999 to 2007 over 13 900 isolates were analysed. among s. pneumoniae penicillin non-susceptibility decreased from 25% in 1999 to 18% in 2007 (p = 0.002) but resistance to macrolides showed a steady increase, reaching 20% in the last 6 years. resistance to amoxicillin and the quinolones remained stable and very low  (1-2%) throughout the study period. antimicrobial resistance among h. influenzae  and m. catarrhalis remained stable. the most significant resistance was to ampicillin, of 10-12% and greater than 80%, respectively, as a result of the production of beta-lactamases. macrolide resistance among s. pyogenes was stable  during 1999-2003 (20-23%) but after 2003 there was a steady decline in resistance, which in 2007 reached 10%. the viriato surveillance study showed that penicillin remains the most active antimicrobial agent against s. pyogenes causing tonsillitis, and amoxicillin-clavulanate and the quinolones are the most  active in vitro simultaneously against s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis responsible for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in portugal.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy: focus on cefditoren.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy to commonly used antibiotics including cefditoren. six clinical microbiological laboratories collected, between january and september 2009, a total of 2,510 respiratory pathogens from subjects with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (carti). ceftditoren, out of all the beta-lactams studied, had the lowest mic(90 )against  965 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae examined, followed by cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (2% resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp)). against 470 haemophilus influenzae , independently of their production of beta-lactamases or ampicillin resistance, cefditoren was the oral cephalosporin with the best in  vitro activity, comparable to that of the injectable cephalosporins and levofloxacin. higher mic(90)s were found for the macrolides (4 - 16 mg/l) and cefaclor (4 - 32 mg/l). as was foreseeable, streptococcus pyogenes (225 strains)  was uniformly sensitive to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, but the elevated mic(90 )values reduced (<75%) susceptibility of this pathogen to macrolides. beta-lactamase-negative moraxella catarrhalis (100 strains) had reduced susceptibility only to the macrolides, while the 250 beta-lactamase-producing strains also had reduced susceptibility to cefuroxime. levofloxacin showed the lowest mic(50)/mic(90 )values in the producing strains, whereas cefditoren, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in the non-producers. as regards the enterobacteriaceae, cefditoren and levofloxacin had the lowest mic(90)s against klebsiella pneumoniae. cefditoren and the third-generation injectable cephalosporins had the lowest mic(90)s against escherichia coli (100% susceptibility) while levofloxacin was less active (86% susceptibility).in conclusion, cefditoren's wide spectrum and high intrinsic activity, as well as its capacity to overcome most of the resistance that has become consolidated in some classes of antibiotics widely used as empiric therapy for carti, allows us to suggest that cefditoren might be included in the european guidelines as one of the first-choice antibiotics in the treatment of carti.

TI  == clinical outcomes in mexican children with febrile acute upper respiratory tract  infections: no impact of antibiotic therapy.
AB  == objective: to compare the clinical outcomes (duration of signs and symptoms) and  the microbiology in mexican children with non-complicated febrile upper respiratory tract infections (uri), with and without the use of antibiotics. methods: we conducted a prospective cohort study from september 2006 to july 2007. the study population consisted of 880 children aged 6 months to 5 years 11  months, attending four community daycare centers run by the instituto mexicano del seguro social (imss) and three non-imss daycare centers. children with a febrile uri were enrolled before receiving any antimicrobials and were followed up for two weeks. duration of the fever, cough, runny nose, stuffy nose, irritability, loss of appetite, tiredness, and diarrhea, and isolation of haemophilus influenzae,streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were  compared in those children who received antibiotic treatment and those who did not receive antibiotics. results: during the study period, a total of 145 out of  880 children were enrolled, and among those enrolled, 85/145 (59%) children received antibiotics. there was no significant difference in the duration of the  signs and symptoms evaluated in the two groups. although the proportions of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and s. pyogenes isolated in children with and without  antibiotics were comparable, those in whom we isolated s. pneumoniae had both a significantly longer episode of uri, as well as longer lasting diarrhea. similarly, children receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment experienced significantly longer durations of fever and diarrhea. conclusions: the mean duration of signs and symptoms and the microbiological isolates of children with  febrile uri were comparable among children treated with or without antibiotics, with the exception of a longer duration of uri and diarrhea in those children with an s. pneumoniae isolate. our findings suggest that in our population, most  cases of febrile uri are caused by viral infections, and demonstrate that antibiotics should not be used routinely in children with non-complicated febrile uri.

TI  == activity of a novel series of acylides active against community-acquired respiratory pathogens.
AB  == resistance to macrolides and beta-lactams has increased sharply amongst key respiratory pathogens, leading to major concern. a novel series of acylides was designed to overcome this resistance and was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo activity. this series of acylides was designed starting from clarithromycin by changing the substitution on the desosamine nitrogen, followed by conversion to 3-o-acyl and 11,12-carbamate. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of acylides were determined against susceptible as well as macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mls(b))--and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and moraxella catarrhalis by the agar dilution method. microbroth mics for haemophilus influenzae were determined  according to clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. in vivo efficacy was determined by target organ load reduction against s. pneumoniae 3579 (ermb). the bactericidal potential of promising acylides was also determined. mics of these compounds against s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, h. influenzae and m.  catarrhalis were in the range of 0.06-2, 0.125-1, 1-16 and 0.015-0.5 microg/ml, respectively, irrespective of their resistance pattern. mycoplasma pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila showed mic ranges of 0.004-0.125 microg/ml and 0.004-0.03  microg/ml, respectively. the acylides also showed better activity against telithromycin-resistant s. pneumoniae strains. compounds with a 4-furan-2-yl-1h-imidazolyl side chain on the carbamate (rbx 10000296) showed a target organ load reduction of >3 log(10) colony-forming units/ml and concentration-dependent bactericidal potential against s. pneumoniae 994 mefa and h. influenzae strains. this novel and potent series of acylides active against antibiotic-resistant respiratory pathogens should be further investigated.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of s-013420, a novel bicyclolide, against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of s-013420, a novel bicyclolide, was investigated. methods: all test strains for this study were isolated from japanese medical facilities. mics were determined by the microbroth dilution method or agar dilution method according to the clsi guidelines. in time-kill kinetics, viable cells were measured at 1, 2.5, 4 and 6 h after exposure to antimicrobials. the frequencies of single-step resistance acquisition at 4x mic and 8x mic were determined using 10(7) cfu of bacterial cells. results: s-013420  showed mic(90) values of 0.125, 0.125, 8 and 0.5 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, respectively. s-013420 showed the most potent activity against erythromycin-intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic(90) of 0.25 mg/l and inhibited the growth of all strains of s. pyogenes with macrolide resistance genes at 1 mg/l. the mics of s-013420 for atypical pathogens such as erythromycin-susceptible mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydophila pneumoniae were  0.00049-0.001 and 0.0039 mg/l, respectively, although the activity of s-013420, as well as other macrolide agents, against erythromycin-resistant m. pneumoniae was significantly weak. s-013420 caused a 3 log(10) reduction in viable cells against all test strains of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae. acquisition of resistance to s-013420 was not observed for three strains of s. pneumoniae. conclusions: s-013420 shows potent in vitro activity against respiratory tract pathogens. against streptococci, including erythromycin-resistant strains, s-013420 demonstrated the most potent in vitro activity among the antimicrobials  tested.

TI  == predicting bacteremic pneumonia in hiv-1-infected patients consulting the ed.
AB  == introduction: hiv-1-infected patients have higher incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and risk of complications. bacteremia has been associated with a  higher risk of complications in such patients. we investigated factors associated with bacteremia in hiv-1-infected patients with cap presenting at the emergency department. methods: we included hiv-1-infected patients with cap for 3 years (march 2005-february 2008). only patients in whom blood cultures were performed were finally included. clinical data (age; sex; cd4(+) count; serum hiv viral load; previous or current intravenous drug use and antiretroviral treatment; systolic blood pressure; and cardiac and respiratory rates), analytical data (leukocyte count, arterial oxygen content, c-reactive protein value, and urgent streptococcus pneumoniae and legionella spp antigen urine detection), and apache-ii (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) score were compiled. the need for intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, mortality, and for patients finally discharged, duration of admission were retrospectively obtained from the clinical history. a multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed to find independent predictors of bacteremia. results: we diagnosed 129 hiv-1-infected patients with cap. blood cultures were performed  in 118 cases (91%). bacteremia was present in 28 (24%). independent predictors of bacteremia were the detection of s pneumoniae antigen in urine (odds ratio, 9.0;  95% confidence interval, 1.9-42.0) and the absence of current antiretroviral treatment (odds ratio, 7.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-33.3). in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with bacteremia (15% vs 0%). conclusion: hiv-1-infected patients with cap who are not on current antiretroviral therapy and have positive s pneumoniae antigenuria are at increased risk of having bacteremia. bacteremic patients have a poor outcome.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among respiratory pathogens in spain: latest data and changes over 11 years (1996-1997 to 2006-2007).
AB  == a nationwide multicenter susceptibility surveillance study (susceptibility to the antimicrobials used in the community in espana [sauce] project), sauce-4, including 2,559 streptococcus pneumoniae, 2,287 streptococcus pyogenes, and 2,736 haemophilus influenzae isolates was carried out from may 2006 to june 2007 in 34  spanish hospitals. then, the results from sauce-4 were compared to those from all three previous sauce studies carried out in 1996-1997, 1998-1999, and 2001-2002 to assess the temporal trends in resistance and the phenotypes of resistance over the 11-year period. in sauce-4, on the basis of the clsi breakpoints, penicillin  (parenteral, nonmeningitis breakpoint) and cefotaxime were the antimicrobials that were the most active against s. pneumoniae (99.8% and 99.6%, respectively).  only 0.9% of isolates had a penicillin mic of > or = 2 microg/ml. in s. pyogenes, nonsusceptibility to erythromycin was observed in 19.4% of isolates. among the h. influenzae isolates, a beta-lactamase-positive prevalence of 15.7% was found. a statistically significant temporal decreasing trend over the 11-year period was observed for nonsusceptibility (from 60.0% to 22.9%) and resistance (from 36.5% to 0.9%) to penicillin and for the proportion of erythromycin-resistant isolates  of s. pneumoniae of the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mls(b)) phenotype  (from 98.4% to 81.3%). a similar trend was observed for the prevalence of ampicillin resistance (from 37.6% to 16.1%), beta-lactamase production (from 25.7% to 15.7%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin resistance (blnar) in h.  influenzae (from 13.5% to 0.7%). among erythromycin-resistant isolates of s. pyogenes, a significant increasing trend in the prevalence of mls(b) was observed (from 7.0% to 35.5%). sauce-4 confirms a generalized decline in the resistance of the main respiratory pathogens to the antimicrobials as well as a shift in their  resistance phenotypes.

TI  == are there any differences in the community acquired pneumonias admitted to hospital over the past decade?
AB  == the past few years have seen a decline in community acquired pneumonia (cap) in children in the western world, although this has gone hand-in-hand with more serious cases needing hospital admission. our study characterises cases of cap admitted to hospital and compares this data with a 2001 study. we collected data  on 63 admissions over a six-month period. the majority were aged 0-2 years old. chest x-ray showed consolidation/atelectasy in 58 (92.1%) and pleural effusion (pe) in 17 (27.0%), of which 11 were empyema (17.4% of all admissions). the bacterial agent was isolated in five cases: streptococcus pyogenes (two, pleural  fluid), streptococcus pneumoniae (two, blood culture) and haemophilus influenzae  (one, blood culture). sixty-one children (96.8%) were prescribed antibiotherapy.  the median length of hospital stay was five days. patients with pe were older, had a longer course of fever, higher inflammatory parameters, longer hospital stay and longer course of iv antibiotics. compared to the prior study we found greater severity of cap, with higher prevalence of pe and empyema. nevertheless there was a shorter course of fever during hospital stay and shorter hospital stay. we also noticed less antibiotic prescription prior to admission and greater prescription of ampicillin during hospital stay. in the literature, the higher severity of cap has been partially attributed to the emergence of more aggressive serotypes of stretococcus pneumoniae not included in the heptavalent vaccine. there is therefore a greater interest in new vaccines containing them. complicated cap should be referred to centres specialising in its diagnosis and management.

TI  == broad spectrum respiratory pathogen analysis of throat swabs from military recruits reveals interference between rhinoviruses and adenoviruses.
AB  == military recruits experience a high incidence of febrile respiratory illness (fri), leading to significant morbidity and lost training time. adenoviruses, group a streptococcus pyogenes, and influenza virus are implicated in over half of the fri cases reported at recruit training center clinics, while the etiology  of the remaining cases is unclear. in this study, we explore the carriage rates and disease associations of adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis in military recruits using high-density resequencing microarrays. the results showed that rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and n. meningitidis were widely distributed in recruits. of these five agents, only adenovirus showed significant correlation with illness. among the samples tested, only pathogens associated with fri, such as adenovirus 4 and enterovirus 68, revealed strong temporal and spatial clustering of specific strains, indicating that they are transmitted primarily within sites. the results showed a strong negative association between adenoviral fri and the presence of rhinoviruses in recruits,  suggesting some form of viral interference.

TI  == [resistance study of community respiratory pathogens isolated in china from 2005  to 2007].
AB  == objective: to investigate the antimicrobial resistance of community respiratory pathogens isolated in china. methods: the strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, s. pyogenes were isolated from patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections at 14 chinese hospitals from 2005 to 2007. etest and disk diffusion methods were used to survey the susceptibility of 14 antibiotics against these strains. these antibiotics included penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefprozil, ceftriaxone, cefepime, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (sxt).  results: a total of 1870 strains were collected including s. pneumoniae (n = 997), s. pyogenes (n = 176), h. influenzae (n = 499) and m. catarrhalis (n = 198). the 2005 - 2007 prevalence of penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae (pssp) were 92.6%, 73.9%, 74.1% and penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) 4.5%, 9.5%, 14.3% and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) 2.9%, 16.6%, 11.6% respectively. 36.9% of s. pneumoniae strains isolated from <or= 6 years old children were penicillin-non-susceptive isolates (pnssp) and < 22.0% of pnssp isolated from other age groups. the susceptible rates of beta-lactamase antibiotics to prsp and pisp isolates were less than 25.0% and 49.2% respectively. from 48.5% to 98.6% pssp isolates were susceptible to beta-lactamase antibiotics. the susceptible rates of pnssp and pssp to erythromycin, tetracycline and sxt were below 7.1% and 32.1% respectively. about  95% s. pneumoniae were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin. all of s. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to beta-lactamase antibiotics, and 16.7%, 27.1% and 15.6% of s. pyogenes isolates were susceptible  to erythromycin. 8.5%, 19.9%, 15.3% of h. influenzae and 57.4%, 78.8%, 95.5% of m. catarrhalis produced beta-lactamase during the 3-year period. the susceptible  rates of cefepime, ceftriaxone, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were >or= 92.9%. conclusions: antimicrobial resistance in s. pneumoniae is rising. the prevalence of pnssp isolated from children < or = 6 years old is higher than other age groups. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefepime, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin remain highly active against common community respiratory pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal and anti-inflammatory properties of a standardized echinacea extract (echinaforce): dual actions against respiratory bacteria.
AB  == common symptoms of upper respiratory infections, such as sore throat, cough, and  inflammation, are often caused by bacteria, sometimes as a complication of virus  infection. extracts of echinacea purpurea (asteraceae) have been advocated traditionally for use by individuals suffering from these symptoms, although the  underlying basis for the beneficial effects of echinacea is not known. we hypothesized that echinacea could inactivate certain respiratory bacteria and could also reverse inflammatory effects caused by these bacteria in epithelial cells. in order to test this we used a commercial standardized extract of echinacea purpurea (echinaforce), and a novel cytokine array system designed to measure simultaneously the levels of 20 different cytokines secreted by bronchial epithelial cell cultures in response to infection. streptococcus pyogenes (group  a strep), which is often associated with sore throat and more severe pulmonary infections, was readily inactivated by echinacea, which also completely reversed  the cellular pro-inflammatory response. hemophilus influenzae and legionella pneumophila were also readily inactivated, and their pro-inflammatory responses reversed. staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and sensitive strains) and mycobacterium smegmatis were less sensitive to the bactericidal effects of echinacea however, but their pro-inflammatory responses were still completely reversed. in contrast some other pathogens tested, including candida albicans, were relatively resistant. thus echinaforce) exerts a dual action against several important respiratory bacteria, a killing effect and an anti-inflammatory effect. these results support the concept of using a standardized echinacea preparation to control symptoms associated with bacterial respiratory infections.

AB  == we have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. in this paper, we report the results of an  analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous  years. the common respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (fqs). the resistance of s. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. most strains of enterobacteriaceae except for escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to fqs. almost 30% of e. coli strains were resistant to fqs and the resistance increased further this year. fqs resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (stfx). fqs resistance of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) was low at about 10%. fqs resistance of  methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (mscns), but it  was lower than that of mrsa. however, fqs resistance of mscns was higher than that of mssa. fqs resistance of enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for stfx (58.3%). in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, fqs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of p. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend  as in past years. multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. the carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem  at present, accounted for 2.7%. neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to fqs. the results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and n.  gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against fqs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of select respiratory tract pathogens in dakar, senegal.
AB  == background: haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common causative agents of respiratory tract infections (rtis). the increase in resistance to current antibacterial agents highlights the need to monitor the resistance pattern of these bacterial pathogens. methodology: in this study, we assessed the antibacterial susceptibility of these pathogens causing respiratory tract infections in dakar, senegal, during 2007-2008. a total of 290 bacterial isolates (75 h. influenzae, 10 m. catarrhalis, 105 s. pneumoniae, and 100 s. pyogenes) were collected. results and conclusions: all h. influenzae isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ofloxacin, clarithromycin, cephalosporins, and macrolides. overall, 26.7% of h. influenzae isolates were completely resistant to ampicillin. among the m. catarrhalis isolates, 30% were resistant to ampicillin. all the isolates of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis that were resistant to ampicillin were beta-lactamase producing strains. among the s. pneumoniae isolates, 33.3% isolates exhibited intermediate susceptibility  to penicillin g, and one isolate was completely resistant. all five isolates that were resistant to erythromycin expressed the m phenotype. s. pyogenes exhibited high susceptibility to all other antibiotics, except tetracycline. our study suggests that except for m. catarrhalis, all other bacterial isolates are susceptible to cephalosporins, macrolides, and fluroquinolones.

TI  == bacterial coinfections in lung tissue specimens from fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza a (h1n1) - united states, may-august 2009.
AB  == in previous influenza pandemics, studies of autopsy specimens have shown that most deaths attributed to influenza a virus infection occurred concurrently with  bacterial pneumonia, but such evidence has been lacking for 2009 pandemic influenza a (h1n1). to help determine the role of bacterial coinfection in the current influenza pandemic, cdc examined postmortem lung specimens from patients  with fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza a (h1n1) for bacterial causes of pneumonia. during may 1-august 20, 2009, medical examiners and local and state health departments submitted specimens to cdc from 77 u.s. patients with fatal cases of confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza a (h1n1). this report summarizes the demographic and clinical findings from these cases and the laboratory evaluation  of the specimens. evidence of concurrent bacterial infection was found in specimens from 22 (29%) of the 77 patients, including 10 caused by streptococcus  pneumoniae (pneumococcus). duration of illness was available for 17 of the 22 patients; median duration was 6 days (range: 1-25 days). fourteen of 18 patients  for whom information was available sought medical care while ill, and eight (44%) were hospitalized. these findings confirm that bacterial lung infections are occurring among patients with fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza a (h1n1) and underscore both the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for persons at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia and the need for early recognition of bacterial pneumonia in persons with influenza.

TI  == swine flu and antibiotics.
AB  == health services worldwide are likely to be hard-pressed by swine flu-related illness in the months ahead. secondary infections with streptococcus pneumoniae,  other streptococci (e.g. streptococcus pyogenes), haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus are likely to be important causes of morbidity and mortality. the uk department of health recently published clinical pathways for the management of swine flu. suggested severity criteria have not been validated  in respiratory infection and are different from those previously published. antibiotics are recommended for all patients assessed at hospital, regardless of  severity of illness; cephalosporins or quinolones are suggested for inpatients with pneumonia. these recommendations will jeopardize recent decreases in clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (cdad) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) in uk hospitals. this article, written on behalf of the bsac council, considers these recommendations and provides alternative antibiotic regimens for a range of clinical scenarios.

TI  == [drug susceptibility of bacteria isolated from pediatric respiratory infections at general practitioners' clinics to pediatric antibiotics].
AB  == four major causative bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae,  moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes) of pediatric respiratory infections, 295 clinical isolates in total, were isolated at general practitioners' clinics in sendai city, and evaluated the drug susceptibility to seven antibiotics for pediatric. penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae (prsp-pisp) were 55.8% of all s. pneumoniae isolates. the mic90 of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics in s. pneumoniae  were good, 0.5-1 microg/ml, however, macrolide-resistant strains remarkably increased. as for h. influenzae, 50.0% of all isolates were ampicillin-intermediate and -resistant (mic: > or = 2 microg/ml), the mic90s of cephalosporin antibiotics had large differences between 0.5 to 8 microg/ml, and generally less susceptibility was shown to other antibiotics. m. catarrhalis showed less susceptibility to amoxicillin which behaved unstably to penicillinase, on the other hand, the mic90s of other antibiotics were relatively good, 0.25-1 microg/ml. s. pyogenes remarkably tend to be resistant to macrolide  antibiotics, however, the mic90s of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics were very good, 0.03-0.06 microg/ml. pediatric respiratory infections are required a treatment which results in inhibition of drug-resistant bacteria. based on the results of drug susceptibility testing, we should make a proper selection of antibiotics by reference to disposition such as drug concentration in serum and transfer into cells.

TI  == sensitivity of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein in childhood bone and joint infections.
AB  == in addition to the examination of clinical signs, several laboratory markers have been measured for diagnostics and monitoring of pediatric septic bone and joint infections. traditionally erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) and leukocyte cell count have been used, whereas c-reactive protein (crp) has gained in popularity.  we monitored 265 children at ages 3 months to 15 years with culture-positive osteoarticular infections with a predetermined series of esr, crp, and leukocyte  count measurements. on admission, esr exceeded 20 mm/hour in 94% and crp exceeded 20 mg/l in 95% of the cases, the mean (+/- standard error of the mean) being 51 +/- 2 mm/hour and 87 +/- 4 mg/l, respectively. esr normalized in 24 days and crp  in 10 days. elevated crp gave a slightly better sensitivity in diagnostics than esr, but best sensitivity was gained with the combined use of esr and crp (98%).  elevated esr or crp was seen in all cases during the first 3 days. measuring esr  and crp on admission can help the clinician rule out an acute osteoarticular infection. crp normalizes faster than esr, providing a clear advantage in monitoring recovery. level of evidence: level ii, diagnostic study. see guidelines for authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  == new semiphysiological absorption model to assess the pharmacodynamic profile of cefuroxime axetil using nonparametric and parametric population pharmacokinetics.
AB  == cefuroxime axetil is widely used to treat respiratory tract infections. we are not aware of a population pharmacokinetic (pk) model for cefuroxime axetil. our objectives were to develop a semiphysiological population pk model and evaluate the pharmacodynamic profile for cefuroxime axetil. twenty-four healthy volunteers received 250 mg oral cefuroxime as a suspension after a standardized breakfast. liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used for drug analysis, nonmem and s-adapt (results reported) were used for parametric population pk modeling, and npag was used for nonparametric population pk modeling. monte carlo simulations were used to predict the duration for which the non-protein-bound-plasma concentration was above the mic (ft(>mic)). a model with one disposition compartment, a saturable and time-dependent drug release from the stomach, and fast drug absorption from the intestine yielded precise (r > 0.992)  and unbiased curve fits and an excellent predictive performance. the apparent clearance was 21.7 liters/h (19.8% coefficient of variation [cv]) and the volume  of distribution 38.7 liters (18.3% cv). robust (>or=90%) probabilities of target  attainment (ptas) were achieved by 250 mg cefuroxime given every 12 h (q12h) or q8h for mics of <or=0.375 mg/liter or <or=0.5 mg/liter, respectively, for the bacteriostasis target ft(>mic) of >or=40% and for mics of <or=0.094 mg/liter or <or=0.375 mg/liter, respectively, for the near-maximal-killing target ft(>mic) of >or=65%. for the >or=40% ft(>mic) target, the ptas for 250 mg cefuroxime q12h were >or=97.8% for streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae. cefuroxime at 250 mg q12h or q8h achieved ptas below 73% or 92%, respectively, for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and  penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae for susceptibility data from various countries. depending on the mic distribution, 250 mg oral cefuroxime q8h instead  of q12h should be considered, especially for more-severe infections that require  near-maximal killing by cefuroxime.

TI  == potential contribution by nontypable haemophilus influenzae in protracted and recurrent acute otitis media.
AB  == background: characterization of acute otitis media (aom) caused by nontypable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is important, particularly in view of the efforts to develop vaccines against nthi. to characterize nthi aom a large database of culture-positive aom cases was analyzed. methods: all culture-positive aom episodes (nthi, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes) in children <5 years old from 1999 through 2006, processed in our center were included. one isolate was counted per episode (< or  = 30 days). demographic and clinical data were retrieved from charts or by telephone interviews. multivariable regression analysis models were used. results: twelve thousand eight hundred twenty-three (8145 culture-positive) episodes were included. nthi was recovered in 4928 episodes; s. pneumoniae in 4399 episodes, m. catarrhalis in 499, and s. pyogenes in 447 episodes. independent risk factors for nthi aom (in culture-positive episodes) were: winter (odds ratio [or]: 1.2, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.05-1.33, p = 0.006); bilateral aom (or: 1.26, 95% ci: 1.12-1.42, p < 0.001); >3 previous aom episodes  (or: 1.27, 95% ci: 1.11-1.47, p = 0.001); and antibiotic consumption in previous  month (or: 1.3, 95% ci: 1.15-1.46, p < 0.001). ors for these variables remained significant when the analysis was conducted on single-pathogen aom only. for both nthi and s. pneumoniae, risk factors for mixed episodes were older age and bilateral aom. conclusion: nthi aom is characterized by higher occurrence in winter, bilaterality, recurrence, and previous antibiotic treatment compared with that caused by s. pneumoniae. these findings are in agreement with data associating nthi with protracted or recurrent morbidity. the finding that s. pneumoniae and nthi mixed episodes are more likely to occur in older children and in bilateral aom suggests that interaction between these 2 pathogens contributes  to chronicity or complexity of aom.

TI  == bacterial tracheitis: a multi-centre perspective.
AB  == the published literature on bacterial tracheitis is limited. we report the first  multi-centre study of bacterial tracheitis together with a concise review of the  literature. we conducted a retrospective study of cases admitted during the period 1993-2007 to 3 tertiary paediatric centres in the united kingdom and 1 in  australia. a total of 34 cases were identified. 31 patients (91%) required intubation. complications included cardiorespiratory arrest in 1, ards in 1, hypotension in 10, toxic shock syndrome in 1 and renal failure in 1 patient(s). staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly implicated bacterial organism, isolated from the respiratory tract in 55.8% of the cases overall. other pathogens commonly isolated from the respiratory tract included streptococcus pyogenes (5.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae (11.8%) and haemophilus influenzae (11.8%). viral coinfection was identified in 9 (31%) of the 29 cases in whom immunofluorescence testing was performed (influenza a in 4 cases; parainfluenza 1 in 2 cases; parainfluenza 3 in 2 cases; adenovirus in 1 case). the combined experience from 4 major paediatric intensive care units suggests that bacterial tracheitis remains a rare condition with an estimated incidence of approximately  0.1/100,000 children per year. short-term complications were common but long-term sequelae were rare. there were no fatal outcomes, which contrasts with the high historical mortality rates and likely reflects improvements in intensive care management.

TI  == genome dynamics in major bacterial pathogens.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria continuously encounter multiple forms of stress in their hostile environments, which leads to dna damage. with the new insight into biology offered by genome sequences, the elucidation of the gene content encoding proteins provides clues toward understanding the microbial lifestyle related to habitat and niche. campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogenic neisseria, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus are major human pathogens causing detrimental morbidity and mortality at a global scale. an algorithm for the clustering of orthologs was established in order to identify whether orthologs of selected genes were present or absent in the genomes of the  pathogenic bacteria under study. based on the known genes for the various functions and their orthologs in selected pathogenic bacteria, an overview of the presence of the different types of genes was created. in this context, we focus on selected processes enabling genome dynamics in these particular pathogens, namely dna repair, recombination and horizontal gene transfer. an understanding of the precise molecular functions of the enzymes participating in dna metabolism and their importance in the maintenance of bacterial genome integrity has also, in recent years, indicated a future role for these enzymes as targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  == the aim of this study was to explore the mechanism(s) by which oral cephalosporins penetrate into human oropharyngeal mucosa, and thus, the availability of sufficient concentrations at the site of infection. two oral cephalosporin prototypes, cephalexin (first generation) and cefixime (third generation), were administered to five healthy subjects at two different visits with a 1-week washout period. plasma and saliva samples were collected and drug concentrations were measured using an appropriate hplc method. the maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) of cefixime and cephalexin were 2.97+/-0.24 microg ml(-1) and 77.65+/-18.91 microg ml(-1), respectively. these concentrations were associated with a maximum salivary concentration (csmax) of 0.56 microg ml(-1) for cefixime and 3.34 microg ml(-1) for cephalexin. such levels exceed the reported minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. the average concentration of cefixime in saliva corresponded to its plasma free fraction (saliva/plasma [s/p] ratio; 0.34). however, this observation was not true for cephalexin, for which antibiotic concentrations in the saliva did not appear to correspond to its plasma free fraction (0.8-0.85), with an s/p ratio of only 0.092. our findings indicate that  an active transport mechanism exists for cefixime excretion into human oropharyngeal mucosa, whereas cephalexin is passively diffused, although to a limited extent, as measured by its salivary concentrations.

TI  == prospective, randomized trial of 10 days versus 30 days of antimicrobial treatment, including a short-term course of parenteral therapy, for childhood septic arthritis.
AB  == background: the standard treatment for septic arthritis in children is antimicrobials for several weeks (initially administered intravenously) and arthrotomy (at least for the hip and shoulder joints). no sufficiently powered study has examined the true need for these treatments. methods: in a randomized,  multicenter prospective trial in finland, children aged 3 months to 15 years who  had culture-positive septic arthritis were randomized to receive clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin for 10 days or 30 days (intravenously for the first 2-4 days). the number of surgical procedures was kept to a minimum. illness was monitored with preset criteria. antimicrobial therapy was discontinued when the clinical response was good and the c-reactive protein level decreased to 20 mg/l. the primary end point was full recovery without need for further administration of antimicrobial therapy because of an osteoarticular indication during the 12 months after therapy. results: of the total 130 cases, 88% were caused by staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus pyogenes; 63 patients were in the short-term treatment group, and 67 were in the  long-term treatment group. the median durations of antimicrobial treatment were 10 days and 30 days, respectively. surgical procedures that were more extensive than percutaneous joint aspiration were performed for 12% of patients, with no preponderance to hip or shoulder arthritis. two late-onset infections occurred in 1 child in the long-term treatment group; however, all patients recovered without sequelae. conclusions: large doses of well-absorbed antimicrobials for <2 weeks (initially administered intravenously) and only 1 joint aspiration are sufficient for treatment of most cases of childhood septic arthritis, regardless of the infecting pathogen or anatomical site, if the clinical response is good and the c-reactive protein level normalizes shortly after initiation of treatment.

TI  == epidemiologic and microbiologic characteristics of culture-positive spontaneous otorrhea in children with acute otitis media.
AB  == objectives: we aimed to describe the epidemiologic and microbiologic characteristics of acute otitis media (aom) with spontaneous otorrhea in children and compare it with aom with intact tympanic membrane in children who underwent tympanocentesis. patients and methods: all infants and young children aged <3 years with culture-positive aom of < or =7 days duration diagnosed during 1999 to 2006 and in whom epidemiologic and microbiologic data were available, were analyzed. streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes were considered true aom pathogens. multivariable regression analysis models adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, seasonality, previous antibiotics, aom history, tympanocentesis history, and pathogens isolated, were used. results: of 12,617 aom patients from whom a middle ear fluid was obtained, 5247 (42%) culture-positive patients were enrolled; spontaneous otorrhea was observed in 822 (15%) patients. patients with spontaneous otorrhea were older than patients with aom who underwent tympanocentesis (15.8 +/- 8.2 vs. 9.7 +/- 6.7 months, respectively, p < 0.01; 36.9% vs. 69.1%, respectively, were <12 months, p < 0.01). s. pyogenes was found  in a higher proportion (47/822, 5.7% vs. 44/4425, 1%, p < 0.01) and h. influenzae in a lower proportion (264/822, 32.1% vs. 1805/4425, 40.8%, p < 0.01) among patients with spontaneous otorrhea than in patients with aom and tympanocentesis. in the multivariate model, bedouin ethnicity (or: 1.5, 95% ci: 1.2-1.7, p < 0.001), age (or: 1.1, 95% ci: 1.0-1.11, p < 0.001) for each consecutive month, lack of antibiotic treatment for the 48 hours preceding diagnosis (or: 2.1, 95% ci: 1.7-2.6, p < 0.001), > or =1 previous aom episode (or: 3.2, 95% ci: 2.6-4.0,  p < 0.001), >1 previous tympanocentesis (or: 1.4, 95% ci: 1.4-1.7, p = 0.001), and infection with s. pyogenes (or: 8.2, 95% ci: 5.4-12.3, p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for aom presenting as spontaneous otorrhea. conclusions: aom presenting as spontaneous otorrhea in patients less than 3 years of age is characterized by older age, previous repeated tympanocenteses, > or =1 previous aom episodes, lack of recent antibiotic treatment, and infection with s. pyogene.

TI  == [correlation between antibiotic prescription and decreased antimicrobial resistance in the health area of zamora].
AB  == objective: to describe the trends in prescribing antibiotics and analyze a possible relationship with the evolution of antimicrobial sensitivity in respiratory pathogens isolated in the health area of zamora (spain). materials and methods: descriptive study investigating the prescription of antimicrobials and the evolution of resistance in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, from 1996 to 2005. antibiotic use is expressed in doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day (dhd). the chi(2) test, exact tests, spearman correlation coefficients, and a time series analysis were used to analyze the trends. results: a total of 1301 s. pyogenes strains were isolated. all were sensitive to penicillin, with decreasing percentages of resistance to erythromycin and increasing percentages of resistance to clindamycin. among 579 pneumococcal strains isolated, a significant decreasing resistance to penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic, cefotaxime and cefuroxime was observed; resistance to erythromycin and azithromycin increased during the first few years, but decreased later. among a total of 769 strains of h. influenzae, all were sensitive to cefotaxime and highly sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime; resistance to ampicillin was maintained and there was a significant decreasing resistance to azithromycin. simultaneously, there was a progressive decrease in overall antibiotic use (20.45 dhd in 1996; 18.90 dhd in 2005). prescription of penicillins remained stable, with increased use of amoxicillin-clavulanic, decreased use of cephalosporins and macrolides (except azithromycin), and increased use of fluorquinolones. we observed a significant correlation between prescription and resistance. conclusions: a recovery of sensitivity to antibiotics was seen in respiratory pathogens parallel to a progressive decrease  in prescription of antibiotics.

TI  == adherence of streptococcus pyogenes to human epithelial cells is modulated by haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pyogenes colonize overlapping regions of the nasopharynx and oropharynx. the effect of 10 h. influenzae strains (5 non-piliated parent strains and 5 piliated daughter strains) on adherence of s. pyogenes to human respiratory epithelial cells was assessed in this study. a 39.6% and 49.0% increase in the number of adherent s. pyogenes was observed in chang epithelial cells if the cells were already colonized with 2 out of 5 non-piliated strains of h. influenzae (p <0.05). four out of 5 piliated strains of h. influenzae enhanced the adherence of s. pyogenes to chang cells by 103.5%,  113.6%, 109.7% (p<0.01) and 53.4% (p<0.05). with a549 epithelial cells, non-piliated strains of h. influenzae did not affect the adherence of s. pyogenes (p>0.05), but a 36.9% (p<0.05), 62.9% (p<0.01) and 32.1% (p<0.05) increase in the number of adherent s. pyogenes was found with 3 out of 5 piliated strains of h. influenzae. these results indicate that increases of s. pyogenes adherence to epithelial cells may be modulated species-specifically by h. influenzae, especially by piliated h. influenzae.

TI  == activity of the new cephalosporin ceftaroline against bacteraemia isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == the activity of ceftaroline, a novel cephalosporin, was evaluated against 1337 isolates from patients with bacteraemic community-acquired pneumonia (cap) requiring hospitalisation (including 119 haemophilus influenzae, 9 moraxella catarrhalis, 164 staphylococcus aureus, 1007 streptococcus pneumoniae and 38 streptococcus pyogenes). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines, and susceptibility category assessments were made using clsi or us food and drug administration (fda) breakpoints. ceftaroline mics were < or  = 0.008-0.06 mg/l against h. influenzae, 0.25-2mg/l against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 0.06-1mg/l against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, 0.015-0.5mg/l against m. catarrhalis and < or = 0.008-0.5mg/l against s. pneumoniae, and all s. pyogenes isolates had ceftaroline mics < or = 0.008mg/l. ceftaroline was more active than ceftriaxone or cefepime both against mrsa and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. more than 90% of mrsa isolates were resistant to clarithromycin and levofloxacin but were susceptible to linezolid or tigecycline. a high rate of clarithromycin resistance was also observed in the pneumococci. ceftaroline was very active in vitro against all cap isolates, including mrsa and penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci, in contrast to the other beta-lactams tested. these data confirm ceftaroline as a new cephalosporin  with enhanced anti-gram-positive activity and suggest that ceftaroline has the potential to be a useful new agent in the treatment of cap-associated bacteraemic infections.

TI  == structural studies of the enterococcus faecalis sufu [fe-s] cluster protein.
AB  == background: iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous and evolutionarily ancient inorganic prosthetic groups, the biosynthesis of which depends on complex protein machineries. three distinct assembly systems involved in the maturation of cellular fe-s proteins have been determined, designated the nif, isc and suf systems. although well described in several organisms, these machineries are poorly understood in gram-positive bacteria. within the firmicutes phylum, the enterococcus spp. genus have recently assumed importance in clinical microbiology being considered as emerging pathogens for humans, wherein enterococcus faecalis  represents the major species associated with nosocomial infections. the aim of this study was to carry out a phylogenetic analysis in enterococcus faecalis v583 and a structural and conformational characterisation of it sufu protein. results: blast searches of the enterococcus genome revealed a series of genes with sequence similarity to the escherichia coli suf machinery of [fe-s] cluster biosynthesis, namely sufb, sufc, sufd and sufs. in addition, the e. coli iscu ortholog sufu was found to be the scaffold protein of enterococcus spp., containing all features considered essential for its biological activity, including conserved amino acid residues involved in substrate and/or co-factor binding (cys50,76,138 and asp52) and, phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship with orthologues from other gram-positive bacteria. molecular dynamics for structural determinations and molecular modeling using e. faecalis sufu primary sequence protein over the pdb:1su0 crystallographic model from streptococcus pyogenes were carried out with a subsequent 50 ns molecular dynamic trajectory. this presented a stable model, showing secondary structure modifications near the active site and conserved cysteine residues. molecular modeling using haemophilus influenzae iscu primary sequence over the pdb:1su0 crystal followed by a md trajectory was performed to analyse differences in the c-terminus region of gram-positive sufu and gram-negative orthologous proteins, in which several modifications in secondary structure were observed. conclusion:  the data describe the identification of the suf machinery for [fe-s] cluster biosynthesis present in the firmicutes genome, showing conserved sufb, sufc, sufd and sufs genes and the presence of the sufu gene coding for scaffold protein, instead of sufa; neither sufe nor sufr are present. primary sequences and structural analysis of the sufu protein demonstrated its structural-like pattern  to the scaffold protein iscu nearby on the isc machinery. e. faecalis sufu molecular modeling showed high flexibility over the active site regions, and demonstrated the existence of a specific region in firmicutes denoting the gram positive region (gpr), suggested as a possible candidate for interaction with other factors and/or regulators.

TI  == beta-lactam effects on mixed cultures of common respiratory isolates as an approach to treatment effects on nasopharyngeal bacterial population dynamics.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae are bacteria present in the nasopharynx as part of normal flora. the ecological equilibrium in the nasopharynx can be disrupted by the presence of antibiotics. methodology/principal findings: a computerized two-compartment pharmacodynamic model was used to explore beta-lactam effects on the evolution over time of a bacterial load containing common pharyngeal isolates by simulating free serum concentrations obtained with amoxicillin (amx) 875 mg tid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (amc) 875/125 mg tid and cefditoren (cdn) 400 mg bid  regimens over 24 h. strains and mics (microg/ml) of amx, amc and cdn were: s. pyogenes (0.03, 0.03 and 0.015), s. pneumoniae (2, 2 and 0.25), a beta-lactamase  positive h. influenzae (bl(+); >16, 2 and 0.06) and a beta-lactamase positive amc-resistant h. influenzae (blpacr, >16, 8 and 0.06). mixture of identical 1:1:1:1 volumes of each bacterial suspension were prepared yielding an inocula of approximately 4 x 10(6) cfu/ml. antibiotic concentrations were measured both in bacterial and in bacteria-free antibiotic simulations. beta-lactamase production  decreased amx concentrations and ft(>mic) against s. pneumoniae (from 43.2% to 17.7%) or s. pyogenes (from 99.9% to 24.9%), and eradication was precluded. the presence of clavulanic acid countered this effect of co-pathogenicity, and s. pyogenes (but not bl(+) and s. pneumoniae) was eradicated. resistance of cdn to tem beta-lactamase avoided this co-pathogenicity effect, and cdn eradicated s. pyogenes and h. influenzae strains (ft(>mic) >58%), and reduced in 94% s. pneumoniae counts (ft(>mic) approximately 25%). conclusions/significance: co-pathogenicity seems to be gradual since clavulanic acid countered this effect  for strains very susceptible to amx as s. pyogenes but not for strains with amx mic values in the limit of susceptibility as s. pneumoniae. there is a potential  therapeutic advantage for beta-lactamase resistant cephalosporins with high activity against streptococci.

AB  == in this study we evaluated the in vitro activities of cefditoren--a broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin--and other comparator agents against 2,396 fresh isolates from community-acquired respiratory tract infections, collected from 6 clinical italian microbiology laboratories. on penicillin-susceptible pneumococci and streptococcus pyogenes, cefditoren demonstrated to be the most active antibiotic (mic(90)values of 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l respectively), showing only a slight decrease in potency on penicillin-intermediate and resistant pneumococci (mic(90)value 0.5 mg/l, 1.0 mg/l respectively). all the other comparators displayed mic(90 )values of 4 - 8 mg/l for penicillins and of 4 to >64 mg/l for the oral cephalosporins. cefditoren and levofloxacin were the most active against mssa (mic(90)0.5 mg/ml). cefditoren displayed a uniformly potent inhibitory activity (mic(90)of 0.03 mg/l) against all strains of haemophilus influenzae, regardless of their ampicillin resistance (mediated or not by beta-lactamase production), while against moraxella catarrhalis mic(90)values were higher against beta-lactamase-positive (0.25 mg/l). cefditoren was active also against klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli : in this case its activity was comparable with that of levofloxacin. in conclusion, cefditoren, due to its potent activity, is a new effective therapeutic option for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == level of streptococcus pyogenes in patients with recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy.
AB  == recurrent tonsillitis is 1 of the common human infectious diseases worldwide, but, to date, its pathogenesis remains unclear. although streptococcus pyogenes (gas) is involved in recurrent bouts of acute tonsillitis, conventional cultures  usually fail to isolate it. the purpose of this study was to clarify whether the  deep tonsillar tissues of patients with recurrent tonsillitis might harbour gas,  resulting in reinfections. deep tonsillar tissues obtained from 285 patients with recurrent tonsillitis and 172 patients with tonsillar hypertrophy, who had undergone tonsillectomy, were examined for the presence of gas, using conventional and molecular methods. cultures from all patients were negative for  gas. gas dna was found in the deep tonsillar tissues of 57 out of 285 patients with recurrences (20%), and gas rna, indicating the viability of gas, was detected in 47 of them (82%). on the other hand, haemophilus influenzae dna was found in 15% and 16% of patients with recurrences and hypertrophy, respectively;  but no haemophilus influenzae rna presence was detected. the low level of presence of gas in patients with recurrent tonsillitis indicates that other unknown factors may be responsible for the recurrences.

TI  == effects of a low concentration hypochlorous acid nasal irrigation solution on bacteria, fungi, and virus.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: saline irrigation would be more effective for chronic sinusitis patients if it had bactericidal effects. low concentrations of hypochlorous acid may be used as a nasal irrigation solution. first, we developed a 0.85% nacl solution by adding nacl to tap water (ph 7.0 and 8.4) and measuring  the concentration of free chlorine and hypochlorous acid after giving the solution a short electrical impulse of 20 seconds. then we investigated whether the derived hypochlorous acid had a toxic effect on human primary nasal epithelial cells, if and what effect it had on the expression of mucin genes, and, finally, if it had bactericidal, fungicidal, or virucidal effects. study design: in vitro biochemical experiment. methods: we treated human primary nasal  epithelial cells with 3.5 ppm of hypochlorous acid and then examined the cells for cytotoxicity. we also investigated the bactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal effects by challenging the cells with the following microorganisms aspergillus fumigatus, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, rhizopus oryzae, candida albicans, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes. to study the virucidal effects of hocl, we used the human influenza a virus to challenge the cells. results: : in the cytotoxicity assay and in the morphological examination, the cells did not show anytoxicity at 30 minute or 2 hours after treatment with hocl. more than 99% of bactericidal or fungicidal activity was noted for all species, except for candida albicans, in tap water at either ph 7.0 or 8.4. in addition, a 3.2-log10 reduction was achieved in cells challenged with the human influenza a virus. conclusions: a low concentration hocl solution can be used as an effective nasal irrigation solution.

TI  == ["antibiotics only when necessary" campaign in the alpes-maritimes district: no negative impact on invasive infections in children in the community 1998-2003].
AB  == objectives: a multidisciplinary group (for the study and prevention of infections in children, gepie) conducted a local public health campaign to improve antibiotic prescribing in pediatric outpatient care in the alpes-maritimes district. this campaign included peer-conducted academic-detailing (educational outreach) visits in 2000 and 2003. practitioners often report during both focus groups and the gepie visits that they prescribe antibiotics because of a fear of  subsequent complications. this study therefore sought to explore the trends in invasive diseases related to bacterial respiratory pathogens. methods: a retrospective survey examined the incidence in the district of invasive infections due to streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, and neisseria meningitidis from 1998 through 2003 among children aged 1 month to 15 years. all local laboratories were asked for all reports of blood cultures (as well as spinal, synovial, pericardiac, peritoneal, and pleural fluid cultures) positive for these bacteria in the study population over the study period. resistance and serotype data were recorded. results: over the 6-year study period, there were 113 cases of invasive infections: 64% due to s. pneumoniae, 26% to n. meningitidis, 6% to h. influenzae, and 4% to s. pyogenes. there was no statistically significant difference in the annual average incidence rate before and during the campaign. the overall incidence rate was 11.2 cases per 100,000; meningitis accounted for 4.2, and invasive pneumococcal diseases 7.2 (42.7 per 100,000 children younger than 2 years). pneumococcal resistance rates to penicillin and erythromycin did not change significantly. discussion: two local cross-sectional studies at daycare centers in 1999 and 2002 showed a 9% reduction in the proportion of children who received antibiotics. the stability of invasive infection in children and of bacterial resistance during the campaign is reassuring. the campaign's risk/benefit ratio appears positive. conclusion: these results encourage continuing promotion of rational antibiotic prescribing and ought to allay practitioners' fears about the consequences of prescribing antibiotics less often.

TI  == [colonization (infection) of the respiratory tract in outpatients in 2000-2005 years].
AB  == infections of the respiratory tract are one of the main causes of family doctor visiting. a variety of etiological factors (mostly viruses, typical and non typical bacteria) causes that the diagnosis of these infections is rarely made in outpatient practice (usually these are nose and throat smears); additionally the  carrier state of typical bacteria in the respiratory tract impedes the interpretation of microbiological results. the aim of the study was to assess the incidence of potential bacterial etiological factors of respiratory tract infections in outpatients in the years 2000-2005. material and methods: the 3270  microbiological results obtained from patients at the age of between 1 month and  88 years old with chronic and acute symptoms of respiratory tract infections were analyzed. results: the positive results of bacteria culture indicating the possible bacterial etiological agent of infection were found from 1051 patients (34.4%), mostly in autumn - spring time. most often were isolated: h. influenzae  - 28.8%, s. pneumoniae - 22.1% and s. aureus - 22.1%, in less percentage m. catarrhalis - 14.1% and s. pyogenes - 13.1. positive bacteria cultures were received most often from ear secretion- 66.8% (p. aeruginosa, s. aureus), from nose-41.2% (s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae), sputum - 34.9% (s. aureus), throat - 24.3% (h. influenzae, s. pyogenes). conclusions: it has been confirmed that predominant participation of viruses in respiratory system infections is observed and also seasonal character of their bacterial nature occurrence (35%). most often were isolated: h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, also m. catarrhalis. on the ground of carrier state of these bacteria in nasopharynx it is a clinician's decision to recognize the bacteria as the etiological agent of infection and possible use of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens in japan during protekt years 1-5 (1999-2004).
AB  == susceptibility to a range of antimicrobial agents was determined among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and haemophilus influenzae collected in 12 centers throughout japan during years 1-5 (the respiratory seasons of 1999-2004) of the longitudinal prospective resistant organism tracking and epidemiology for the ketolide telithromycin study. the most frequent source of isolates of s. pneumoniae was from patients with community-acquired pneumonia  (cap) (25.3%). reduced susceptibility to penicillin or erythromycin resistance was common among s. pneumoniae isolates (30.9-44.5% and 77.2-81.9%, respectively). the macrolide mic(50) for s. pneumoniae was >or=128 microg/ml (azithromycin and erythromycin) and >or=64 microg/ml (clarithromycin). the erm(b) genotype accounted for the most erythromycin-resistant isolates in each study year. h. influenzae isolates were most commonly derived from patients with cap (26.2%). the proportion of h. influenzae isolates that were beta-lactamase positive ranged between 4.3% and 9.7%. the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative  ampicillin-resistant isolates increased from 0.4% to 2.6% between years 1 and 4 then to 19.7% in year 5. s. pyogenes isolates were highly susceptible to most antimicrobial agents except macrolides and tetracycline. telithromycin was highly active against all three pathogens examined throughout the study.

TI  == baseline in vitro activity of tigecycline among key bacterial pathogens exhibiting multidrug resistance.
AB  == tigecycline is the first clinically available semisynthetic glycylcycline approved for clinical use. this study was done to establish a baseline for ongoing surveillance of tigecycline's activity as this agent's clinical use increases. against 1,796 staphylococcus aureus (559 multidrug resistant), tigecycline had the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration (mic(90); 0.12 microg/ml) among all agents tested and 99.8% of the isolates were susceptible. for acinetobacter spp., tigecycline again demonstrated the lowest mic(90) (2 microg/ml) and the highest percent susceptibility (96.9%). among enterobacteriaceae, the 2 most active agents were tigecycline (mic(90) = 1 microg/ml; 99% susceptible) and imipenem (mic(90) = 1 microg/ml; 99.5% susceptible). tigecycline also demonstrated high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes,haemophilus influenzae and enterococcus spp. in summary, tigecycline currently exhibits potent activity against a broad array  of bacteria species. given the dynamics of resistance development, careful monitoring of tigecycline activity against these organisms should remain a significant aspect of ongoing surveillance.

TI  == seasonal distribution of otitis media pathogens among costa rican children.
AB  == background: otitis media is an important cause of pediatric consultation, and knowledge of yearly pathogen distribution might improve antimicrobial selection.  objectives: to determine the seasonal pathogen and antimicrobial resistance distribution among costa rican children with otitis media. methods: between 1999  and 2004, 952 children with otitis media, aged 3-144 months who participated in various clinical trials, were analyzed. data obtained from this period were compared against historical data collected between 1992 and 1997. results: five hundred sixteen (52%) children had a baseline middle ear fluid pathogen isolated. the most common pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae 252 (49%), haemophilus influenzae 190 (37%), s. pyogenes 38 (7%), and moraxella catarrhalis 36 (7%). the overall proportion of h. influenzae (24-37%; p = 0.01) and the production of beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae (2.6-7%; p = 0.02) increased from 1992-1997 to 1999-2004. there was a nonstatistically significant trend for a higher frequency of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae isolates detected during the  rainy season than during the dry season: s. pneumoniae 58% versus 42% but not significant (p = 0.1) and h. influenzae 68% versus 32% (p = 0.06), respectively.  during the rainy season, penicillin-nonsusceptible s. pneumoniae was identified more frequently (38.5%) than during the dry season (18%) (p = 0.003; odds ratio:  2.94; 95% confidence interval: 1.4-6.45). penicillin-nonsusceptible s. pneumoniae decreased from 46.5% (1999-2001) to 16% (2002-2003) and this was associated with  a significant decline of a circulating 19f penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae serotype (from 89% to 26%), respectively. conclusions: s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae are the 2 most common pathogens producing otitis media in costa rican  children. an increase in the number of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis was observed in recent years. penicillin-nonsusceptible s. pneumoniae isolates were more commonly observed during the rainy season, in which increased morbidity with respiratory pathogens is observed.

TI  == a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot hybridization (mpcr/rlb) assay for detection of bacterial respiratory pathogens in children with pneumonia.
AB  == objectives: to develop and evaluate a novel method for simultaneous identification of 12 potential bacterial pathogens in children with community-acquired pneumonia. methods: a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay was developed, to identify 12 respiratory bacterial pathogens, namely staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus influenzae type b, bordetella pertussis, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and single (uniplex) pcrs were used for s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae only. in a preliminary evaluation, we compared the results of mpcr/rlb with those of single  (uniplex) pcrs and culture of nasopharyngeal aspirates (npas) from 100 children under 5 years, admitted to beijing children's hospital between october 2004 and may 2005, with pneumonia. results: reference strains and clinical isolates of all 12 target species were correctly identified by mpcr/rlb. potential pathogens were isolated from one blood culture and 26% of respiratory cultures. one or more pathogens were identified in 70% of respiratory specimens--by mpcr/rlb in 63%, upcr only in another 3%, culture only in 2%, and culture plus upcr in 2%. the species most commonly identified were s. pneumoniae (54%) and h. influenzae (38%, including type b, 4%). cultures were not performed for b. pertussis, m. tuberculosis, c. pneumoniae or m. pneumoniae but each was identified by mpcr/rlb  in between one and four specimens. two or more potential pathogens were identified in 35% of specimens. ten of 14 s. pneumoniae isolates belonged to serotypes represented in the 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. conclusions: the mpcr/rlb assay is a sensitive tool for identification of respiratory pathogens, including mixed infections and bacteria requiring special  culture methods.

TI  == pediatric mastoiditis in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era: symptom duration guides empiric antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == background: the microbiology of acute otitis media has changed in the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv) era. we hypothesize similar changes with pediatric mastoiditis. objectives: to compare the etiology of mastoiditis in the  pre-pcv (january 1995-december 2000) and post-pcv (january 2001- april 2005) eras to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy in the pediatric emergency department. methods: retrospective chart review of all patients admitted with a diagnosis of  mastoiditis from january 1995 to april 2005. results: : one hundred twenty-two charts were reviewed, 68 pre-pcv and 54 post-pcv. etiological agents were determined by culture results in 60 patients. the most common bacterial isolates  were streptococcus pneumoniae (24), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), staphylococcus aureus (12), streptococcus pyogenes (8), and haemophilus influenzae (2). there was no reduction in mastoiditis due to s. pneumoniae from the pre-pcv to the post-pcv eras (odds ratio [or], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.4-2.1; p = 0.77). ceftriaxone nonsusceptibility was seen in 30% of post-pcv s. pneumoniae isolates compared with 7% of pre-pcv isolates. acute mastoiditis was diagnosed in 93 patients, and chronic mastoiditis (defined as >or=3 wk of symptoms) was diagnosed in 29 patients. streptococcus pneumoniae was more likely to be implicated in acute versus chronic mastoiditis (or, 9.2; 95% ci, 1.2-52.2; p = 0.01). pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently implicated in chronic versus acute mastoiditis (or, 16.4; 95% ci, 2.1-75.8; p = 0.0003). conclusions: there was no difference in the proportion of pediatric mastoiditis cases caused by s. pneumoniae in the pre-pcv versus post-pcv eras. empiric antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone alone is not sufficient in the post-pcv era.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel propolis formulation (actichelated propolis).
AB  == aims: this study compared in vitro activities of actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. methods and results: minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater  potency of actichelated propolis (mic range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (mic range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). concentrations of actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. preincubation of strep. pyogenes and h. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x mic) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. conclusions: actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells.  significance and impact of the study: this new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.

TI  == bacteriologic comparison of tonsil core in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy.
AB  == objectives: although many bacteriology studies on tonsillar diseases have been completed, all have been confined to children and were characterized by a paucity of cases. the purpose of this study was to analyze the underlying bacterial pathogens in tonsillar disease. methods: a retrospective study was performed on 824 patients who underwent elective tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy.  we analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy with regard to age, season, and antibiotic  sensitivity. results: among 824 cases, 966 bacterial strains from the tonsil core were isolated. in recurrent tonsillitis, staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (30.3%), followed by haemophilus influenzae (15.5%) and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (streptococcus pyogenes, 14.4%). in patients over 14 years of age, quite differently from other age groups, klebsiella pneumoniae was  isolated at a significantly higher percentage. in tonsillar hypertrophy, h. influenzae was isolated most commonly (31.4%) regardless of age, followed by s. pyogenes (24.2%), s. aureus (22.9%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (12.6%). furthermore, mixed infection was common because of its high resistance to penicillin. in both groups, s. pneumoniae was more common in younger patients, whereas k. pneumoniae was relatively common in adults. we found no differences in the detection rate by season; however, h. influenzae was frequently isolated in the tonsillar hypertrophy group regardless of seasonal variations. we also found  no difference in the antibiotic sensitivity between the two groups; however, strains resistant to penicillin were relatively prevalent and showed a high sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporin. conclusions: we observed some differences in the types of bacteria in the tonsillar core between the recurrent  tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy groups. our study indicates that essential  bacteria have been changing and, thus, we need to change our choice of antibiotics.

TI  == crystal structure of cefditoren complexed with streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein 2x: structural basis for its high antimicrobial activity.
AB  == cefditoren is the active form of cefditoren pivoxil, an oral cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections and otitis media caused by bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus. beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefditoren, target penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), which are membrane-associated enzymes that play essential roles in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic process. to envision the binding of cefditoren to pbps, we determined the crystal structure of a trypsin-digested form of pbp 2x from s. pneumoniae strain r6 complexed with cefditoren. there are two pbp 2x molecules (designated molecules 1 and 2) per asymmetric unit. the structure reveals that the orientation of trp374 in each molecule changes in a different way upon the formation of the complex, but each forms a hydrophobic pocket. the methylthiazole group of the c-3 side chain of cefditoren fits into this binding pocket, which consists of residues his394, trp374, and thr526 in molecule 1 and residues his394, asp375, and thr526 in molecule 2. the formation of the complex is also accompanied by an induced-fit conformational change of the enzyme in the  pocket to which the c-7 side chain of cefditoren binds. these features likely play a role in the high level of activity of cefditoren against s. pneumoniae.

TI  == usefulness of immunohistochemical diagnosis of streptococcus pneumoniae in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens compared with culture and gram stain  techniques.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent cause of pneumonia and meningitis.  because s pneumoniae can colonize the upper respiratory tract and antibiotic treatment may inhibit growth, culture-based diagnosis can be problematic. an immunohistochemical assay using a polyclonal antibody against pneumococci was used to test formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 46 patients for whom bacterial culture results were available. samples from 26 patients demonstrated pneumococcal antigens in areas of pneumonia, meningitis, or osteomyelitis or within circulating inflammatory cells. various specimens from 18 patients grew s pneumoniae, whereas 8 had cultures that grew mixed bacteria or had no growth but were polymerase chain reaction-positive for the s pneumoniae ity a gene. pneumococcal antigens were not present in 20 cases (7 grew streptococcus pyogenes; 9, staphylococcus aureus; and 4, haemophilus influenzae). compared with culture, the immunohistochemical assay showed 100% sensitivity and  71% specificity. immunohistochemical analysis has the diagnostic advantage of correlating host inflammatory reaction with presence of pneumococci.

TI  == resistance patterns of selected respiratory tract pathogens in poland.
AB  == this study presents the results of a survey of the in-vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of major pathogens responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections in poland during 2002-2004. the collection of 1184 bacterial isolates comprised 398 streptococcus pneumoniae, 344 haemophilus influenzae, 302 streptococcus pyogenes and 140 moraxella catarrhalis. among the pneumococcal isolates, 16.8% were penicillin-non-susceptible (pnsp), of which 80.6% were identified as multidrug-resistant. overall, 9.0% of h. influenzae isolates were beta-lactamase-positive, although this percentage increased noticeably in the third year of the study. based on pcr results, 12.8% of h. influenzae isolates were identified as low-level beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (blnar), and one isolate as low-level beta-lactamase-positive, amoxycillin-clavulanic acid-resistant (blpacr). pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) classified 45 h. influenzae isolates with altered penicillin-binding proteins into 15 pfge types, including two predominant types (with four and six sub-types) containing 15 and ten isolates, respectively. resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin and clindamycin was found in 20.9%, 8.9% and 4.6% of s. pyogenes isolates, respectively. the production of beta-lactamase  characterised 91.4% of m. catarrhalis isolates. in summary, the overall occurrence of pnsp in poland remains stable, although there was a noticeable increase in the proportion of fully-resistant isolates. a rising trend in the prevalence of beta-lactamase producers and low-level blnar isolates was observed  among polish isolates of h. influenzae.

TI  == [in vitro study to evaluate the antibacterial activity of a combination of the haulm of nasturtium (tropaeoli majoris herba) and of the roots of horseradish (armoraciae rusticanae radix)].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in-vitro antimicrobial properties of a commercialized  preparation (angocin anti-infekt n) containing a combination of the haulm of nasturtium (tropaeoli majoris herba; n) and of the roots of horseradish (armoraciae rusticanae radix; h). this preparation can be used to treat upper respiratory tract (urti) and urinary tract infections (uti). the active ingredients are volatile mustard oils, which are activated in the gastrointestinal tract after oral intake. previous research has shown mustard oils derived from either n or h to possess antibacterial activity. methods: in order to assess the antimicrobial capacity of phytotherapeutic compounds containing volatile mustard oils, a modified gas-test was used. native preparations of n and h were applied to the lids of columbia agar plates (ratio n:h = 2.5:1) and mixed with sterile h20. thirteen different bacterial species including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa, mrsa) were tested (20 isolates each). the  test organisms were plated onto the blood agar plates and placed above the native preparations. the plates were sealed with adhesive tape and incubated at 37 degrees c. following incubation of 24 h and 92 h, colony forming units (cfu) were counted and the minimal inhibitory concentrationg (mic90) was determined for each bacterial species. results: relevant antimicrobial activities of the combined native preparations were found against h. influenzae (mic90 50 mg n / 20 mg h), m. catarrhalis (100 mg n / 40 mg h), e. coli (400 mg n / 160 mg h), p aeruginosa  (400 mg n / 160 mg h), mssa (400 mg n 1 160 mg h), mrsa (400 mg n / 160 mg h), and s. pyogenes (400 mg n / 160 mg h). conclusion: antimicrobial testing of a combination of n and h revealed broad antibacterial activities against clinically relevant pathogens covering both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, thus  confirming previous reports of the antibacterial properties of mustard oils. additionally, this study demonstrated that the combination of n and h leads to synergistic activity in terms of improved pseudomonas-susceptibility compared to  the previous reported activities of the single compounds. thus, these results prove that there is a rational basis for treatment of urti and uti with a combination of n and h.

TI  == macrolide resistance rates in respiratory pathogens in slovenia following reduced macrolide use.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the association between decreased use of macrolides and resistance of common respiratory pathogens in slovenia from 1999 to 2004. over a 6-year period the consumption of macrolides in slovenia decreased by 21.3%, from 3.81 defined daily doses/1000 inhabitants per day (did) to 3.0 did. the use of short-acting, intermediate-acting and long-acting subclasses of macrolides decreased by 50%, 18% and 13%, respectively. in the same period, resistance of invasive strains of streptococcus pneumoniae increased from 4.6% to 11.1% and resistance of non-invasive strains of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes increased from 12.8% to 20.2% and from 7.4% to 12.5%, respectively. resistance increased significantly more in children than in adults (p=0.05) and was significantly correlated with increased use of intermediate-acting macrolides (r=0.94 for non-invasive s. pneumoniae and r=0.96 for s. pyogenes) in children. resistance of haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis was low and did not change. in children and adults, the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains of invasive s. pneumoniae was observed. the decline in total macrolide use was not paralleled by reduced macrolide resistance rates of s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae during the 6-year period. there was a strong correlation between the use of intermediate-acting macrolides and macrolide resistance of s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae in children. further reduction in the use of intermediate- and long-acting macrolides should be encouraged.

TI  == how long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? a systematic review.
AB  == background: inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. methods: the literature was systematically reviewed in medline without language restrictions. in addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard  textbooks on the topic were reviewed. all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were  included. results: most gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. (including vre), staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), or streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. many gram-negative species, such as acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, or shigella spp., can also survive for months. a few others, such as bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, proteus vulgaris, or vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. mycobacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. persistence of other yeasts, such as torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (candida parapsilosis, 14 days). most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, sars or rhino virus, can persist on  surfaces for a few days. viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, hav, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. blood-borne viruses, such as hbv or hiv, can persist for more than one week. herpes viruses, such as cmv or hsv type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from  only a few hours up to 7 days. conclusion: the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.

AB  == the objective of the study was to compare the proportions of the recovery of pathogens of acute maxillary sinusitis in adults in the 4-year period prior to the 5-year period that followed the introduction of vaccination of children with  the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (pcv7). cultures were obtained through endoscopy from 385 adults with acute maxillary sinusitis, 156 between 1997 and 2000, and 229 between 2001 and 2005. one hundred and seventeen potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from the cultures obtained between 1997 and 2000. the predominant organisms were streptococcus pneumoniae (54 or 46 % of all  isolates), haemophilus influenzae non-type b (42 or 36 %), moraxella catarrhalis  (7 or 6 %), streptococcus pyogenes (8 or 7 %) and staphylococcus aureus (6 or 5 %). one hundred and sixty-seven potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from the cultures obtained between 2001 and 2005. the most predominant organisms  were h. influenzae non-type b (71 or 43 % of all isolates), strep. pneumoniae (58 or 35 %), m. catarrhalis (13 or 8 %), strep. pyogenes (12 or 7 %) and staph. aureus (13 or 8 %). significant statistical differences were noted in the rates of recovery of h. influenzae non-type b (p < 0.05) and strep. pneumoniae (p < 0.05). a decrease occurred in the recovery of strep. pneumoniae resistant to penicillin from 41 to 29 %, and an increase was noted in the isolation of beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae from 33 to 39 %; however, neither change was statistically significant. these data illustrate that a significant shift occurred in the causative pathogens of acute maxillary sinusitis in adults in the 5 years after the introduction of vaccination of children with the pcv7 compared  to the previous 4 years.

TI  == antibacterial activity of propolis and its active principles alone and in combination with macrolides, beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones against microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  == propolis is produced by bees and is reported to have several pharmaceutical properties. its antibacterial activity against strains causing upper respiratory  tract infections is particularly important: propolis might be used as a therapeutic agent to prevent the bacterial infections that sometimes overlap viral infections. in this study the in vitro activity of both an alcoholic solution and a hydroglyceric extract of propolis, as well as its active principles, was tested against bacteria responsible for respiratory infections (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes). we also evaluated the in vitro activity of a combination of propolis and its active principles and some beta-lactams, macrolides and fluoroquinolones. our results, though not demonstrating a clearly synergistic activity between antibiotics and propolis and its constituents, show the possibility of using natural preparations, due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, to enhance antibacterial therapy.

TI  == otomicroscopic findings and systemic interleukin-6 levels in relation to etiologic agent during experimental acute otitis media.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to explore whether it was possible to differentiate the clinical course and the otomicroscopic appearance of acute otitis media (aom) caused by common otitis pathogens in an animal model. systemic interleukin (il)-6 levels as early markers for bacterial aom were also studied. four groups of rats were inoculated with either streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, non-typeable haemophilus influenzae or moraxella catarrhalis. the animals were monitored by otomicroscopy, photos of the tympanic  membrane, cultures and il-6 detection in serum the following 4 days. the gram-positive s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes induced severe aom with opaque effusion behind the tympanic membrane, pronounced dilation of the vessels and spontaneous perforations. the gram-negative h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis induced a less severe infection with cloudy, sometimes foamy effusion, and no spontaneous perforations. with the otomicroscopic findings it was possible to distinguish between infections induced by gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. detection of interleukin-6 in serum appeared to be of limited use for all infections except the pneumococcal aom, but this needs to be  further investigated.

AB  == objective: to obtain the main responsible organisms, its sensitivity and resistances to antibiotics in tonsillitis. material and methods: we have studied  the post-surgical tonsils, carrying out a microbiologic study, its culture and sensitivity. results: the most frequent isolated organisms were staphylococcus aureus (29.3%), followed by streptococcus pyogenes (23.4%), and haemophilus influenzae (12.1%). the highest resistances were for the s. aureus (penicillin 91%, erythromycin 18% and 5% to the rest of the beta-lactams), followed by h. influenzae (50% clarithromycin, 30% amoxyciilin and 2% cephalosporins) and s. pyogenes (28% erytromycin, 10% clindamycin and 3% penicillin). conclusions: we noticed the minimal resistance found to cephalosporins, and for this reason they  appear to be the safest option, except in children under five years old, in which amoxicillin is still the first line treatment, because the causative agent is s.  pyogenes, sensitive to that antibiotic.

TI  == optimal site for throat culture: tonsillar surface versus posterior pharyngeal wall.
AB  == to determine the optimal site of throat culture for the detection of potential pathogens by comparing culture results from the tonsillar surface and the posterior pharyngeal wall in children selected for adenotonsillectomy and in children without upper respiratory disease. cotton culture swabs were taken from  the tonsillar surface and the posterior pharyngeal wall of 50 children selected for adenotonsillectomy for symptoms of recurrent tonsillitis and/or adenotonsillar hypertrophy and of 50 children without upper respiratory disease.  potential respiratory pathogens were identified. in the overall group (n = 100),  positive culture results were found in 67 posterior pharyngeal wall samples and 47 tonsillar surface samples (p = 0.001). haemophilus influenzae was the most frequently isolated micro-organism both in the posterior pharyngeal wall and the  tonsillar surface samples; 55 and 35%, respectively (p = 0.001). group a beta-haemolytic streptococci were found in the samples of the posterior pharyngeal wall and the tonsillar surface in 17 and 13%, respectively (p = 0.2).  when dealing with patients with sore throat, sampling both tonsillar surfaces is  enough for the detection of group a beta-haemolytic streptococci. when detection  of other bacteria is also important, such as for research purposes, the posterior pharyngeal wall should be sampled as well.

TI  == antibiotic consumption and generation of resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae:  the paradoxical impact of quinolones in a complex selective landscape.
AB  == the development of resistance to the different antibiotics by the majority of bacterial species of clinical importance seems unavoidable. however, not all drugs have the same efficiency to select for resistance. large differences in the qualitative and quantitative consumption of antibiotics among countries are known to exist and several authors have consistently reported the direct relationship between consumption and selection of resistance for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli and beta-lactams and macrolides use. in spain, extensive surveillance started in 1996, and the willow (sauce) project, to monitor and update resistance in respiratory pathogens and to couple those data with data concerning national antibiotic consumption (ims) from both a temporal and geographical approach. temporally, despite a continuous increase of 16% in quinolone consumption from 1997 to 2001, basically due to the arrival of respiratory quinolones, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, a continuous linear increase in the resistance rates to ciprofloxacin in s. pneumoniae was not observed. there also was an inverse correlation between provincial consumption of quinolones and resistance to ciprofloxacin. several hypotheses are proposed and discussed to explain these  apparent paradoxical observations, such as the replacement of ciprofloxacin by more potent antipneumococcal quinolones, the possibility of an antibiotic pressure threshold, the influence of other nonquinolone drugs on the expression of ciprofloxacin-resistance biological costs, and the influence of changes in temporal or spatial prevalence of particular clones.

TI  == study of upper respiratory tract bacterial flora: first report. variations in upper respiratory tract bacterial flora in patients with acute upper respiratory  tract infection and healthy subjects and variations by subject age.
AB  == with the appearance of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, there has been increasing debate concerning antimicrobial treatments for acute upper respiratory tract infection (aurti) and acute otitis media in children. this study compares the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in patients with aurti (aurti group; 710 subjects) and healthy subjects (hs group; 380 subjects). the comparisons were made between subjects aged 6 years or younger (0-6 subgroup: 330 subjects), between 7 and 74 years (7-74 subgroup: 668 subjects), and 75 years and older (92 subjects), because the subjects were subgrouped as described above dependent on the maturity of the protective immunity. in the hs group 7-74 subgroup, viridans group streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative  staphylococci, and corynebacterium sp. with a detection rate of 10% or more were  classified as normal nasal flora (nnf), and streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis were classified as  drum cavity pathogens (dcp). in the 0-6 subgroup, although the detection rate for dcp bacteria in the aurti group tended to be high, it did not reach a significant difference, whereas the detection rate for nnf bacteria was significantly lower.  this trend was also observed to some degree in the other age subgroup. in the 0-6 subgroup, leukocyte infiltration observed with a microscope indicated the closest relationship between s. pneumoniae detection rate and detection quantity. these results suggest that in the 0-6 subgroup the tendency for patients with aurti to  have nnf bacteria as well as dcp bacteria should be taken into consideration.

AB  == objective: to explore the efficacy of the ketolide telithromycin compared with azithromycin in eradicating s pneumoniae from the nasopharynx of adults with acute maxillary sinusitis. the growing resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae to  penicillin and macrolides brought about the development of a new class of antibiotics-the ketolides-that are effective against resistant pneumococci. setting: otolaryngology clinic. patients: one-hundred five patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. interventions: nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained before  therapy and 10 to 12 days after initiation of treatment. fifty-nine patients were treated with 500 mg of azithromycin daily for 3 days and 46 were treated with 800 mg of telithromycin daily for 5 days. results: sixty-seven potential pathogens were recovered prior to initiation of therapy in 57 patients, 32 treated with telithromycin and 25 treated with azithromycin: s pneumoniae (31 isolates), haemophilus influenzae (non-type b) (13), staphylococcus aureus (8), streptococcus pyogenes (8), and moraxella catarrhalis (7). the distribution of the pathogens was similar in both groups. the number of s pneumoniae isolates in  the azithromycin group was reduced following treatment from 14 to 8 (43% reduction), and 5 of these 8 isolates were resistant to azithromycin. in contrast, the number of s pneumoniae isolates in the telithromycin group was reduced following treatment from 17 to 1 (94% reduction) (p < .01). this isolate  was susceptible to azithromycin and telithromycin. no differences were noted in the eradication rate of all of the other potential pathogens, which were all susceptible to both azithromycin and telithromycin. development of resistance to  the antimicrobial agents used (defined as increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration by at least 2 tubes) was found only in 5 isolates (4 s pneumoniae and 1 h influenzae) recovered only from patients who received azithromycin (p < .05). conclusion: these data illustrate the superiority of telithromycin to azithromycin in the eradication of s pneumoniae from the nasopharynx.

TI  == simultaneous detection of pathogens in clinical samples from patients with community-acquired pneumonia by real-time pcr with pathogen-specific molecular beacon probes.
AB  == in this study, real-time pcr with pathogen-specific molecular beacons (mb) and primers was evaluated for prediction of community-acquired pneumonia (cap) causative agents, detecting six main cap agents, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, and streptococcus pyogenes, simultaneously. the pcr assay was evaluated for fresh clinical specimens from infants and children (n = 389) and from adults (n = 40). the mb probes and primers are both pathogen specific, namely, the lyta gene for s. pneumoniae, the mip gene for l. pneumophila, and 16s rrna genes for the remaining four organisms. dna extraction of clinical specimens was performed with a commercially available extragen ii kit, and amplification was performed with stratagene mx3000p. the limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 2 copies to 18 copies. the whole process from dna extraction to the analysis was finished in less than 2 h. the obtained sensitivity and specificity  of this real-time pcr study relative to those of conventional cultures were as follows: 96.2% and 93.2% for s. pneumoniae, 95.8% and 95.4% for h. influenzae, 100% and 100% for s. pyogenes, and 100% and 95.4% for m. pneumoniae, respectively. the sensitivity and specificity for m. pneumoniae relative to those of a serologic assay were 90.2% and 97.9%, respectively. in six clinical samples  of c. pneumoniae, the real-time pcr gave positive predictable values, and in those cases, elevation of the titer value was also observed. in conclusion, we demonstrated that a real-time pcr assay with pathogen-specific mb is useful in identifying cap causative agents rapidly and in examining the clinical course of  empirical chemotherapy in a timely manner, supporting conventional culture methods.

TI  == penicillin resistance is not extrapolable to amoxicillin resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from middle ear fluid in children with acute otitis media.
AB  == objectives: we evaluated the in vitro antibacterial activity of amoxicillin against penicillin-susceptible and -nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from children with acute otitis media (aom). methods: children more than 3 months of age with aom who were seen in the dr sotero del rio and luis calvo mackenna hospitals in santiago, chile, between july 1998 and december  2002 were subjected to tympanic puncture for middle ear fluid culture. the penicillin and amoxicillin susceptibilities of the s pneumoniae isolates were determined by epsilometer test (e test). results: a bacterial pathogen was isolated in 432 of 543 children (80%) as follows: s pneumoniae, 40%; haemophilus  influenzae, 29%; moraxella catarrhalis, 7%; and streptococcus pyogenes, 4%. penicillin-susceptible s pneumoniae strains were less common than amoxicillin-susceptible strains (60% versus 95%; odds ratio [or], 0.08; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.04 to 0.18). both intermediate- and high-resistance strains were more common for penicillin (22% versus 4.5%; or, 5.6; 95% ci, 2.5 to 12.7) than for amoxicillin (18% versus 0.5%; or, 41.3; 95% ci, 6.0 to 821). conclusions: penicillin resistance is not extrapolable to amoxicillin among s pneumoniae strains isolated from middle ear fluid of children with aom. our results support the recommendation to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin-nonsusceptible s pneumoniae for amoxicillin and to continue use of this antimicrobial as a first-line antimicrobial choice for children with aom.

TI  == the viriato study: update of antimicrobial susceptibility data of bacterial pathogens from community-acquired respiratory tract infections in portugal in 2003 and 2004.
AB  == the viriato study is a nationwide, prospective, multicenter surveillance study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens commonly associated with  community-acquired respiratory tract infections in portugal. in 2003 and 2004 a total of 2945 isolates was recovered in the 29 laboratories that participated in  the study. testing was undertaken in a central laboratory. of the 513 streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from patients with acute tonsillitis all  were susceptible to penicillin and other beta-lactams but 18.9% were resistant to erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin. the m phenotype dominated (67%), conferring resistance to erythromycin (mic90 = 16 mg/l), clarythromycin and azithromycin, but susceptibility to clindamycin (mic90 = 0.094 mg/l). from patients with lower respiratory tract infection 1,300 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 829 of haemophilus influenzae, and 303 of moraxella catarrhalis were  studied. among s. pneumoniae isolates 18.4% were resistant to penicillin (3.5% showing high-level resistance), 7.1% to cefuroxime, 0.5% to amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, 18.8% to erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin,  14.9% to tetracycline, 16.5% to co-trimoxazole, and 0.4% to levofloxacin. beta-lactamases were produced by 10.0% of h. influenzae and 96.4% of m. catarrhalis. in h. influenzae resistance to clarithromycin was 5.5% and to co-trimoxazole was 13.4%. most strains were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, azithromycin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. in m. catarrhalis resistance to co-trimoxazole was 27.1% and to tetracycline 1.0%. all strains were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, clarithromycin, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. penicillin was the most active antimicrobial agent against s. pyogenes and amoxycillin/clavulanate and the quinolones the most active in vitro simultaneously against s. pneumoniae, h. influenza and m. catarrhalis.

TI  == changing epidemiology of outpatient bacteremia in 3- to 36-month-old children after the introduction of the heptavalent-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  == background: the introduction of routine vaccination with heptavalent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine has changed the overall incidence of bacteremia in children  3 months-3 years old. objective: to describe the changing incidence and etiology  of bacteremia in previously healthy toddlers presenting to outpatient clinical settings. methods: retrospective case series of all blood cultures obtained between september 1998 and august 2003 in kaiser permanente northern california outpatient clinics and emergency departments from previously healthy children 3 months-3 years old. results: implementation of routine vaccination with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine resulted in an 84% reduction of streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia (1.3-0.2%) and a 67% reduction in overall bacteremia (1.6-0.7%) in the study population. the rate of blood culture isolation of contaminating organisms remained unchanged at 1.8%; therefore, by the end of the  study, >70% of organisms identified in blood cultures were contaminants. during the 5 study years, total blood cultures drawn decreased by 35% in outpatient pediatric clinics but remained unchanged in emergency departments. by 2003, one-third of all pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures were escherichia coli, one-third were non-vaccine serotype s. pneumoniae, the majority of the remaining one-third were staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., neisseria meningitidis and streptococcus pyogenes. in our population of children routinely  immunized with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, a white blood cell count >15,000 by itself is a poor predictor of bacteremia in the febrile toddler (sensitivity, 74.0%; specificity, 54.5%; positive predictive value, 1.5%; negative predictive value, 99.5%). conclusion: in the united states, routine vaccinations with haemophilus influenzae type b and s. pneumoniae vaccines have made bacteremia in the previously healthy toddler a rare event. as the incidence  of pneumococcal bacteremia has decreased, e. coli, salmonella spp. and staphylococcus aureus have increased in relative importance. the use of the white blood cell count alone to guide the empiric use of antibiotics is not indicated.  new guidelines are needed to approach the previously healthy febrile toddler in the outpatient setting.

TI  == the use of macrolides in treatment of upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem among upper respiratory tract pathogens. resistance to beta-lactam drugs among streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus pyogenes is increasing. as safe and well-tolerated antibiotics, macrolides play a key role in the treatment of community-acquired upper respiratory tract infections (rtis). their broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive cocci, such as s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, atypical pathogens, h. influenzae (azithromycin and clarithromycin), and moraxella catarrhalis, has led to the widespread use of macrolides for empiric treatment of upper rtis and as alternatives for patients allergic to beta-lactams. macrolide resistance is increasing among pneumococci and recently among s. pyogenes, and is associated with increasing use of the newer macrolides, such as azithromycin. ribosomal target modification mediated by erm(a) and erm(b) genes and active efflux due to mef(a) and mef(e) are the principal mechanisms of  resistance in both s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. recently, ribosomal protein and rna mutations have been found to be responsible for acquired resistance to macrolides in s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and h. influenzae. although macrolides  are only weakly active against macrolide-resistant streptococci species, producing an efflux pump (mef), and are inactive against pathogens with ribosomal target modification (erm), treatment failures are uncommon. therefore, macrolide  therapy, for now, remains a good alternative for treatment of upper rtis; however, continuous monitoring of the local resistance patterns is essential.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel c12 vinyl ketolides.
AB  == a novel series of c12 vinyl erythromycin derivatives have been discovered which exhibit in vitro and in vivo potency against key respiratory pathogens. the c12 modification involves replacing the natural c12 methyl group in the erythromycin  core with a vinyl group via chemical synthesis. from the c12 vinyl macrolide core, a series of c12 vinyl ketolides was prepared. several compounds were found  to be potent against macrolide-sensitive and -resistant bacteria. the c12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k showed a similar antimicrobial spectrum and comparable activity to the commercial ketolide telithromycin. however, the pharmacokinetic profiles of c12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k in rats differ from that of telithromycin by having higher lung-to-plasma ratios, larger volumes of distribution, and longer half-lives. these pharmacokinetic differences have a pharmacodynamic effect as both 6j and 6k exhibited better in vivo efficacy than telithromycin in rat lung infection models against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae.

TI  == [community-acquired acute maxillary sinusitis or rhinosinusitis in adults in france: current management].
AB  == sinus infections, often viral, are a common reason for physician visits. the multiplicity of clinical presentations makes its diagnosis difficult. the problem is to recognize bacterial infection without additional testing, except in cases of treatment failures, complications or relapse. patients with signs suggestive of rhinosinusitis fall into one of four basic clinical situations: common colds,  'doubtful' rhinosinusitis, apparent acute maxillary bacterial rhinosinusitis, and complications. anterior rhinoscopy may help confirm diagnosis. current bacterial  epidemiology is based on the results of clinical studies, microbial ecology, and  samples taken in cases of treatment failure. the two bacteria isolated most frequently are streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, both of which pose resistance problems. moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus are isolated less often. the dominant issue in management of acute rhinosinusitis is whether to use antibiotic or symptomatic treatment. for viral infections, antibiotic therapy is useless and highly inadvisable. for 'doubtful' infections, symptomatic treatment is likely to lead to recovery. the use of non-recommended antibiotics also increases the risk of selection of resistant bacteria. when bacterial rhinosinusitis is strongly suspected, recourse to antibiotic treatment is recommended in view of the benefits in this situation  (afssaps 2005). this treatment is probabilistic, should be decided at the end of  the consultation, and follows the afssaps guidelines.

AB  == the growing resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin can be overcome  by increasing the dose of the penicillin administered. this generated the recommendation that the adult dose of amoxicillin for the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis (ams) be increased from 1.5 g/day to 4.0 g/day. the objective of this study was to investigate whether the higher dose of amoxicillin is more effective than the previously recommended dose in eradicating s. pneumoniae from  the nasopharynx of patients who present with ams. nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 58 patients with ams were studied: 30 received amoxicillin 1.5 g/day given in divided doses three times a day for 10 days (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 4:1 formulation) and 28 were treated with amoxicillin 4.0 g/day given in divided doses twice a day for 10 days (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 16:1 formulation). seventy-one potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated: s. pneumoniae (27 isolates), haemophilus influenzae non-type b (25), moraxella catarrhalis (5), streptococcus pyogenes (5) and staphylococcus aureus (9). the number of s. pneumoniae isolates in the 1.5 g/day group was reduced from 14 to 9 (2 intermediately resistant and 3 highly resistant). in contrast, the number of s. pneumoniae isolates in the 4.0 g/day group was reduced from 13 to 2 (1 highly resistant) (p<0.05). no differences were noted in the eradication rate of other groups of isolates, which were all susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. these data illustrate the superiority of 4.0 g/day amoxicillin/clavulanic acid compared with 1.5 g/day amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the eradication of s. pneumoniae from the nasopharynx.

TI  == single-dose azithromycin for the treatment of children with acute otitis media.
AB  == azithromycin is an azalide with in vitro activity against otitis media pathogens, good middle ear penetration and a prolonged half-life. a total of four clinical trials have evaluated the clinical success rate, safety and compliance of single-dose azithromycin (30 mg/kg) in the treatment of children with otitis media. among all the patients treated with single-dose azithromycin (30 mg/kg), and presented previously in four published clinical trials, end-of-treatment clinical success was 88% (544 out of 619) and maintained clinical success at the  end-of-study was 82% (498 out of 610). three of the four studies included a mandatory baseline tympanocentesis. the overall end-of-treatment and end-of-study clinical success rates among all culture-positive patients was 84% (222 out of 263) and 80% (210 out of 263), respectively. per pathogen end-of-treatment clinical success rates observed were 91% (125 out of 137) among patients with streptococcus pneumoniae, 77% (75 out of 97) among patients with haemophilus influenzae, 100% (14 out of 14) among patients with moraxella catarrhalis, 64% (seven out of 11) among patients with baseline streptococcus pyogenes and 25% (one out of four) among patients with a s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae mixed infection. clinical success was observed in 90% (106 out of 118) of patients with baseline macrolide-susceptible s. pneumoniae and in 67% (14 out of 21) among patients with baseline macrolide-resistant s. pneumoniae (p = 0.01). adverse events were uncommon, mostly mild and transitory gastrointestinal complaints, and in the two larger comparative trials, were less frequent than the rates observed  with the comparator agents. compliance was excellent (99-100%). single-dose azithromycin (30 mg/kg) represents an alternative for the treatment of pediatric  patients with uncomplicated acute otitis media, particularly in those geographic  regions where high-level s. pneumoniae macrolide resistance is uncommon, and for  those patients that require directly observed therapy or when compliance may be a problem.

TI  == resistant microorganisms in head and neck infections.
AB  == the key pathogens most commonly associated with acute infections in the upper respiratory tract include streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes. antimicrobial resistance amongst these organisms to many of the commonly used agents for treatment continues to evolve. s. pneumoniae is probably the most important pathogen in the respiratory tract and antimicrobial resistance of this organism to many drugs appears to be rising. for some organisms, such as s. pyogenes, resistance to standard therapy such penicillin has not been described. for others, such as m. catarrhalis, beta-lactamase production has become the norm, with over 90% of isolates now producing this enzyme. one of the major drivers of resistance continues to be the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in the community. this is complicated by the fact that most therapy is empiric and the exact etiology of a  patient's infection is not known. despite the fact that the clinical impact of antibiotic resistance on patient outcomes is not always clear, it remains prudent to consider the issue of resistance when selecting therapy for a patient and to continue to strive for appropriate antibiotic use as a means to stem the tide of  evolving resistance.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in community-acquired pulmonary pathogens.
AB  == among infectious diseases, pneumonia is still the ;;captain of the men of death.'' etiologic diagnosis is often unreliable; consequently, clinicians must know epidemiology of community-acquired pneumonia for optimizing empiric antibiotic therapy. in recent years, all major pulmonary pathogens have become more and more resistant to conventional antibiotics. penicillin-resistant and even multiresistant pneumococci have spread worldwide, but primarily in the united states, some european countries, south africa, and the far east. a similar trend is evidenced by ampicillin-resistant hemophilus influenzae, whereas moraxella catarrhalis almost invariably produces beta-lactamases. the widening of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from hospitals to the community may be the new reality of the 1990s. increasing erythromycin resistance of streptococcus pyogenes requires beta-lactam therapy. the spread of both cromosomally and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases makes treatment of infections caused by gram-negative enterobacilli more difficult. bacterial resistance creates a challenge for clinicians from the viewpoint of correct and successful management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == enhanced efficacy of single-dose versus multi-dose azithromycin regimens in preclinical infection models.
AB  == objectives: as a result of the prolonged half-life and unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) characteristics of azithromycin, shorter dosing regimens  are being evaluated for the treatment of community-acquired infections. to provide further support for a shorter dosing regimen, the efficacy of azithromycin was determined in preclinical infection models comparing single- versus multi-dose regimens. methods: the efficacy of single versus multi-dose regimens of azithromycin was compared in mouse pneumonia, acute peritonitis, and  neutropenic thigh infection models and in a gerbil model of haemophilus influenzae acute otitis media. azithromycin was administered as a single oral dose on the first treatment day, or as two divided doses over 2 treatment days, or as three divided doses over 3 treatment days. the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin was profiled following single and multi-dose regimens with the single dose data fit to an emax model to characterize the pk-pd of azithromycin.  results: in the mouse efficacy models, administration of single-dose azithromycin produced superior rates of survival and bacterial clearance compared with the same total dose divided over 2 or 3 days. in the gerbil model, a single dose sterilized the middle ear and more rapidly cleared h. influenzae. the pharmacokinetic evaluation confirmed similar total exposure (auc) in serum and pulmonary tissue for the three regimens. correlation of pk-pd parameters and antimicrobial efficacy confirmed a concentration-dependent and dosing-independent relationship for azithromycin. conclusions: these data are consistent with data reported from clinical studies and indicate that a single-dose regimen would be at least as effective as the same dose administered over several days.

AB  == objective: to study the frequency of isolation of potential pathogens and interfering bacteria in the posterior nasopharynx of otitis media-prone (omp) children and their smoking and nonsmoking parents to possibly explain why active  and passive exposure to smoking is associated with carriage of potentially pathogenic bacteria and an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in both  adults and children. setting: outpatient clinic. participants: twenty omp children and their smoking parents (smoking group) and 20 omp children and their  nonsmoking parents (nonsmoking group). interventions: posterior nasopharynx cultures were taken from 20 omp children and their smoking parents and 20 omp children and their nonsmoking parents. main outcome measure: potential pathogens  and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. results: fourteen potential pathogens were isolated from smoking parents, and 17 were recovered from their children. concordance in isolation of a pathogen between a parent and child was noted in 11 instances. three potential pathogens were isolated from nonsmoking parents (p<.001 compared  with the parents and children in the smoking group and children in the nonsmoking group), and 16 were recovered from their children. bacterial interference by normal flora isolates against potential pathogens was noted in 58 instances in smoking parents and in 55 instances in their children (p<.05). bacterial interference was noted in 129 instances in nonsmoking parents (p<.05 compared with the parents and children in the smoking group and children in the nonsmoking group) and in 55 instances in their children. conclusions: a high recovery rate of potential pathogens and a low number of interfering organisms were observed in omp children. this was not related to their parents' smoking habits. the posterior nasopharynx flora of smoking parents contained more potential pathogens similar to the ones recovered from omp children and fewer interfering organisms than nonsmoking parents.

TI  == [in vitro activity of telithromycin against community acquired respiratory pathogens].
AB  == background: telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial, that can be useful for the treatment of respiratory infections. aim: to compare in vitro activity of telithromycin against respiratory pathogens, isolated in outpatient clinics. material and methods: two hundred eighty strains isolated from patients with respiratory infections, were studied. the strains studied were s pneumoniae, penicillin sensitive (spns:57); intermediate (spni:35), resistant (spnr:25); s pyogenes (sp:57); h influenzae (hin 51); m catarrhalis (mc:25) and s aureus meticillin sensitive (saus:30). minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) by broth microdilution was studied for telitrhomycin and levofloxacin in all strains. other antimicrobials studied, but not in all strains were erythromycin, clindamycin, trimetoprim sulphamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime. results: all strains were sensible to telithromycin at a concentration -4 microg/ml. mic 90 and its range for spns was 0.03 microg/ml (-0.004-0.12), for spni was 0.03 microg/ml (-0.004-025), for spnr was 0.06 microg/ml (-0.004-0.25), for hin was 2 microg/ml (0.12-4), for sp was 0.5 microg/ml (-0.004-2), for mc was 0.5 microg/ml (0.06-2) and for sau was 0.25 microg/ml (0.06-0.25). conclusions: all studied pathogens were sensible to telithromycin in vitro. this antimicrobial is an alternative for the treatment of community acquired respiratory infections.

TI  == recovery of potential pathogens and interfering bacteria in the nasopharynx of smokers and nonsmokers.
AB  == background: active smoking and passive exposure to cigarette smoke are associated with colonization by some potentially pathogenic species of bacteria and an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in both adults and children. in an  attempt to explain these observations, this study compared the frequency of isolation of potential pathogens, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that possess interfering capabilities (ie, interfering with the in vitro growth of potential pathogens) in the nasopharynx of smokers to their recovery in nonsmokers. methods: nasopharyngeal specimens for cultures were taken from 20 smokers and 20  nonsmokers. potential pathogens, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. results: fourteen potential pathogens (0.7 per patient) were isolated from nasopharyngeal  cultures obtained from 11 of the 20 smokers, and 4 (0.2 per patient) were recovered from 3 of the 20 nonsmokers (p < 0.01). in vitro bacterial interference between two aerobic (alpha-hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci) and two anaerobic species (prevotella and peptostreptococcus species), and four potential pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae [non-type b], moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes) was observed. bacterial interference was noted in 61 instances against the four potential pathogens by 22 normal flora isolates that were recovered from the group of smokers, and in 155 instances by 50 isolates from the group of nonsmokers (p < 0.01). conclusions: these findings illustrate for the first time that the nasopharyngeal flora of smokers contains fewer aerobic and anaerobic organisms with interfering capabilities and more potential pathogens compared with those of nonsmokers.

TI  == acute otitis media caused by streptococcus pyogenes in children.
AB  == background: streptococcus pyogenes, or group a beta -hemolytic streptococcus (gas), is an important causative agent of bacterial pharyngotonsillititis and skin, soft-tissue, and invasive infections. although it is also an important pathogen in acute otitis media (aom), its exact role has not been determined. methods: patients aged 0-18 years with aom, from whom a specimen of middle-ear fluid was obtained and cultured during 1999-2003, were enrolled. streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and gas were considered pathogens. information collected included demographic characteristics, clinical history, and signs and symptoms. results: gas otitis was observed in 350 (3.1%) of 11,311 episodes (of which 117 were also culture-positive for other pathogens). the other 10,961 episodes involved h. influenzae only (n = 2507), s.  pneumoniae only (n = 2131), dual infection with h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae (n = 1290), m. catarrhalis only (n = 129), and other combinations of pathogens (n = 271). increased age and jewish ethnicity were independent, significant, positive risk factors for gas aom, and fall season was a negative risk factor. episodes of gas infection were less frequently bilateral, febrile, and accompanied by other systemic findings than were other episodes of other types of infection. most patients with gas aom presented with acute drainage from the ears. a lower proportion of cases of aom were due to gas in children with recurrent aom and in patients recently treated with antibiotics, compared with patients with aom who did not have these factors. the risk for mastoiditis was highest among patients with gas aom, compared with patients infected with other pathogens: 11.6 episodes per 1000 episodes of gas aom, compared with 2.2, 0.3, and 0 episodes of mastoiditis per 1000 episodes of aom due to s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis, respectively. conclusion: compared with aom caused by pathogens other than gas, gas aom is characterized by older age and higher local aggressiveness manifested by lower rates of fever and respiratory symptoms and higher rates of tympanic perforation and mastoiditis.

TI  == rapid identification and strain-typing of respiratory pathogens for epidemic surveillance.
AB  == epidemic respiratory infections are responsible for extensive morbidity and mortality within both military and civilian populations. we describe a high-throughput method to simultaneously identify and genotype species of bacteria from complex mixtures in respiratory samples. the process uses electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and base composition analysis of pcr amplification products from highly conserved genomic regions to identify and determine the relative quantity of pathogenic bacteria present in the sample. high-resolution genotyping of specific species is achieved by using additional primers targeted to highly variable regions of specific bacterial genomes. this method was used to examine samples taken from military recruits during respiratory disease outbreaks and for follow up surveillance at several military  training facilities. analysis of respiratory samples revealed high concentrations of pathogenic respiratory species, including haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. when s. pyogenes was identified in samples from the epidemic site, the identical genotype was found in almost all recruits. this analysis method will provide information fundamental to understanding the polymicrobial nature of explosive epidemics of respiratory disease.

AB  == a multicenter susceptibility surveillance (the s.a.u.c.e. project) including 2,721 streptococcus pneumoniae, 3,174 streptococcus pyogenes, and 2,645 haemophilus influenzae consecutive isolates was carried out in 25 hospitals all over spain from november 2001 to october 2002 to evaluate the current epidemiology of resistance of the main bacteria involved in community-acquired respiratory tract infections. susceptibility testing was performed in a single centralized laboratory by a broth microdilution method. the prevalence of resistant s. pneumoniae strains was 0.4% for cefotaxime, 4.4% for amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 25.6% for cefuroxime-axetil, 34.5% for erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin, and 36.0% for cefaclor. phenotypes of resistance to erythromycin were mls(b) (macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b) in 89.9% (gene ermb) and m (macrolide) in 9.7% of cases (gene mefa). no strain harbored both genes simultaneously. serotypes 19, 6, 23, 14, and 3 were the most  prevalent, accounting for 54.6% of the total isolates. resistance to macrolides seems to be the most alarming point, since among penicillin-susceptible isolates  it reached 15.1% compared to 55.8% among penicillin-resistant strains. geographically, a number of regions had rates of erythromycin resistance above 40% (even higher in children). resistance to erythromycin was also high in s. pyogenes isolates: mean regional 33.2%, beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae were 20%, whereas 4.4% had a beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant phenotype. we highlight the importance of different geographical frequencies of coresistance (associations of resistance to different drugs within the same species) and coupled resistance (association of resistance between different species) probably resulting from different local coselective events.

TI  == the use of macrolides in treatment of upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem among upper respiratory tract pathogens. resistance to beta-lactam drugs among streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus pyogenes is increasing. as safe and well-tolerated antibiotics, macrolides play a key role in the treatment of community-acquired upper respiratory tract infections (rtis). their broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive cocci, such as s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, atypical pathogens, h. influenzae (azithromycin and clarithromycin), and moraxella catarrhalis, has led to the widespread use of macrolides for empiric treatment of upper rtis and as alternatives for patients allergic to b-lactams. macrolide resistance is increasing among pneumococci and recently among s. pyogenes, and is associated with increasing use of the newer macrolides, such as azithromycin. ribosomal target modification mediated by erm(a) and erm(b) genes and active efflux due to mef(a) and mef(e) are the principal mechanisms of  resistance in s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. recently, ribosomal protein and rna  mutations have been found responsible for acquired resistance to macrolides in s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and h. influenzae. although macrolides are only weakly active against macrolide-resistant streptococci species producing an efflux pump  (mef) and are inactive against pathogens with ribosomal target modification (erm), treatment failures are uncommon. therefore, macrolide therapy, for now, remains a good alternative for treatment of upper rtis; however, continuous monitoring of the local resistance patterns is essential.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in the nasopharyngeal flora of children with acute otitis media and otitis media recurring after amoxicillin therapy.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of the organisms isolated from the nasopharynx of children who presented with acute otitis media (aom) or otitis media that recurred after amoxicillin therapy. nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 72 patients, 40 with aom and 32 with recurrent otitis media (rom), were analysed. thirty-six potentially pathogenic organisms were recovered in 34 (85 %) of the children from the aom group, and 42  were isolated from 29 (91 %) of the children from the rom group. the organisms isolated were streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 26), haemophilus influenzae non-type  b (n = 22), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 13), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 8) and staphylococcus aureus (n = 9). resistance to the eight antimicrobial agents used  was found in 37 instances in the aom group as compared to 99 instances in the rom group (p < 0.005). the difference between aom and rom was significant with streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to amoxicillin (p < 0.005), to amoxicillin/clavulanate (p < 0.005), to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (p < 0.01), to cefixime (p < 0.01) and to azithromycin (p < 0.01), and for h. influenzae resistance to amoxicillin (p < 0.025). these data illustrate the higher recovery  rate of antimicrobial-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and h. influenzae from the nasopharynx of children who had otitis media that recurred after amoxicillin  therapy than those with aom.

TI  == hepatoprotective and antibacterial effects of extracts from trichilia emetica vahl. (meliaceae).
AB  == trichilia emetica vahl. (meliaceae) is a tree widely distributed in tropical africa. it has been used in mali folk medicine for the treatment of various illnesses. the aim of this work was to study the hepatoprotective and antibacterial effects of a crude aqueous extract from trichilia emetica root. an  ethyl ether fraction from the aqueous extract was also prepared and studied. we have examined the hepatoprotective activity of the extracts on ccl4-induced damage in rat hepatocytes, their toxicity using the brine shrimp bioassay and their antibacterial activity against clinical isolated bacterial strains, which are commonly responsible for respiratory infections. a preliminary phytochemical  analysis showed a high polyphenolic content in the aqueous extract and the presence of limonoids in the ethyl ether fraction. these latter compounds may be  considered responsible for the good activity against the bacterial strains tested. trichilia emetica extracts exerted also a significant (p<0.05) hepatoprotective effect at a dose of 1000 microg/ml both on plasma membrane and mitochondrial function as compared to silymarin used as a positive control. these activities may be a result of the presence of either polyphenols or limonoids. finally, both the aqueous extract and its ethyl ether fraction did not show toxicity (lc50>1000 microg/ml) in the brine shrimp bioassay.

TI  == microbiology and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses in children. predominant anaerobic organisms isolated in peritonsillar, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal abscesses are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.; aerobic organisms are group a streptococcus ( streptococcus pyogenes ), staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae . anaerobic bacteria can be isolated from most abscesses whenever appropriate techniques for their cultivation have been used, while s. pyogenes is isolated in only about one third of cases. more than two thirds of deep neck abscesses contain beta-lactamase producing organisms. management of tonsillar, peritonsillar, and retropharyngeal abscesses is similar. systemic antimicrobial therapy should be given in large doses whenever the diagnosis is made. however, when pus is formed, antimicrobial therapy is effective only in conjunction with adequate surgical drainage. untreated abscesses can rupture spontaneously into the pharynx, causing catastrophic aspiration. other complications are extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through facial planes and the prevertebral space. death can occur from aspiration, airway obstruction, erosion into major blood vessels, or extension to the mediastinum.

TI  == effect of antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin and cefprozil on bacterial interference and beta-lactamase production in the adenoids.
AB  == to compare the effects on the bacterial flora of the adenoids of antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin or cefprozil, we enrolled in a prospective randomized study 60 children scheduled for elective adenoidectomy because of recurrent otitis media. they were randomized before surgery into 3 groups of 20 patients each: a no-therapy group, and groups with 10 days of either amoxicillin or cefprozil therapy. core adenoid materials were quantitatively cultured for aerobic and facultative bacteria. the in vitro ability of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (ahs) to inhibit the growth of non-type b haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae was determined. the number of organisms in adenoids obtained from patients treated with either antibiotic was reduced as compared to  that in adenoids from controls. however, in patients treated with amoxicillin, a  significant decline in the number of ahs, and an increase (in staphylococcus aureus) or no change in the number of other beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) was noted. in contrast, in those treated with cefprozil, no change was noted in the frequency of recovery of ahs, and the number of blpb decreased. interfering ahs were more often recovered in patients treated with cefprozil. we  conclude that the adenoids contain more interfering ahs after therapy with a second-generation oral cephalosporin (cefprozil) than after amoxicillin therapy.  this study suggests a potential beneficial effect of using an antimicrobial that  selectively spares interfering ahs while inhibiting blpb.

TI  == acute mastoiditis in infancy: the soroka experience: 1990-2000.
AB  == acute mastoiditis (am) is an uncommon but serious complication of acute otitis media (aom). in the pre-antibiotic era, am was seen more frequently than it is today, but it was rare in infants. however, in the last two decades an increase in the incidence of am in infancy has been reported in the literature. during the years 1990-2002, we treated 113 patients with 128 episodes of am; of them, 24 were infants (median age 6 months; 18 males) who suffered from 26 episodes of am. twenty developed am as a complication of their first episode of aom. one of the four infants with a prior history of aom suffered from common variable immunodeficiency. a significant increase in the incidence of am in infants was recorded during the study period (p = 0.01). the most common presenting clinical  signs were post-auricular swelling and fever >38 degrees c (77% and 77%, respectively, of all patients). seventeen episodes of am were not treated with prior antibiotics. tympanocentesis was performed in all episodes of am. middle ear fluid culture was positive in 17 (65%) of the 26 am episodes. the most common pathogens cultured were streptococcus pneumoniae (10 infants, 58% of all pathogens, 3/10 intermediately susceptible to penicillin) followed by streptococcus pyogenes (4, 23%), non-typable h. influenzae (2, 12%) and s. aureus (1, 6%). temporal bone ct showed bone destruction in 14 patients; 3 infants had subperiosteal abscesses and 3 lateral sinus thrombosis. ten infants underwent mastoid surgery due to non-resolution of symptoms and signs with antibiotic therapy. eight underwent cortical mastoidectomy with two patients undergoing ventilation tube introduction only. the remainder of the infants healed with conservative treatment. conclusions: (1) a significant increase in the incidence  of am in infants was recorded over the last decade, though a specific reason for  this trend remains uncertain; (2) most of the cases of am followed the infant's initial aom episode, and most of the infants had not received prior antibiotic therapy; (3) the clinical signs and symptoms of am were more severe in infants than in older patients; (4) while s. pneumonia was the most common pathogen isolated in middle ear fluid cultures, the involvement of s. pyogenes in am was higher than that reported in aom.

TI  == respiratory infections and asthma: current treatment strategies.
AB  == infections such as lower respiratory illness potentially contribute to the initiation of asthma and are major factors in recurring acute exacerbations of the condition. although typical bacterial respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and hemophilus influenzae do not initiate asthmatic exacerbations, data from a subgroup of adults suggest a potential role for mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae in the onset of asthma. common cold viruses, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) in young children and rhinoviruses in older children and adults, are the major causes of acute exacerbations of asthma. these exacerbations are not prevented with maintenance therapies that are used for chronic asthma, but do respond to short courses of systemic corticosteroids. there are continued attempts to produce a successful vaccine and antiviral agents for the treatment of rsv that are more effective and more practical to use than ribavirin, which is currently the only available antiviral for rsv. the prevention and treatment of rhinovirus  infections have focused on the major receptor for the virus, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1), which is located on respiratory epithelial cells. a multivalent, recombinant, antibody fusion protein identified as cfy196 has high avidity for icam-1 and has the potential to protect against rhinovirus infection. another approach for preventing and treating rhinovirus infection uses a recombinant, soluble, truncated form of icam-1 in which the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the protein have been deleted. an initial clinical study on this agent demonstrated clinical efficacy in ameliorating the symptoms of experimental rhinovirus infection in volunteers, but did not significantly prevent infection.

AB  == macrolides are important antibiotics used in treatment of respiratory tract infections in humans. although some of these compounds have been in use for 50 years, it has not been until the last few years that their mechanism of action and the nature of ribosomal-based resistance could be more fully understood. with the advent of robust crystals of ribosomal 50s subunits, and structural resolution of macrolides and ketolides complexed to either haloarcula marismortui or deinococcus radiodurans 50s, the ability to dissect the binding modes and understand resistance at the level of the ribosome became possible. this review article compares the binding features of 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides to  that of ketolides telithromycin and abt-773 as revealed at the atomistic level. attempts to understand how modifications to 23s rrna and/or mutations in ribosomal proteins l4 and l22 that have been found to confer resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and haemophilus influenzae are  told from the perspective of the ribosome.

TI  == use of an oligonucleotide array for laboratory diagnosis of bacteria responsible  for acute upper respiratory infections.
AB  == we developed a diagnostic array of oligonucleotide probes targeting species-specific variable regions of the genes encoding topoisomerases gyrb and pare of respiratory bacterial pathogens. suitable broad-range primer sequences were designed based on alignment of gyrb/pare sequences from nine different bacterial species. these species included corynebacterium diphtheriae, fusobacterium necrophorum, haemophilus influenzae, legionella pneumophila, moraxella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes. specific probe sequences were selected by comparative analysis against the european bioinformatics database, as well as gyrb/pare sequences generated for this study. to verify specificity, at least six initial oligonucleotide probe sequences per bacterial species were tested by hybridization on a solid glass support using culture collection strains as templates. finally, three oligonucleotide probes per bacterial species were utilized to examine 65 middle ear fluid and 29 throat swab samples. the sensitivities of the developed assay compared to classic culture from middle ear fluid samples for h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and s. pneumoniae were 96 (93 for culture), 73 (93 for culture), and 100% (78% for culture), respectively. no cross-reactivity with bacterial species belonging to the normal oral flora was observed when the 29 throat swab samples were studied.  the sensitivity of the assay to detect s. pyogenes from these samples was 93% (80% for culture). these results provide a proof of concept for the diagnostic use of microarray technology based on broad-range topoisomerase gene amplification, followed by hybridization and specific detection of bacterial species.

TI  == [activity of telithromycin and other oral antibiotics against respiratory tract pathogens with acquired mechanisms of resistance].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial resistance among strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenza, and streptococcus pyogenes has limited the usefulness of conventional agents for the treatment of some infectious diseases related with these microorganisms. there is thus a clear need for new antimicrobial agents active against these resistant strains. objectives: to assess the in vitro susceptibility to telithromycin and other oral antimicrobial agents of 307 strains of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and s. pyogenes with acquired mechanisms of resistance to macrolides and/or beta-lactams. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the agar dilution method, and results were preferentially evaluated according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) guidelines. results: the activity of telithromycin against erythromycin-resistant s. pneumoniae was excellent. all the strains were  inhibited with 2 mg/l, regardless of the mechanism of macrolide resistance exhibited. telithromycin was slightly more active than the tested macrolides in beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae strains, with a mic90 of 2 mg/l. telithromycin also demonstrated potent activity against macrolide-resistant s. pyogenes. the mic of telithromycin was > 4 mg/l for only one out of the 202 tested strains. conclusions: telithromycin is a very promising therapeutic option against bacterial pathogens of the respiratory tract, including strains that have developed mechanisms of resistance to macrolides and/or beta-lactams.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of telithromycin and beta-lactam antimicrobials against community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract pathogens in the united states: findings from the protekt us study, 2000-2001.
AB  == background: telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial that was developed to provide good activity against resistant respiratory tract pathogens. protekt us (prospective resistant organism tracking and epidemiology for the ketolide telithromycin in the united states) is a multicenter in vitro surveillance study  that was initiated in 2000 to chart the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (cartis). objective: this article reports first-year results from protekt us pertaining to the comparative in vitro activity of telithromycin  and beta-lactam antimicrobials against community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract pathogens. methods: data were compiled on the comparative in vitro activity of telithromycin and beta-lactams against streptococcus pneumoniae (10,103 isolates), streptococcus pyogenes (3918 isolates), and haemophilus influenzae (2706 isolates). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and susceptibilities were determined according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards methods. results: in total, 38.8% (3920/10,103) of pneumococcal isolates were not susceptible to penicillin (12.5% [1266] intermediate [mic, > or =0.12-1.0 mg/dl], 26.3% [2654] resistant [mic, > or =2 mg/dl]). telithromycin was highly active against s pneumoniae (mic required to inhibit 90% of isolates [mic(90)], 0.5 mg/l), with 99.6% (10,062/10,103) of isolates fully susceptible (mic, < or =1 mg/l). based on mic(90)s, the rank order of antimicrobial activity was telithromycin (0.5 mg/l), followed by amoxicillin/clavulanate (2 mg/l), penicillin (4 mg/l), and cefuroxime (8 mg/l). telithromycin retained high activity (mic(90), 1 mg/l) against penicillin-resistant penumococci that showed high levels of coresistance to beta-lactams. all isolates of s pyogenes were fully susceptible to the beta-lactams tested. beta-lactamase production was common among h influenzae isolates (28.3% [765/2706]). telithromycin was active against h influenzae (mic(90), 4 mg/l), irrespective of beta-lactamase production. conclusion: overall, these findings from the first year of protekt us support the potential value of telithromycin in the treatment of cartis.

TI  == novel ketolide antibiotics with a fused five-membered lactone ring--synthesis, physicochemical and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == in an effort to find novel semisynthetic macrolides with extended antibacterial spectrum and improved activity we prepared a series of compounds based on commercially available clarithromycin, a potent and safe antimicrobial agent of outstanding clinical and commercial interest. according to the literature, improvement of antibacterial activity of erythromycin type antibiotics can be achieved by introduction of fused heterocycles such as cyclic carbonates or carbamates at positions 11 and 12 (such as in telithromycin). in the course of the work presented here, a similar, hitherto unprecedented set of compounds bearing a five-membered lactone ring fused to positions 11 and 12 was prepared based on carbon-carbon bond formation via intramolecular michael addition of a [(hetero)arylalkylthio]acetic acid ester enolate to an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone as the key step. some of the ketolide compounds described in this paper were highly active against a representative set of erythromycin sensitive and erythromycin resistant test strains. the best compound showed a similar antimicrobial spectrum and comparable activity in vitro as well as in vivo as telithromycin. furthermore, some physicochemical properties of these compounds were determined and are presented here. on the basis of these results, the novel  ketolide lactones presented in this paper emerged as valuable lead compounds with comparable properties as the commercial ketolide antibacterial telithromycin (ketek).

TI  == [what is the importance of bacterial eradication in the treatment of respiratory  tract infections?].
AB  == during the last few years, increasing antibiotic resistance amongst the major respiratory pathogens in the community has compromised the choice of empirical therapy for some respiratory tract infections. of special interest has been the progressive increase in the resistance rates of streptococcus pneumoniae to macrolides and penicillin, and of s. pyogenes to macrolides. several studies have confirmed the association between community use of certain antibiotics and the development of resistance in s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. nevertheless, not all the antibiotics have the same ability to select resistance and not all microorganisms are affected in the same way. the aim of antimicrobial therapy in  respiratory tract infections is bacterial eradication. pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics can be used to predict bacteriological eradication with antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == optimizing antibacterial therapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections in children in an era of bacterial resistance.
AB  == the spread of antibacterial resistance in bacteria that commonly cause childhood  community-acquired respiratory tract infections (rtis), such as acute otitis media, community-acquired pneumonia, and acute pharyngitis, is a major healthcare problem. one of the foremost concerns is the rapid increase in penicillin, macrolide, and multidrug resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. there is also a  rising prevalence of macrolide resistance in streptococcus pyogenes in pockets of the united states, and beta-lactamase production in haemophilus influenzae is widespread. although data are limited, some evidence suggests that resistance to  antibacterials can impair bacteriologic and clinical outcomes in childhood rtis.  optimizing antibacterial use is important both in the care of individual patients and within strategies to address the wider problem of antibacterial resistance. this involves encouraging judicious antibacterial use (i.e., reducing overuse for viral infection and prophylaxis), and preventing misuse through the wrong choice, dosage, and duration of therapy. given that initial therapy is usually empiric, antibacterials used to treat community-acquired rtis in children should ideally have the following properties: an optimal targeted spectrum of activity; high clinical and bacteriologic efficacy against respiratory pathogens, including resistant strains; simple, short-course therapy; and good tolerability and palatability. new antibacterials will continue to have a role in the treatment of rtis in children, especially where resistance compromises existing therapies.

TI  == bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of oral gatifloxacin for the treatment of recurrent/nonresponsive acute otitis media: an open label, noncomparative, double tympanocentesis study.
AB  == background: gatifloxacin is an 8-methoxyfluoroquinolone with good activity against respiratory pathogens. objectives: to document the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of gatifloxacin in recurrent/nonresponsive acute otitis media (aom). methods: one hundred sixty patients 6 to 48 months of age with recurrent/nonresponsive aom received gatifloxacin suspension (10 mg/kg once daily for 10 days). recurrent aom was defined as > or =3 aom episodes during the previous 6 months or > or =4 aom episodes during the previous 12 months. nonresponsive aom was defined as aom occurring < or =14 days after completing antibiotic treatment or not improving after > or =48 h of therapy. middle ear fluid (mef) obtained by tympanocentesis pretreatment (day 1) and 3 to 5 days after initiation of treatment (days 4 to 6) was cultured. additional mef cultures were obtained if clinical failure or recurrence of aom occurred. bacteriologic failure was defined by culture-positive mef during treatment. patients were followed until days 22 to 28. susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution. results: one hundred twenty-eight (80%) patients completed treatment, and 32 discontinued the study prematurely (adverse events, 17; lost to follow-up, 10; consent withdrawal, 3; and laboratory abnormalities, 2). from 89 patients (median age, 1 year; median number of prior aom episodes, 4; range, 0 to 12), 121 pathogens were recovered: haemophilus influenzae, 74 (61%); streptococcus pneumoniae, 36 (30%); moraxella catarrhalis, 9 (7%); and streptococcus pyogenes, 2 (2%). the 36 s. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to gatifloxacin (mic50 0.25 microg/ml); 26 of 36 (72%) were penicillin-nonsusceptible (15 fully resistant). all 74 h. influenzae isolates were susceptible to gatifloxacin (mic < or = 0.03 mg/ml). fourteen of 74 (19%) and 9 of 9 (100%) h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis isolates, respectively, produced beta-lactamase. bacteriologic eradication was achieved for 118 of 121 (98%) pathogens: 74 of 74 h. influenzae; 34 of 36 (94%) s. pneumoniae; 9 of 9 m.  catarrhalis; and 1 of 2 s. pyogenes. clinical improvement/cure at end of treatment was seen in 103 of 114 (90%) clinically evaluable patients. clinical recurrence of aom after completion of therapy occurred in 31 patients. of the 27  recurrent aom cases in which tympanocentesis was performed, there were 16 (59%) new infections, 4 (15%) culture-negative results and only 7 (26%) true bacteriologic relapses. adverse events were recorded in 21 of 160 (13%) patients: vomiting, 16; diarrhea, 3; maculopapular rash, 2. no articular adverse events were recorded. conclusion: gatifloxacin is efficacious and safe for the treatment of recurrent/nonresponsive aom.

TI  == does the tonsillar surface flora differ in children with and without tonsillar disease?
AB  == objective: to investigate whether the tonsillar flora differ in children with and without adenotonsillar disease. material and methods: tonsil surface swabs were taken from 218 children indicated for adenotonsillectomy because of moderate symptoms of recurrent tonsillopharyngitis or adenotonsillar hypertrophy (t+ads group). control swabs were taken from 100 children without symptoms of adenotonsillar disease who visited the ophthalmology clinic. potential respiratory pathogens were identified. results: potential respiratory pathogens were found in 54% of the t+ads group, compared to 41% of the control group (p = 0.04). haemophilus influenzae was the commonest pathogen in both groups, being found in 41% of the t+ads group and 34% of the control group. moraxella catarrhalis was found more often in the t+ads group compared to the control group: 7% vs 0% (p = 0.004). h. influenzae was found in 32% of the children with  recurrent tonsillitis, compared to 48% of the children with symptoms of tonsillar hypertrophy (p = 0.03). conclusions: the prevalence of potential respiratory pathogens on the tonsillar surface of children with moderate symptoms of recurrent tonsillopharyngitis and/or tonsillar hypertrophy differs only slightly  from that in children without symptoms of adenotonsillar disease. variations in the microbial flora do not seem to play an essential role in the predisposition of these children to tonsillar disease.

TI  == acute mastoiditis in southern israel: a twelve year retrospective study (1990 through 2001).
AB  == background: acute mastoiditis is a serious complication of acute otitis media (aom) and has been increasingly reported in the last decade. objectives: to report the experience accumulated with acute mastoiditis at the soroka university medical center, beer-sheva, israel, in a period of increasing antimicrobial resistance with streptococcus pneumoniae. patients and methods: we reviewed the records of all children with acute mastoiditis hospitalized from 1990 through 2001. acute mastoiditis was diagnosed when one or more of the physical signs of mastoiditis (swelling, erythema, tenderness of the retroauricular area and anteroinferior displacement of the auricle) were diagnosed in the presence of concomitant or recent (< or =4 weeks) aom. results: one hundred sixteen episodes  of acute mastoiditis occurred in 101 children age 2 months to 14 years (median, 25 months; 19% <1 year old). the average yearly incidence was 6.1 cases per 100 000 population <14 years old, with a significant increase in the number of cases  during the study period. acute mastoiditis was the first evidence of aom in 10 (10%) patients. fever >38 degrees c and >15,000 wbc/mm3 were present in 67 and 43% of cases, respectively. irritability, retroauricular swelling, redness and protrusion of the auricle occurred more commonly in patients <3 years old (79, 90, 84 and 76% vs. 28, 42, 45 and 30%, respectively, in patients > or =3 years old; p < 0.002). computed tomography scans were performed in 54 of 116 (47%) cases and revealed bone destruction in 38 (70%). periosteal abscess and lateral sinus vein thrombosis were diagnosed in 8 and 2 patients, respectively. simple mastoidectomy was done in 32 of 116 (28%) cases, after no response to intravenous antibiotics was observed; ventilation tubes were inserted in 12 patients. cultures were obtained at admission in 83 (72%) episodes (71 by tympanocentesis and 12 from ear discharges). overall 43 pathogens were isolated: 34 at admission; 14 at surgery; and 5 at both occasions. the most commonly isolated organisms were s. pneumoniae (14 of 43, 33%; 4 penicillin-nonsusceptible), streptococcus pyogenes (11 of 43, 26%), nontypable haemophilus influenzae (6 of 43, 14%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 of 43, 12%) and escherichia coli (4 of 43, 9%). all s.  pneumoniae organisms were isolated between 1996 and 2001. conclusions: (1) the incidence of acute mastoiditis in children in southern israel is greater than that reported in the literature; (2) a significant increase in the number of cases was recorded during the study period; (3) the clinical picture of acute mastoiditis was more severe in infants and young children; (4) the pathogen distribution in acute mastoiditis differs from that of aom with significantly higher rates of s. pyogenes and lower rates of nontypable h. influenzae recovery; (5) penicillin-nonsusceptible s. pneumoniae played only a minor role in the etiology of acute mastoiditis in southern israel.

TI  == comparative activity of garenoxacin and other agents by susceptibility and time-kill testing against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and respiratory pathogens.
AB  == objectives: garenoxacin is a novel des-f(6)quinolone that has shown excellent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of clinically important microorganisms. in this study, its activity was examined, in comparison with that of other antimicrobial agents, by susceptibility and time-kill testing against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and respiratory pathogens. methods: overall, 200 bacterial strains were tested. the antimicrobial activity of garenoxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin,  amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, erythromycin and clarithromycin. in addition, the bactericidal activity of garenoxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was evaluated by time-kill analysis against four strains each of staphylococci [two methicillin-susceptible (mssa) and two methicillin-resistant (mrsa)], pneumococci (two penicillin-susceptible and two penicillin-resistant) and streptococcus pyogenes (two erythromycin-susceptible and two erythromycin-resistant). antibiotics were tested at concentrations 1-8 x mic. results: mic90 values of garenoxacin for the mssa and mrsa strains were 0.03 and 2 mg/l, respectively. among all the quinolones tested, garenoxacin yielded the lowest mic values against all pneumococci (mic90 0.12 mg/l) irrespective of macrolide resistance; the rank order of activity was garenoxacin> moxifloxacin>levofloxacin>ciprofloxacin. excellent activity was shown also against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 <or= 0.03 mg/l) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 <or= 0.03 mg/l). ninety percent of s. pyogenes were inhibited at garenoxacin concentrations equal to 0.25 mg/l, its activity not being influenced  by macrolide susceptibility. garenoxacin was rapidly bactericidal against staphylococci, producing a >or= 3 log10 decrease in viable counts (cfu/ml) within 3 h at 4 x mic, whereas a moderate, slower killing rate was observed versus streptococci. conclusions: this investigational des-f(6)quinolone represents a promising alternative for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of telithromycin and beta-lactam antimicrobials against bacterial pathogens from community-acquired respiratory tract infections: data from the first year of protekt (1999-2000).
AB  == the in vitro activity of telithromycin, a new ketolide, was compared with beta-lactam antimicrobials against pathogens commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections. these pathogens were collected during 1999-2000 as part of the ongoing protekt surveillance study. globally, penicillin nonsusceptibility among streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3362) was 36.3%, ranging from 21.5% (australasia) to 68.0% (far east). telithromycin showed higher potency (mic90 0.12 mg/l) than beta-lactams against s. pneumoniae; 99.9% of all and 99.6% of multi-resistant isolates were susceptible to telithromycin. among streptococcus pyogenes isolates (n = 1485), 100% were susceptible to beta-lactams, and the telithromycin mic50 and mic90 were both 0.015 mg/l. among haemophilus influenzae (n = 2948), 16.6% produced beta-lactamase, which reduced the activity of ampicillin, cefaclor and cefprozil. 99.9% of h. influenzae were susceptible to telithromycin and the mic range for m. catarrhalis was 0.004-0.5 mg/l. the first year results of protekt confirmed high potency for telithromycin  against common respiratory tract pathogens, including beta-lactam-resistant strains.

TI  == [susceptibility of major pathogens of acute pharyngitis and tonsillitis to levofloxacin and other oral antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == a total of 2865 strains of the causative organisms isolated from the patients with acute pharyngitis and tonsillitis at the primary medical institutions were used in this study. the mics of levofloxacin (lvfx) and other oral antimicrobial  drugs were determined and evaluated by the nccls guideline. lvfx, cefditoren (cdtr) and cefcapene (cfpn) were potently active against 773 isolates of hemophilus influenzae, the mic50s of lvfx being < or = 0.06 microgram/ml and also the same as the mic90s of lvfx. lvfx was the most active against 496 isolates of  enterobacteriaceae. the mic50s of lvfx were < or = 0.06 microgram/ml and were lower than those of cdtr, cefdinir (cfdn) and cefpodoxime (cpdx) (mic50s: 0.5 microgram/ml). the mic90s of these cephems were markedly higher than the respective mic50s, whereas mic50 of lvfx was 0.12 microgram/ml, only twice the mic50. against the majority of streptococcus pyogenes (555 isolates) and streptococcus spp. (495 isolates), cdtr, cfdn, cpdx and cfpn were highly active (mics: < or = 0.06 microgram/ml), and clarithromycin (cam) and azithromycin (azm) were also active against these organisms (mics: 0.12 to 0.25 microgram/ml). against s. pneumoniae (92 isolates), cdtr and cfdn were active (mic50s: 0.12 and  0.25 microgram/ml, respectively). however, the mic90s of these drugs were 4-8 times the mic50s. against moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (454 isolates), lvfx was potently active, the mic90 of lvfx being < or = 0.06 microgram/ml and mic90s of the other cephems being 0.5 microgram/ml or more. when the susceptibility of these strains to lvfx was evaluated by the nccls guideline, about 3% of other streptococcus spp. were resistant to the drug but no test strains resistant to lvfx were detected in h. influenzae, s. pyogenes or enterobacteriaceae. on the other hand, the percentages of strains susceptible to  the cephems tested were 60-90%, which were quite different according to kinds of  drugs and species used. furthermore, the strains of s. pneumoniae resistant to cfdn and cpdx, and those to cam and azm were 21-25% and 50% or more, respectively, whereas no lvfx-resistant strains were detected. the major pathogens isolated from patients with pharyngitis and tonsillitis in the primary  institutions were highly susceptible to lvfx. these results suggest that lvfx is  a useful drug which is potently active against the strains resistant to oral cephem and macrolide antibiotics.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of macrolides against recent clinical isolates, and analysis of resistant mechanisms].
AB  == we examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), azithromycin (azm) and rokitamycin (rkm), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. s. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. antimicrobial activities against s. aureus,  s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as em and cam, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide,  rkm. by contrast, against s. pneumoniae, rkm was more effective than 14-membered  macrolides. six, three and four strains of s. aureus, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, mic of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of em, cam or azm. isolation frequency of resistant strains to rkm was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides:  only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. no resistant strain was recognized in m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. further, we  analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant  strains by the double-disk method. methylation was major mechanism in s. aureus,  and in s. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. in s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of 4903 bacterial isolates to gemifloxacin--an advanced fluoroquinolone.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against over 4900 bacterial isolates was determined by microbroth dilution with interpretation in accordance with nccls guidelines. susceptibility results were compared with those for ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. gemifloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones were not affected by either beta-lactamase production or penicillin-resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. the mic90 values for gemifloxacin were: s. pneumoniae 0.063 mg/l; haemophilus influenzae 0.016 mg/l; moraxella catarrhalis 0.008 mg/l, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 0.063 mg/l; methicillin-susceptible streptococcus pyogenes 0.031 mg/l; enterobacteriaceae 0.031-0.16 mg/l; pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 mg/l; neisseria meningitidis 0.008 mg/l. the mic90 for gemifloxacin was lower than those for the  other quinolones tested against s. pneumoniae (ciprofloxacin 2-4 mg/l, gatifloxacin 0.5 mg/l, levofloxacin 1-2 mg/l, moxifloxacin 0.25 mg/l). this study confirms the enhanced potent activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive pathogens, its broad-spectrum, gram-negative activity and indicates that gemifloxacin is likely to have an important role in treating patients with gram-positive and/or gram-negative infections.

TI  == low rates of antimicrobial resistance in respiratory pathogens from a pediatric population in north-eastern italy.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pyogenes are the main agents of bacterial upper respiratory tract infections in infants and children. in the past decades, the proportion of patients infected with drug-resistant organisms has increased; surveying at a regional level is important for understanding the size of the problem and elaborating therapeutic guidelines based on local epidemiology. methods: since 1997, all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pyogenes have  been surveyed for antimicrobial resistance. results: in our zone, we found 3.5% penicillin-resistant and 18% macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 15.8%  ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae and 24.8% erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes. conclusions: penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) in our area does not represent a real concern; conversely, macrolide resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae is relatively frequent. resistance to ampicillin in haemophilus influenzae in our area seems relatively low, due to beta-lactamase production. even for streptococcus pyogenes, macrolide resistance rates in our region are relatively low if compared with other countries and other italian regions. in conclusion, in our area penicillins are still the first choice drugs, at least in noncomplicated or not recurrent infections.

TI  == bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) production by the normal flora of the nasopharynx: potential to protect against otitis media?
AB  == the normal bacterial flora of the upper airways provides an important barrier to  invading pathogens. this study investigated the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) by streptococci isolated from the nasopharyngeal flora of children who either do or do not experience recurrent acute otitis media (aom). twenty children with recurrent aom and 15 controls were tested. swabs from the nasopharynx were evaluated for streptococci having blis activity against two  representative strains of each of the aom pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococci displaying strong blis activity were characterized further and tested for known streptococcal bacteriocin structural genes. sixty-five per cent  of children had nasopharyngeal streptococcal isolates that were inhibitory to strains of one or more of the aom pathogens. six children (17 %) had streptococci that demonstrated strong blis activity against strains of at least three of the pathogenic species. three of these inhibitory isolates were streptococcus salivarius, two were s. pneumoniae and one was s. pyogenes. the inhibitory s. salivarius and s. pyogenes were shown to have structural genes for known streptococcal bacteriocins. no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups of children with respect to the presence of inhibitory streptococci in their nasopharyngeal floras. the finding of s. salivarius with strong inhibitory activity against several aom pathogens in the nasopharyngeal flora of children is unique. although there is no clear evidence from the present study that these organisms protect against aom, their low pathogenicity and strong in-vitro blis production capability indicate that they should be incorporated in future trials of bacteriotherapy for recurrent aom.

TI  == comparative activity of telithromycin against typical community-acquired respiratory pathogens.
AB  == objectives: respiratory tract infections (rtis) remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. major bacterial pathogens in rtis, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, have exhibited increasing resistance to a variety of antibiotics during the past decades. telithromycin, the first ketolide, was designed especially to overcome this resistance. the present study was conducted to assess the comparative activity of telithromycin against typical rti pathogens in austria. methods: a total of 1,015 bacterial isolates was tested, including s. pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae. mics of the following antimicrobials: penicillin g, ampicillin (for h. influenzae), azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin a and telithromycin were determined using the nccls broth microdilution method. results: telithromycin showed excellent activity against s. pneumoniae, with 99.8% of all  isolates being susceptible. penicillin remained active with an mic50 and mic90 of 0.007 mg/l. nevertheless, a notable increase in penicillin intermediate-resistant and resistant isolates, from 4.9% in 1996 to the present rate of 10%, was observed. there was also a distinct rise in the resistance levels of s. pneumoniae against the macrolides. all tested isolates of s. pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin and telithromycin, and only low levels of resistance against telithromycin were found in s. aureus (2.2%, mic90 of 0.5 mg/l). no telithromycin-resistant isolate of h. influenzae could be detected. conclusions:  this study demonstrates the rising prevalence of resistance among s. pneumoniae not only to penicillin but also to other antimicrobials. it also shows the value  of telithromycin as an attractive option for the empirical treatment of community-acquired rtis in an era of widespread antibacterial resistance.

TI  == antibacterial resistance of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens recovered from patients in latin america: results from the protekt surveillance study (1999-2000).
AB  == protekt (prospective resistant organism tracking and epidemiology for the ketolide telithromycin) is a global surveillance study established in 1999 to monitor antibacterial resistance of respiratory tract organisms. thirteen centers from argentina, brazil and mexico participated during 1999-2000; they collected 1806 isolates (streptococcus pneumoniae 518, haemophilus influenzae 520, moraxella catarrhalis 140, staphylococcus aureus 351, s. pyogenes 277). overall,  218 (42.1%) of the s. pneumoniae isolates had reduced susceptibility to penicillin, 79 (15.3%) were penicillin-resistant and 79 (15.3%) were erythromycin-resistant. mexico had the highest prevalence of penicillin (76.5%) and erythromycin (31.2%) resistance. of 77 erythromycin-resistant s. pneumoniae tested for resistance genotype, 43 possessed mef(a), 33 possessed erm(b) and 1 possessed both erm(b) and mef(a) mechanism. all s. pneumoniae isolates were fully susceptible to telithromycin, linezolid, teicoplanin and vancomycin. among h. influenzae isolates, 88 (16.9%) produced beta-lactamase, ranging from 11% (brazil) to 24.5% (mexico). among m. catarrhalis isolates, 138 (98.6%) produced beta-lactamase. twenty-four (8.7%) of the s. pyogenes isolates were erythromycin-resistant; resistance being attributable to mefa (n=18), ermtr (n=5) and ermb (n=1). all h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis and s. pyogenes were fully susceptible to telithromycin. methicillin resistance was found in 26.5% of the s. aureus isolates (argentina 15%; mexico 20%; brazil 31.3%). telithromycin was effective against 97.7% of methicillin-susceptible isolates. protekt confirms that antibacterial resistance is an emerging problem in latin america. the previously reported high levels of pneumococcal resistance to the beta-lactam and macrolides were exceeded. new agents that do not induce resistance or that exert  low selective pressure, e.g. telithromycin, are essential to safeguard future antibacterial efficacy.

AB  == background: high dose (70 to 90 mg/kg/day) amoxicillin is recommended as first line therapy of acute otitis media (aom) in geographic areas where drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae is prevalent. information on the bacteriologic efficacy  of high dose amoxicillin treatment for aom is limited. objectives: to evaluate the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of high dose amoxicillin as first line therapy in aom. methods: in a prospective study 50 culture-positive patients ages 3 to 22 months (median, 9 months; 77% <1 year) were treated with high dose amoxicillin (80 mg/kg/day three times a day for 10 days) no antibiotics were administered 72 h before enrollment. twenty-four (48%) patients presented with their first episode of aom. middle ear fluid was cultured by tympanocentesis at enrollment and on days 4 to 6 of therapy. additional middle ear fluid cultures were obtained if clinical relapse occurred. bacteriologic failure was defined by  positive cultures on days 4 to 6 and clinical failure by no change or worsening of aom signs and symptoms and requirement for additional antibiotics during therapy and/or at end of therapy. patients were followed until day 28 +/- 2. susceptibility to penicillin and amoxicillin was measured by e-test. results: sixty-five organisms were recovered at enrollment: haemophilus influenzae (38), streptococcus pneumoniae (24), streptococcus pyogenes (2) and moraxella catarrhalis (1). eighteen (75%) s. pneumoniae were nonsusceptible to penicillin (mic > 0.1 microg/ml). all 24 s. pneumoniae isolates had amoxicillin mic < or = 2.0 microg/ml. thirteen (34%) of the 38 h. influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. eradication was achieved in 41 (82%) patients for 54 of 65 (83%) pathogens: 22 of 24 (92%) s. pneumoniae, 21 of 25 (84%) beta-lactamase-negative h. influenzae, 8 of 13 (62%) beta-lactamase-positive h. influenzae, 2 of 2 s. pyogenes and 1 of 1 m. catarrhalis. seven organisms not initially present were isolated on days 4 to 6 in 5 patients: 3 beta-lactamase-positive h. influenzae; 1 beta-lactamase-negative h. influenzae; 2 s. pneumoniae; and 1 m. catarrhalis. in  total 14 of 50 (28%) patients failed bacteriologically on days 4 to 6 (persistence + new infection), of whom 9 (64%) had beta-lactamase-positive h. influenzae. three (33%) of the 9 patients with bacteriologic failure (2 beta-lactamase-positive h. influenzae, 1 s. pneumoniae) failed also clinically on days 4 to 6. conclusions: the predominant pathogens isolated from children with aom failing high dose amoxicillin therapy were beta-lactamase-producing organisms. because its overall clinical efficacy is good, high dose amoxicillin is still an appropriate choice as first line empiric therapy for aom, followed by a beta-lactamase-stable drug in the event of failure.

TI  == amoxicillin-sulbactam: a clinical and therapeutic review.
AB  == combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with penicillins, especially aminopenicillins, have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most of the  common pathogens of the respiratory and urinary tracts. this means that they are  an ideal treatment for infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, special cases  of pharyngeal tonsillitis (recurring forms, indirect pathogenic action, or after  the failure of amoxicillin monotherapy), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystitis, urethritis, etc. the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is active against both beta-lactamase producer and nonproducer strains, and is effective against gram-positive cocci (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus of nonhospital origin), gram-negative cocci (neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis and others), gram-negative bacilli  (nonhospital strains of haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and others) and anaerobes. its antimicrobial activity means that it is indicated in the treatment of respiratory, ear, nose and throat, urinary, dermatological and gynecological infections caused by susceptible germs, as well  as in a variety of surgical situations (both as a treatment and as prophylaxis).  it is absorbed very well orally, and its pharmacokinetic profile is very favorable, with very good tissue penetration. it is reasonably well tolerated: in a variable percentage of cases it may cause modification of intestinal transit and/or fecal consistency, which usually abates spontaneously. the new formulation for administration at intervals of 12 h is easier to use, is better tolerated and favors completion of therapy. in summary, the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is effective and well tolerated in most infections of nonhospital origin in adults and children.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens in north america in 1999-2000: findings of the protekt surveillance study.
AB  == the protekt surveillance study commenced in 1999 to examine the antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired respiratory pathogens. we report here the results from 2371 isolates collected during 2000 by north american centers (canada, n = 7; usa, n = 8). overall, 21.3% of pneumococci (n = 687) were penicillin g-resistant (canada, 10.3%; usa, 32.6%). corresponding rates of erythromycin resistance were 16.3% and 31.5%. telithromycin inhibited all penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant isolates at < or =1 microg/ml. among 612 hemophilus influenzae isolates, 22.4% were beta-lactamase-positive. antimicrobial susceptibility of h. influenzae varied between 82.4% (clarithromycin) and 100% (cefpodoxime, levofloxacin). importantly, one isolate was found to be resistant to both moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. most moraxella catarrhalis isolates were  highly susceptible to the antimicrobials tested, except ampicillin. all streptococcus pyogenes isolates (n = 382) were penicillin-susceptible and 5.2% were non-susceptible to erythromycin. s. pyogenes showed cross-resistance to other macrolides yet remained inhibited by telithromycin at < or =0.5 microg/ml.  methicillin resistance among staphylococcus aureus was common (19.9%), particularly in the usa. the protekt study confirms the widespread prevalence of  antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens in north america, and hence the need for continued surveillance to guide optimal empiric therapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == national surveillance programme on susceptibility patterns of respiratory pathogens in south africa: moxifloxacin compared with eight other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == aims: the susceptibility patterns of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes isolated from specimens submitted to 12 private laboratories in south africa were determined. methods: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determinations were performed on the isolates in the microbiology laboratory at tygerberg hospital according to the recommendations of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). results: according to the nccls breakpoints, 24% of 729 s pneumoniae isolates were sensitive, 30% intermediate, and 46% resistant to penicillin. rates of macrolide resistance were high, with 61% of the pneumococci being resistant to clarithromycin and azithromycin. co-trimoxazole resistance was also high, with 28% of pneumococcal strains being sensitive, 21% intermediate, and 51% resistant. beta lactamase was produced by 7% of 736 h influenzae isolates and 91% of 256 m catarrhalis isolates. the quinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were universally active against all isolates tested, which included s pneumoniae, h influenzae, m catarrhalis, k pneumoniae, and s pyogenes. conclusions: haemophilus influenzae and s pneumoniae  were the most commonly isolated organisms. resistance to penicillin was one of the highest reported in the world (76%) in s pneumoniae, as was macrolide resistance in pneumonocci, although surprisingly, only 14% of s pyogenes were resistant. the quinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were active against all organisms tested, including the penicillin and macrolide resistant strains and moxifloxacin was more active than levofloxacin against pneumococci.

TI  == quantitative detection of moraxella catarrhalis in nasopharyngeal secretions by real-time pcr.
AB  == the recognition of moraxella catarrhalis as an important cause of respiratory tract infections has been protracted, mainly because it is a frequent commensal organism of the upper respiratory tract and the diagnostic sensitivity of blood or pleural fluid culture is low. given that the amount of m. catarrhalis bacteria in the upper respiratory tract may change during infection, quantification of these bacteria in nasopharyngeal secretions (npss) by real-time pcr may offer a suitable diagnostic approach. using primers and a fluorescent probe specific for  the copb outer membrane protein gene, we detected dna from serial dilutions of m. catarrhalis cells corresponding to 1 to 10(6) cells. importantly, there was no difference in the amplification efficiency when the same dna was mixed with dna from npss devoid of m. catarrhalis. the specificity of the reaction was further confirmed by the lack of amplification of dnas from other moraxella species, nontypeable haemophilus influenzae, h. influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus pyogenes, bordetella pertussis, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and various neisseria species. the assay applied to  npss from 184 patients with respiratory tract infections performed with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of up to 98% compared to the culture results. the numbers of m. catarrhalis organisms detected by real-time pcr correlated with the numbers detected by semiquantitative culture. this real-time  pcr assay targeting the copb outer membrane protein gene provided a sensitive and reliable means for the rapid detection and quantification of m. catarrhalis in npss; may serve as a tool to study changes in the amounts of m. catarrhalis during lower respiratory tract infections or following vaccination against s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, or n. meningitidis; and may be applied to other clinical samples.

TI  == current status of bacterial resistance in the otolaryngology field: results from  the second nationwide survey in japan.
AB  == the study reported here was a nationwide assessment of otitis media (466 patients with acute suppurative otitis media and 476 with chronic suppurative otitis media), sinusitis (447 with acute sinusitis and 426 with chronic sinusitis), acute tonsillitis (724 patients), and peritonsillar abscess (141 patients) performed between november 1998 and march 1999. eighty university hospitals, 79 affiliated hospitals, and 103 general practitioners participated. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus(mrsa) comprised 15.6% of the 786 isolated strains of s. aureus. mrsa was frequently detected in patients with suppurative otitis media, but was uncommon in those with acute tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess, and it was more common in those who had already been treated than in those who had not, with a significant difference between the groups. vancomycin (vcm) showed the highest antimicrobial activity against mrsa and no vcm resistance was detected. penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae(pssp), penicillin-intermediate-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) accounted for 49.6%, 28.5%, and 21.9% of the 228 isolated strains of s. pneumoniae, respectively. pisp and prsp were frequently detected in children aged 5 years or younger. beta-lactamase was produced by 96 of the 100 strains (96%) of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. the 281 strains of haemophilus influenzae isolated consisted of 199 beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-sensitive (blnase) strains (70.8%), 65 beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) strains (23.1%), and 17 beta-lactamase-producing strains (6.0%). blnar strains were frequently detected in pretreated patients. of these 281 strains of h. influenzae, 214 had nontypable capsules. in conclusion, the major bacterial species showed resistance to beta-lactams, indicating that care should be taken when selecting an appropriate  antimicrobial agent.

TI  == bacterial aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in south african children.
AB  == little is known of the aetiology, serotypes or susceptibility of the pathogens causing non-resolving otitis media in children receiving care from specialists in private practice in developed or in developing countries. increased access to antibiotics in the community amongst children receiving such private care in south africa may be anticipated to lead to levels of resistance similar to those  found in countries with similar models of private practice, such as the united states. this study was conducted to determine the aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in south african children receiving private care and to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns and serotypes of the bacterial isolates. middle-ear fluid was cultured from 173 children aged two months to seven years with non-resolving acute otitis media accompanied by persistent pain or fever who were referred to otorhinolaryngologists for drainage of middle-ear fluid within 14 days of the start of symptoms. while 92 per cent of the children had recently  received antibiotics and 54 per cent were currently receiving them, bacteria were isolated from 47 children (27 per cent). streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (35), followed by haemophilus influenzae (nine), staphylococcus aureus (six), moraxella catarrhalis (two), streptococcus pyogenes (two) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (one). two isolates were identified in each of eight children. antimicrobial resistance to one or more antibiotics was found in 33/35  (94 per cent) of the pneumococci isolated, with resistance to penicillin in 86 per cent, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 54 per cent and to erythromycin and clindamycin in 69 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. the pneumococcal serotypes found were 19f (28 per cent), 14 (26 per cent), 23f (23 per cent), 6b (nine per cent), 19a (87 per cent), and four (three per cent). children with a bacterial pathogen isolated were younger (mean age of 17 months)  than children from whom no bacteria were isolated (mean age of 23 months; p = 0.03). isolation of a pneumococcus was also significantly associated with younger age (mean = 16 months versus 22 months, p = 0.03), the presence of fever (or = 2.15, p = 0.049), and having one or more prior episodes of otitis media within the six months before tympanocentesis (or = 7.72, p = 0.03). almost all pneumococci isolated from non-resolving acute otitis media in this community are  antibiotic-resistant and should be considered especially in young children who have failed previous therapy and who have non-resolving pain or fever.

TI  == naturally occurring immune response against bacteria commonly involved in upper respiratory tract infections: analysis of the antigen-specific salivary iga levels.
AB  == lyophilized bacterial lysates, which actively stimulate the immune response, are  widely used as vaccines or 'biological response modifiers' in subjects with recurrent bacterial respiratory infections. since vaccines are indicated in the absence or in the presence of a weak constitutive immune response activity, a better knowledge on the 'naturally' occurring antibacterial immune response at the oropharingeal level should be helpful. a study was, therefore, designed to quantify the presence of salivary iga directed against surface antigens bacteria  frequently involved in the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections: klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), staphylococcus aureus (sa), streptococcus pyogenes (spy), morraxella catarrhalis (mc), haemophylus influenzae (hi), and streptococcus pnumoniae (spn). in 34 volunteers (21 adults and 13 children), salivary fluid was collected and the presence of microorganism-specific iga antibodies evaluated by a novel enzyme immuno-assay. in the whole population only 29 and 24% of subjects had iga directed, respectively, to kp and sa, while the immune-response against other microbes was detectable in a small population ranging from 12 to 15% of all subjects studied. we found higher proportions of individuals with strain specific salivary iga in the adult than in the pediatric  population for all the microorganism evaluated. in addition, in children, the only strain inducing a significant production of specific iga at oropharingeal level was kp. interestingly, only ten out of 21 adults and two out 13 children have at least one significantly high antibody titer against one of the bacteria evaluated. nevertheless, when a group of healthy donors was treated with a polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysate (ismigen t.), the large majority developed a specific immune-response in the salivary fluid. these results are thus consistent with the good features of the novel enzyme-immunoassay and with a poor frequency of naturally induced specific anti-microbe antibodies in children and in adults despite the presence on recurrent respiratory infections in their clinical history.

AB  == in recent years one of the more alarming aspects of clinical microbiology has been the dramatic increase in the incidence of resistance to antibacterial agents among pathogens causing nosocomial as well as community-acquired infections. there are profound geographic differences in the incidence of resistance among pathogens of the respiratory tract, only some of which can be explained by the local use of antibiotics. a high percentage of moraxella catarrhalis strains produce beta-lactamase and are thus resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics. in contrast, beta-lactamase production among strains of haemophilus influenzae rarely reaches more than 30% around the world. methicillin-resistance in staphylococcus aureus is a common and increasing problem in hospitals but its extent varies both locally and nationally. resistance is usually associated with  the local spread of resistant strains. high standards of hygiene in hospitals can prevent the spread of such strains but once established they can be difficult to  eradicate. although streptococcus pyogenes remains highly susceptible to penicillins, even after many decades of their use, resistance to macrolides has occurred. this resistance can rise and fall. although the increase of macrolide resistance in s. pyogenes can often be associated with an increase in the use of  these drugs, this is not always so. in some cases it has been shown to be caused  by the spread of one or more resistant clones. eradication of these clones can reduce the level of resistance markedly. resistance to both macrolides and penicillins among strains of streptococcus pneumoniae is seen world-wide but is highly variable from country to country. local habits of drug usage may play a part. in italy, for example, there is preference for the use of parenteral third-generation cephalosporins for some severe infections and there is a corresponding low level of penicillin-resistance among pneumococci.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus (mssa) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci  and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), mssa (n=187), haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. the mic value at which 90% of all enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, mssa, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (mic90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.

AB  == in prepubertal girls with vaginal discharge, consideration of the etiology must be given to respiratory pathogens (streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis), enteric pathogens (escherichia coli, shigella, and yersinia), poor hygiene, foreign body, nonabsorbent undergarments, irritants, vulvar skin disease, anatomic abnormalities (double vagina with fistula, pelvic abscess, and  ectopic ureter), and sexual abuse. prepubertal girls, outside the newborn period, with suspected gonococcal infection should be strongly considered to be victims of sexual abuse, once congenital and other newborn acquired forms of gonorrhea are excluded. we present a case of a three-year-old female with vaginal discharge and fever with a clouded social history, disproportionate distress on physical exam, and initial laboratory gram stain suggestive of gonococcus.

TI  == surveillance of resistance in bacteria causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics in community-acquired respiratory tract infections is a serious problem and is increasing in prevalence world-wide at an  alarming rate. streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the main organisms implicated in  respiratory tract infections, has developed multiple resistance mechanisms to combat the effects of most commonly used classes of antibiotics, particularly the beta-lactams (penicillin, aminopenicillins and cephalosporins) and macrolides. furthermore, multidrug-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae have spread to all regions of the world, often via resistant genetic clones. a similar spread of resistance has been reported for other major respiratory tract pathogens, including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes. to develop and support resistance control strategies it is imperative to obtain accurate data on the prevalence, geographic distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens and how this relates to antibiotic  prescribing patterns. in recent years, significant progress has been made in developing longitudinal national and international surveillance programs to monitor antibiotic resistance, such that the prevalence of resistance and underlying trends over time are now well documented for most parts of europe, and many parts of asia and the americas. however, resistance surveillance data from parts of the developing world (regions of central america, africa, asia and central/eastern europe) remain poor. the quantity and quality of surveillance data is very heterogeneous; thus there is a clear need to standardize or validate the data collection, analysis and interpretative criteria used across studies. if disseminated effectively these data can be used to guide empiric antibiotic therapy, and to support-and monitor the impact of-interventions on antibiotic resistance.

TI  == what can protekt tell us at a local level?
AB  == because of increasing antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections (cartis), surveillance at local,  regional, national and international levels is necessary to provide information to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy. protekt (prospective resistant organism tracking and epidemiology for the ketolide telithromycin) is a longitudinal, global, multicenter surveillance study designed to monitor the worldwide development of antimicrobial resistance, and disseminate up-to-date information via the internet to assist in the choice of empiric therapy at the local level. in this paper, the results for the first year of protekt are presented from a local perspective. in examples from japan, usa and europe, great variation was observed between antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae in countries and cities in close proximity to each other. telithromycin demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against all organisms and is a potential new candidate for the empiric therapy of cartis. the first year of protekt has provided valuable information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of bacterial agents causing cartis that can be used for guiding empiric therapy and policies. variation in local resistance observed in this study further emphasizes the need  for accurate up-to-date surveillance data at the local level.

TI  == global surveillance through protekt: the first year.
AB  == the increasing antimicrobial resistance amongst bacterial pathogens causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections (cartis) necessitates surveillance at the local, regional, national and international levels to provide information to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy. protekt (prospective resistant organism tracking and epidemiology for the ketolide telithromycin) is a longitudinal, global, multicenter surveillance study designed to monitor the worldwide development of antimicrobial resistance and disseminate up-to-date information via the internet to assist in the choice of empiric therapy at the local level. in this paper, the results for the first year of protekt are presented from a global perspective. streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, are the principal organisms responsible for the majority of cartis. the global prevalence of penicillin g resistance in s. pneumoniae has risen to an alarming 36.3% (high-level resistance 22.1%, intermediate-level 14.2%) with the highest prevalence found in asia (68%). in all regions, macrolide resistance is greater than penicillin g resistance with a global prevalence rate of 31.2%. high resistance rates were also found for tetracycline (30.5%) and co-trimoxazole (43.9%), and multiresistance was found between penicillin g, macrolides, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole. the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis was found to be similar to previous reports. macrolide resistance in s. pyogenes was 0.3% overall. telithromycin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against all organisms and is a potential new candidate for the empiric therapy of cartis. the first year of protekt has provided valuable information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of bacterial agents causing cartis that can be used for  guiding empiric therapy and policies. the rapidly developing and geographically varying resistance observed in this study further emphasizes the need for accurate up-to-date surveillance data.

TI  == intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to  human subjects. methods: thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. the indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole  (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results: all the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by hplc. the level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. a mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. the level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. conclusion: the vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the mic(90) against proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterobacter spp.

TI  == evolving resistance patterns in community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens: first results from the protekt global surveillance study. prospective resistant organism tracking and epidemiology for the ketolide telithromycin.
AB  == in recent years, antibacterial resistance among respiratory pathogens implicated  in community-acquired respiratory tract infections (rtis) has spread worldwide at an alarming rate. thus, there is a pressing need for new antibacterials that retain activity against resistant organisms, have a low potential to select for resistance and do not induce cross-resistance. telithromycin is the first of a new class of antibacterials - the ketolides - that have been designed specifically to overcome resistance among respiratory tract pathogens. this paper presents the first results of the protekt study (prospective resistant organism tracking and epidemiology for the ketolide telithromycin), a worldwide surveillance study initiated to chart the prevalence of important resistance phenotypes and genotypes and the comparative activity of telithromycin against such strains. analysis of over 7,000 bacterial isolates by april 2001 has confirmed the notable prevalence of strains resistant to commonly prescribed rti  antibacterials for all the pathogens studied. telithromycin demonstrates high activity against isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, irrespective of penicillin g, macrolide or fluoroquinolone resistance. telithromycin is also highly active against other respiratory tract pathogens, including streptococcus pyogenes and beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. these data justify the assertion that telithromycin is a promising new candidate for the empirical treatment of community-acquired rtis, particularly in the face of increasing antibacterial resistance.

TI  == clinical efficacy of cefpodoxime in respiratory tract infection.
AB  == acute otitis media (aom), sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis are respiratory tract infections frequently encountered by primary-care physicians. increasing bacterial resistance, particularly in streptococcus pneumoniae, which is one of the most important respiratory tract bacteria implicated in community-acquired respiratory tract infections, has led to concern about the current options for empirical antibiotic treatment and has prompted a search for effective alternative treatments. data from in vitro studies show that cefpodoxime has good activity against the main respiratory tract pathogens, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes. clinical studies confirm the efficacy of cefpodoxime in aom, sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis. as with all broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is the risk of promotion of bacterial  resistance associated with overuse. however, if used with care, cefpodoxime can be considered as an alternative for empirical treatment of bacterial respiratory  tract infections encountered in general practice, particularly where penicillins  and macrolides have reduced efficacy against the main bacterial pathogens.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral beta-lactam antibiotics as a two-dimensional approach to their efficacy.
AB  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters are increasingly recognized as important determinants of the therapeutic efficacy of an antibiotic. for beta-lactam antibiotics, the most important determinant of the antimicrobial efficacy, and hence predictor of therapeutic efficacy, is the length of time that serum concentrations exceed the mic. dosing schedules for beta-lactam antibiotics should maintain serum concentrations above the mic for the bacterial pathogen for at least 50% of the dosing interval to achieve therapeutic efficacy and prevent the development of resistance. this is a basic criterion for the clinical efficacy of beta-lactams. a combination of microbiological activity and pharmacokinetic characteristics was applied to calculate the time that serum antibiotic concentrations exceed the mic for the major respiratory tract pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae. in contrast with some other oral beta-lactam antibiotics, cefpodoxime 200 mg bd maintains serum concentrations above the mic for each organism for at least 50% of the dosing interval and may therefore be an attractive choice for empirical therapy of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.

AB  == antimicrobial resistance is universally recognized as a major problem. a european resistance survey was established to monitor the activity of widely used oral antibiotics against common respiratory tract pathogens. studies were conducted in italy, spain and austria to monitor resistance patterns among respiratory streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae to amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, penicillin, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefalexin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftibuten, cefpodoxime, clarithromycin and azithromycin (the antibiotics tested varying slightly from country to country). minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the nccls-recommended broth microdilution method. among the antibiotics tested, cefpodoxime, an oral cephalosporin, was remarkably active against the major respiratory pathogens in all three countries. cefpodoxime was more potent than cefaclor, cefixime and ceftibuten against pneumococci, especially against strains with decreased sensitivity to penicillin, and more active than cefaclor and cefuroxime against gram-negative respiratory pathogens. pneumococci and staphylococci displayed a very high level of in vitro macrolide resistance. these data indicate that cefpodoxime represents an appropriate choice in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in the three countries surveyed.

TI  == the effect of carbon dioxide on susceptibility testing of azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin against clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes by broth microdilution and the etest: artemis project-first-phase study.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the effect of carbon dioxide on the susceptibility testing, using broth microdilution and the etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden), of  azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin against streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. methods: fresh clinical isolates collected from 36 hospital laboratories in 12 countries were evaluated using the etest in the presence of carbon dioxide. the isolates were retested under ambient conditions (absence of carbon dioxide) using broth microdilution and/or the etest. results:  carbon dioxide falsely elevated azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin mic90s for s. pneumoniae, determined by the etest, approximately 12-fold. also, the azithromycin mic90 for s. pyogenes was increased fourfold; the effect was less marked for clarithromycin and roxithromycin. when isolates were retested in  the absence of carbon dioxide, using the etest or microdilution, susceptibilities to azithromycin were comparable to those to clarithromycin (s. pneumoniae, 93.4%  versus 91.3%; s. pyogenes, 96.4% versus 95.8%). both organisms were less susceptible to roxithromycin (s. pneumoniae, 71.3%; s. pyogenes, 85.7%). an internal standard control, consisting of 50 isolates each of s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae, confirmed that azithromycin susceptibility testing resulted in falsely elevated mics. conclusions: carbon dioxide falsely elevated azithromycin mics for s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, with an apparent reduction in susceptibility. when the in vitro activity of azithromycin and other macrolides against s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes is being evaluated, awareness of the ph effect is essential.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of dq-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of dq-113, formerly d61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (mic90s) of dq-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. moreover, dq-113 showed the  most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, with a mic90 of 0.25microg/ml. dq-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and dq-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with mic90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, dq-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a mic range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. dq-113 also showed a potent activity against haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (mic90, 0.015 microg/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.03 microg/ml). the activity of dq-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of enterobacteriaceae: the mics of dq-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible pseudomonas  aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. from these results, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.

TI  == [current therapeutical management, new antibiotics and treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacterial ent-infections].
AB  == in bacterial infections of the sinuses and the middle ear streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated, whereas in tonsillopharyngitis streptococcus pyogenes is the most important pathogen. s. aureus is found in up to 40 % in acute and chronic sinusitis and causes severe complications in otitis media, therefore antibiotics used as empirical initial treatment should also be effective against this pathogen. to decrease duration of illness and to avoid serious complications antibiotic treatment of bacterial ent-infections is necessary. the new ketolides and the third and fourth generation quinolones are very effective and the second generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime axetil have proven excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in numerous clinical  trials combined with an excellent resistance pattern over the years. efficacy of  short course therapy (5 days) in sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis has been proven in clinical trials and is cost saving. in more severe infections treated in hospital sequential i. v./oral therapy offers pharmaco-economical benefits. both regimen demonstrate cost savings while maintaining high clinical efficacy. in more severe infections like otitis externa diffusa, otitis externa maligna, otitis media chronica and perichondritis pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen that has to be covered by initial antibiotic treatment. ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are widely used and effective. ciprofloxacin resistance has increased, while ceftazidime susceptibility is unchanged (> 90 %). a dose reduction study with ceftazidime in severe ent-infections showed equivocal efficacy between 3 x 1 g and 3 x 2 g daily that offers a cost benefit of 50 %.

TI  == cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative  pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does  not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg  twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of cefditoren against respiratory pathogens isolated from children in japan.
AB  == there is an increasing spread and incidence of penicillin-resistant bacteria that are becoming less susceptible to commonly prescribed oral antimicrobials, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins. against this background, we undertook this study to determine the prevalence of penicillin resistance in streptococcus  pneumoniae and the in-vitro activity of oral antimitrobials. between april 1996 and december 1997, in 245 children with respiratory tract infections (bronchitis  in 61, pharyngitis in 115, and tonsillitis in 69), 119 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 89 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 61 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 36 strains of staphylococcus aureus, and 34 strains of moraxella catarrhalis were isolated from the pharynx. the antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was assessed by a broth microdilution method. the isolation incidence of penicillin-intermediately resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp) and penicillin-highly resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) was 59.0% and 13.1%, respectively. most strains of pisp and prsp were highly resistant to cefaclor, cefpodoxime, cefteram, cefdinir, clarithromycin, ampicillin, and minocycline, but susceptibile to ofloxacin and cefditoren (cdtr). the in-vitro activity of cdtr was superior to that of other cephalosporins, such as cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime, when tested against both the beta-lactamase-positive and -negative h. influenzae isolated. cdtr was also active against all the other strains, including methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, s. pyogenes, and m. catarrhalis. this  study suggested that cdtr was a useful oral antibiotic for pediatric respiratory  tract infections.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == epidemiological aspects of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens.
AB  == respiratory infections are the most frequent reason for primary health care consultation. the main causes of respiratory tract infections in children are viruses and the most common types are upper respiratory tract infections: common  cold, pharyngitis, otitis media and sinusitis. pneumonia is much more serious. as well as viruses, bacteria are often involved in respiratory tract infections. three bacterial species are most commonly isolated: streptococcus pneumoniae, non-encapsulated haemophilus influenzae and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis.  the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis is streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria isolated from community-acquired infection usually are sensitive to the  majority of suitable drugs, but during the past two decades, significant antibiotic resistance has emerged. resistance to penicillins has spread among h.  influenzae and s. pneumoniae. the mechanism of penicillin resistance in h. influenzae is mainly by production of beta-lactamases tem-1 and rob-1, whereas in s. pneumoniae resistance is an effect of the changes in penicillin binding proteins. among respiratory pathogens, resistance to tetracyclines, macrolides, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones has also appeared. several mechanisms depending on changes in target, active efflux and modifying enzymes are involved.

AB  == community-acquired respiratory tract infections (rtis) are among the most prevalent infectious diseases in the developed world. they cause considerable morbidity, resulting in a major impact on public health both clinically and socioeconomically. the bacterial pathogens most commonly associated with community-acquired rtis are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis, with streptococcus pyogenes predominating in pharyngitis.  over the past years, each of these pathogens has developed mechanisms to evade susceptibility to antibacterials, leading to an alarming global increase in antibacterial resistance among these pathogens. there is great concern that currently available antibacterials are insufficient to treat community-acquired rtis and there is an urgent requirement for new agents with activity against all  strains of common community-acquired rti pathogens. telithromycin (hmr 3647) belongs to a new family of antibacterials, the ketolides, and has been specifically designed for the treatment of community-acquired rtis. this review covers the potent in vitro activity of telithromycin against the most common community-acquired rti pathogens compared with other currently available antimicrobial agents.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity of abt-773 versus macrolides and quinolones against resistant respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == abt-773, a novel ketolide, was compared to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and gemifloxacin against antibiotic-resistant strains recently isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections. mics were determined by agar dilution using standard nccls methodology. abt-773 (mic(90) 0.06 mg/l) was more active than the macrolides (mic(90) > or = 2 mg/l) and fluoroquinolones (mic(90) > or = 0.5 mg/l) against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae.  the fluoroquinolones were the most active agents tested against beta-lactamase-positive haemophilus influenzae (mic(90) < or = 0.01-0.06 mg/l), against which abt-773 (mic(90) 4 mg/l) was comparable to azithromycin and two- and four-fold more active than erythromycin and clarithromycin, respectively. against beta-lactamase positive moraxella catarrhalis, the activity of abt-773 (mic(90) 0.06 mg/l) was comparable to gemifloxacin, trovafloxacin, levofloxacin,  and ciprofloxacin (mic(90) 0.03-0.06 mg/l) and 4- to eightfold greater than that  of clarithromycin, gatifloxacin, and erythromycin. these data suggest abt-773 could be a valuable compound for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including those resistant to usual oral therapy.

TI  == [pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin (zithromac), a novel 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent].
AB  == azithromycin (zithromac), a 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent, was approved to be manufactured in japan in march 2000. it showed good in vitro and/or in vivo antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, peptostreptococcus micros, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae. its activity against h. influenzae was particularly more potent than that of currently used macrolide antibacterial agents. after oral administration to patients, azithromycin was readily absorbed and became widely distributed throughout the body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and phagocytic cells than in serum or plasma. its distribution into phagocytes was as high as more than 10 times that of erythromycin, and azithromycin was readily released from phagocytes in the presence of s. aureus. in experimentally infected mice, the concentration of azithromycin was higher in infected tissues than in uninfected tissues, which indicated that azithromycin was selectively delivered to infected tissues by migrating phagocytes. these pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties were reflected in good clinical results for the treatment of respiratory infections and other infections with once daily dosing for 3 days.

TI  == antibacterial activity of essential oils and their major constituents against respiratory tract pathogens by gaseous contact.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of 14 essential oils and their major constituents in the gaseous state was evaluated against haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. for most essential  oils examined, h. influenzae was most susceptible, followed by s. pneumoniae and  s. pyogenes, and then s. aureus. penicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. pneumoniae were comparable in susceptibility. escherichia coli, which was used as a control, showed least susceptibility. a minimal inhibitory dose (mid) was introduced as a measure of the vapour activity. among 14 essential oils, cinnamon bark, lemon-grass and thyme oils showed the lowest mid, followed by essential oils containing terpene alcohols as major constituents. the essential oils containing terpene ketone, ether and, in particular, hydrocarbon had high mids. the vapour activity on short exposure was comparable to that following overnight  exposure, and rapid evaporation was more effective than slow evaporation of essential oils. the vapour concentration and absorption into agar of essential oils reached a maximum 1 or 2 h after rapid evaporation. these results indicate that the antibacterial action of essential oils was most effective when at high vapour concentration for a short time.

TI  == bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for treatment of acute otitis media.
AB  == background: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (t/s) has often been used as first and  second line of treatment for acute otitis media (aom). because of the increasing  resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae to t/s, we undertook the present study to investigate the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of this drug in aom. methods: fifty-four culture-positive evaluable patients ages 3 to 32 months with aom were treated with t/s 4/20 mg/kg in two divided daily doses for 10 days. middle ear fluid (mef) was cultured at enrollment (day 1) and on days 4 and 5 after initiation of treatment. additional  mef cultures were obtained if clinical relapse occurred. clinical failure was determined when the symptoms and signs of aom did not improve or recurred during  therapy. bacteriologic failure was defined by positive culture on days 4 and 5, or negative on days 4 and 5 but positive again before the end of treatment. patients were followed until day 28 +/- 2. results: a total of 67 organisms were  isolated from mef specimens of the 54 study patients: s. pneumoniae, 24; h. influenzae, 40; and streptococcus pyogenes, 3. fifteen (63%) of 24 s. pneumoniae  were nonsusceptible to t/s (trimethoprim mic, >0.5 microg/ml), of which 10 (67%)  were highly resistant to t/s (trimethoprim mic, > or = 4.0 microg/ml). twelve (30%) of 40 h. influenzae and all 3 s. pyogenes isolates were nonsusceptible to t/s (mic > or = 4.0 microg/ml). bacteriologic eradication occurred in 9 of 9 (100%) and 27 of 27 (100%) t/s-susceptible s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae, respectively, vs. 4 of 15 (27%) and 6 of 12 (50%) t/s-nonsusceptible s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae, respectively (p < 0.001). the 3 patients with s. pyogenes failed bacteriologically. nine new organisms, not initially isolated, emerged during treatment, 7 of which (77%) were resistant to t/s. altogether bacteriologic failure (organisms not eradicated plus newly emerged) occurred in 29 (53%) of 54 patients. clinical failures occurred in 8 (15%) of 54 patients, and in 7 of these 8 cases the clinical failures occurred in those with bacteriologic failures. ten patients relapsed clinically after completion of treatment and in 8 of them tympanocentesis for mef culture was performed. six of  these 8 cultures were positive, and the initial pathogen was isolated in 4 of 6 (67%). conclusions: a high bacteriologic failure rate as well as a considerable clinical failure rate occurred among patients with aom treated with t/s. we believe that t/s is no longer an appropriate empiric choice for the treatment of  aom in regions where high t/s resistance among respiratory pathogens is reported.

TI  == telithromycin: a new ketolide antimicrobial for treatment of respiratory tract infections.
AB  == telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial, specifically developed for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. it has a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against common respiratory pathogens including streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes. it also has activity against atypical pathogens, such as  chlamydia pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. telithromycin maintains activity against beta-lactam and macrolide-resistant respiratory tract pathogens and does not appear to induce cross-resistance to other members of the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (mls) group of antimicrobials. it demonstrates bactericidal activity against s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae and has a prolonged concentration-dependent post-antibiotic effect  (pae) in vitro. the drug has favourable pharmacokinetics following oral administration. it is well absorbed, achieves good plasma levels and is highly concentrated in pulmonary tissues and white blood cells. in clinical trials, telithromycin given orally at a dose of 800 mg once daily for 5 - 10 days was as  effective as comparator antimicrobials for the treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis and group a-beta-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis. the adverse events and safety profile were similar to comparator antimicrobials. the most common adverse events were diarrhoea, nausea, headache and dizziness. telithromycin should provide an effective, convenient and well-tolerated once-daily oral therapy for treatment of respiratory infections.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

TI  == cefdinir: an expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to review the antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of cefdinir, an expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin.  data sources: literature was identified by a medline search (january 1983-november 1999) of the medical literature, review of english-language literature and bibliographies of these articles, and product information. study selection: clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. additional information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir was also reviewed. data synthesis: cefdinir, an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and -positive aerobic organisms,  including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by many common beta-lactamases. cefdinir is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is primarily eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. the terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation  of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia) and skin and skin-structure  infections. the adverse event profile is similar to that of comparator agents. conclusions: cefdinir is a second-line alternative to first-line antimicrobial agents, with convenient once- or twice-daily dosing in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of many beta-lactamases. the clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.

TI  == recombination within natural populations of pathogenic bacteria: short-term empirical estimates and long-term phylogenetic consequences.
AB  == the identification of clones within bacterial populations is often taken as evidence for a low rate of recombination, but the validity of this inference is rarely examined. we have used statistical tests of congruence between gene trees  to examine the extent and significance of recombination in six bacterial pathogens. for neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus, the congruence between the maximum likelihood trees reconstructed using seven house-keeping genes was in most cases  no better than that between each tree and trees of random topology. the lack of congruence between gene trees in these four species, which include both naturally transformable and nontransformable species, is in three cases supported by high ratios of recombination to point mutation during clonal diversification (estimates of this parameter were not possible for strep. pyogenes). in contrast, gene trees constructed for hemophilus influenzae and pathogenic isolates of escherichia coli showed a higher degree of congruence, suggesting lower rates of  recombination. the impact of recombination therefore varies between bacterial species but in many species is sufficient to obliterate the phylogenetic signal in gene trees.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of telithromycin in vitro against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == telithromycin (hmr 3647) is a new ketolide that belongs to a new class of semisynthetic 14-membered-ring macrolides which have expanded activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. the aim of the present study was to investigate different basic pharmacodynamic properties of this new compound. the  following studies of telithromycin were performed: (i) studies of the rate and extent of killing of respiratory tract pathogens with different susceptibilities  to erythromycin and penicillin exposed to a fixed concentration that corresponds  to a dose of 800 mg in humans, (ii) studies of the rate and extent of killing of  telithromycin at five different concentrations, (iii) studies of the rate and extent of killing of the same pathogens at three different inocula, (iv) studies  of the postantibiotic effect and the postantibiotic sub-mic effect of telithromycin, and (v) determination of the rate and extent of killing of telithromycin in an in vitro kinetic model. in conclusion, telithromycin exerted  an extremely fast killing of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae both with static concentrations and in the in vitro kinetic model. a slower killing of the  strains of streptococcus pyogenes was noted, with regrowth in the kinetic model of a macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b-inducible strain. the strains of haemophilus influenzae were not killed at all at a concentration of 0.6 mg/liter  due to high mics. a time-dependent killing was seen for all strains. no inoculum  effect was seen for the strains of s. pneumoniae, with a 99.9% reduction in the numbers of cfu for all inocula at both 8 h and 24 h. the killing of the strains of s. pyogenes was reduced by 1 log(10) cfu at 8 h and 2 to 3 log(10) cfu at 24 h when the two lower inocula were used but not at all at 8 and 24 h when the highest inoculum was used. for both of the h. influenzae strains there was an inoculum effect, with 1 to 2 log(10) cfu less killing for the inoculum of 10(8) cfu/ml in comparison to that for the inoculum of 10(6) cfu/ml. overall, telithromycin exhibited long postantibiotic effects and postantibiotic sub-mic effects for all strains investigated.

TI  == epidemiological survey of bacterial resistance in upper respiratory tract infections in italy.
AB  == the vast majority of infections in the upper airways are caused by four bacterial species;, in italy as elsewhere, antibiotics resistant strains are emerging. enzymatic resistance to beta-lactams in haemophilus influenzae is becoming more important and affects 15% of isolates. on the other hand less than 0.3% of h. influenzae strains are fluoroquinolone-resistant. the number of beta-lactamase-producing moraxella catarrhalis strains in italy has been thought  to be lower than in other countries, but recent studies suggest 90% of strains are positive, a figure similar to figures reported in the international literature. the most recent data estimate high-level resistance to penicillin in  pneumococci to be around 5%, but varies greatly in different geographical areas and with the different origins of the isolates. in spite of the low incidence of  penicillin-resistant strains, the most recent figures for macrolide-resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae range from 26.4 to 31.7%. more than 3 years after the dramatic increase in erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, the resistance levels in italy are still among the highest in the world. unlike the experience in other countries, resistance is often related not to the active efflux of antibiotic from the bacterial cell but to ribosomal methylation, thus affecting not only 14- and 15-membered macrolides, but also 16-membered compounds and lincosamides.

TI  == in vitro comparative dynamics of modified-release clarithromycin and of azithromycin.
AB  == antibacterial kinetics of modified-release clarithromycin (cla) and azithromycin  (azi) against respiratory tract pathogens were compared in relation to their pharmacokinetic profile. the study was carried out in three strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae, respectively, exposed to concentration gradients of cla and azi simulating human serum pharmacokinetics after administration of 500 mg p.o. in a single dose. bactericidal kinetics were  assessed by counting the number of survivors before each change in concentration  over a period of 36 h. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cla and azi were evaluated at time 0 and after 36 h of exposure to antibiotics in the surviving organisms. the results showed that cla and azi, in the experimental conditions adopted, had different antibacterial kinetics. moreover, the addition  of the 14-oh metabolite of cla at the same concentrations reached in human serum  exerted a bactericidal effect against two strains of h. influenzae resistant to cla and azi. an increase in mics was observed against s. pyogenes and h. influenzae, with higher values for azi.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis in taiwan.
AB  == background: over the past decade, resistance of gram-positive cocci to common antibiotics has steadily increased. new antibacterial agents that are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens are urgently needed for the treatment of these pathogens. we conducted an in vitro study on the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics against common clinical isolates  of the gram-positive cocci, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis. methods: the agar dilution method described by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of bacterial isolates from clinical specimens obtained from patients in a medical center. results: all staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin (< or = 2 micrograms/ml). the mic90s were  1 mg/ml for both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s aureus. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited streptococci at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml or less. the mic90s were 1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, s pyogenes and viridans streptococci. ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml, with an mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. h influenzae was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml, with an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. b catarrhalis was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml, with an mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. conclusions: we found that quinupristin/dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against staphylococci, streptococci and b catarrhalis but less in vitro activity against h influenzae.

TI  == bacteriology of the tonsil core in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hyperplasia--a short review.
AB  == in recurrent tonsillitis, the tonsil core harbours numerous bacteria, some of which are pathogenic and may occur in great numbers. the most frequent bacteria are haemophilus influenzae, followed by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a high tissue concentration of these bacteria correlates with clinical  parameters of infection and hyperplasia of the tonsils. the role of streptococcus pyogenes, while undisputed in acute and epidemic tonsillitis, should perhaps be re-evaluated in recurrent and/or hyperplastic tonsillitis.

TI  == [multilocus sequencing--a new method of genotyping bacteria and first results of  its use].
AB  == comparative characterization (molecular typing) of isolates within a bacterial species is one of the major problems in microbiology and epidemiology. however, it is rather difficult to correlate data obtained in various laboratories, because traditional, including molecular, methods employed in typing pathogenic microorganisms cannot be standardized. in 1998, maiden et al. proposed multilocus sequence typing (mlst); through which alleles of several housekeeping genes are directly assessed by nucleotide sequencing, each unique allele combination determining a sequence type of a strain. the advantages of this approach are that the culturing of pathogenic microorganisms is avoided, as their gene fragments are amplified directly from biological samples, and that the sequencing data are  unambiguous, easy to standardize, and electronically portable. the latter makes it possible to generate an expandable global database for each species at an internet site, in order to use it for the purposes of genotyping pathogenic bacteria (and other infectious agents). mlst protocols have been elaborated for neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and helicobacter pylori; those  for streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus influenzae are now being developed. basic principles and the first results of mlst have been reviewed, including data on the distribution and microevolution of n. meningitidis clones causing epidemic meningococcal infection, the relative recombination and mutation rates in the n. meningitidis genome, the identification of antibiotic-resistant s. pneumoniae clones causing severe generalized infection, the grouping of h. pylori isolates from various geographic regions, etc.

AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate against respiratory pathogens.
AB  == after 30 years of therapeutic use, thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate (cas  20192-91-0) is still widely employed in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. this is due to its particular characteristic to exert at pulmonary level, either the antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol (cas 15318-45-3) and the mucolytic activity of n-acetylcysteine (cas 616-91-1). the aim of this study was to evaluate the present pattern of susceptibility of several clinical isolates to thiamphenicol and the interference of n-acetylcysteine on this parameter. the studies have been performed in vitro. equimolar concentrations of n-acetylcysteine and even higher concentrations did not interfere with the antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae. the  spectrum of activity of thiamphenicol was similar to that observed in the past and was superior to that of erythromycin and amoxicillin. the activity of thiamphenicol was greater than that of erythromycin against h. influenzae and streptococci and equivalent versus branhamella catarrhalis. in comparison with amoxicillin the activity of thiamphenicol was higher against h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis and slightly lower against streptococci. the results demonstrate that thiamphenicol maintains its therapeutic value confirming the importance of thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == comparison of the in vitro activity of and pathogen responses to sparfloxacin with those of other agents in the treatment of respiratory tract, urinary tract,  and skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of and pathogen responses to sparfloxacin were compared with those of standard therapies for the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated skin or skin-structure infections, urinary tract infections, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and acute maxillary sinusitis in 7 multicenter controlled trials in north america. sparfloxacin was administered orally as a 400-mg loading dose followed by 200 mg once daily for up to 10 days. the bacteriologic efficacy of sparfloxacin (84% to 95%) was comparable to that of comparator drugs (77% to 100%). sparfloxacin was generally 2 to 8 times more active (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains tested [mic90]: 0.03 to 0.5 microg/ml) than comparators against common pathogens isolated in community-acquired infections, especially streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains; moraxella catarrhalis; haemophilus influenzae; streptococcus pyogenes; and staphylococcus aureus. sparfloxacin was also effective against chlamydia and mycoplasma species. the emergence of resistance was uncommon during sparfloxacin  therapy (0.3% of 1100 cases). higher area under the plasma concentration-time curve/mic and maximum plasma concentration/mic ratios for sparfloxacin were associated with clinical and bacteriologic efficacy, whereas lower ratios were associated with clinical and bacteriologic failure. the clinical efficacy of sparfloxacin (80% to 95%) was comparable to that obtained with the comparator drugs (71% to 92%). in addition, sparfloxacin was well tolerated and had an overall frequency of related adverse events similar to that of the comparators. there was a higher frequency of photosensitivity reactions but a lower level of digestive adverse events with sparfloxacin compared with comparators. sparfloxacin is a suitable therapeutic alternative for the empiric treatment of respiratory tract infections owing to its favorable pharmacokinetic profile and activity against typical and atypical respiratory tract pathogens, even in geographic areas with a high incidence of penicillin resistance.

TI  == bactericidal properties of moxifloxacin and post-antibiotic effect.
AB  == the time-kill kinetics and post-antibiotic effect (pae) of moxifloxacin were studied for strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. moxifloxacin  had a bactericidal effect against all strains tested, with the least rapid bactericidal effect being against s. pyogenes and the most rapid effect against s. aureus and e. coli. the pae of moxifloxacin was similar to that of other fluoroquinolones and increased with increasing concentration. no association was  found between the bactericidal effect of moxifloxacin and the duration of pae. gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were also exposed to concentrations of  moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and amoxycillin that simulated the drug concentrations obtained in human serum after standard oral dosing schedules. simulation of moxifloxacin concentrations in human serum reduced viable counts more effectively and more rapidly than shown in time-kill experiments; in contrast, sparfloxacin and amoxycillin were less effective than when constant concentrations of these antibacterials were used.

TI  == dynamics of interleukin-1 production in middle ear fluid during acute otitis media treated with antibiotics.
AB  == in an ongoing prospective study, il-1 concentrations were measured in 78 children (aged 3-36 months) with acute otitis media receiving antibiotics. middle ear fluid il-1 concentrations were determined using elisa kits. ninety-eight middle ear fluid samples were obtained by tympanocentesis at enrollment (day 1) and 43 samples were collected on days 4-5. ninety-two pathogens were isolated in 77/98 samples obtained on day 1: 55 haemophilus influenzae, 34 streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 moraxella catarrhalis and 1 streptococcus pyogenes. among 37 paired samples initially culture-positive, eradication of the pathogen was achieved on day 4-5 in 20 while pathogens were still present in 17. on day 1, il-1 was detected in 61/77 (79%) culture-positive samples vs 9/21 (43%) culture-negative ones (p = 0.003). the mean +/- sd middle ear fluid concentration of il-1 on day 1 was significantly higher in culture-positive (316 +/- 508 pg/ml) than in culture-negative samples (111 +/- 245 pg/ml) (p = 0.01). when paired samples were evaluated, il-1 decreased on days 4-5 in 13/20 (65%) ears where bacterial eradication was achieved, but also in 11/19 (58%) with persistent or new infection. the mean il-1 concentrations decreased on days 4-5 in the 20 samples from ears where bacterial eradication was achieved (330 +/- 460 vs 118 +/- 294 pg/ml, p = 0.1) but also in the 17 samples where it was not (465 +/- 660 vs 232 +/- 289 pg/ml, p = 0.02). no significant differences were found between day 1 and days 4-5 in the mean il-1 concentrations measured in patients with h. influenzae  vs s. pneumoniae or concomitant h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae. it was concluded that: 1) il-1 was detected in the middle ear fluid of most patients with acute otitis media; 2) significantly higher il-1 concentrations were found in patients  with culture-positive than in those with culture-negative acute otits media; 3) il-1 concentrations decreased on days 4-5 of antibiotic therapy, whether the pathogen was eradicated or not.

TI  == in vitro activities of macrolides against gram-positive aerobes, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and bacteroides fragilis in taiwan.
AB  == background: new macrolides with improved pharmacokinetic characteristics have been developed and introduced for clinical use in taiwan. in order to understand  the antibacterial activities of these new macrolides, we tested their in vitro activities against common pathogenic bacteria. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin for clinical isolates collected from six teaching  hospitals in taiwan were determined by the agar dilution method. the tested bacteria included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus spp, corynebacterium spp, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and bacteroides fragilis. results: high mics were detected against most of the bacteria tested except for h influenzae and m catarrhalis. the mic90  for viridans streptococci, s pneumoniae, s pyogenes, enterococcus spp, s aureus (both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant), coryne-bacterium spp, and b fragilis were all at least 128 micrograms/ml. wide ranges of mics were demonstrated. conclusions: most bacteria tested were highly resistant to macrolides. this result is a warning for clinicians that rational use of antibiotics, including macrolides, is mandatory.

TI  == the role of newer macrolides in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection. a review of experimental and clinical data.
AB  == the macrolide class of antibiotics is well established and often recommended for  use in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection (rti). the newer agents clarithromycin and azithromycin are frequently prescribed as first-  or second-line therapy, and have been considered as superior to erythromycin in microbiological activity and clinical efficacy. in-vitro data show that clarithromycin and azithromycin have good activity (mic < or = 0.5 microg/ml) against certain rti pathogens. however the activity of both compounds is intrinsically low against haemophilus influenzae whilst several other important rti pathogens - notably streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes - exhibit a high prevalence of resistance to them. in many countries, the prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin and azithromycin is still rising with  cross resistance with erythromycin. maximum serum concentrations of clarithromycin and azithromycin are lower than the mic90s for these agents against h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae. concentrations in tissues have been reported to be much higher than those in serum. however, the high concentrations  observed in tissues are largely a reflection of high concentrations inside cells. concentrations of clarithromycin and azithromycin in extracellular tissue fluids, where haemophilus and streptococci are located, are in equilibrium with concentrations in the serum, and remain low. it has been suggested that phagocytes deliver azithromycin to infection sites in a targeted fashion, but the evidence in support of this hypothesis is weak. recent clinical experience with clarithromycin and azithromycin is consistent with preclinical results, and suggests that these agents have limited efficacy against certain respiratory infections. clarithromycin and azithromycin are the first choice treatment of atypical infections caused by intracellular pathogens. for community-acquired rtis, where h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae are present, they may no longer be an appropriate choice for first-line therapy. indeed, in areas where levels of drug  resistant s. pneumoniae are high, their use may be questionable as second-line therapy.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == microbiology of bacterial respiratory infections.
AB  == the upper respiratory tract may become susceptible to bacterial infection as a result of health conditions such as allergies and viral infections, as well as the effects of smoking and airborne environmental pollutants. streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis are the most common  bacterial pathogens in upper and lower respiratory tract infections. streptococcus pyogenes is the predominant bacterial pathogen in pharyngitis and tonsillitis. bacterial pathogens adhere to mucous membranes and colonization ensues. in an otherwise healthy individual the host immune system responds to the invading bacteria resulting in edema and swelling. if antimicrobial treatment does not eradicate the invading organisms and successfully interrupt the progress of the infection, the patient may develop recurrent or chronic disease. s. pneumoniae and other pathogens once susceptible to penicillin and other antibiotics are now becoming resistant. bacterial resistance has developed and disseminated because of the widespread use of antibiotics. major mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in upper respiratory tract infections include enzymatic inhibition, membrane impermeability, alteration of target enzymes, active pumping out of antibiotic and alteration of the ribosomal target.

TI  == microbiology of acute otitis media in costa rican children.
AB  == background: because of the increasing number of resistant middle ear pathogens reported from different centers worldwide, an active surveillance of the microbiology and susceptibility pattern of middle ear pathogens is required for proper antimicrobial recommendations among different regions of the world. objective: to study the microbiology and susceptibility pattern of middle ear pathogens obtained from costa rican children with acute otitis media. methods: between 1992 and 1997 a diagnostic tympanocentesis was performed in 398 costa rican patients with acute otitis media. middle ear fluid was obtained for culture and minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the e-test technique in  those isolates obtained between october, 1995, and january, 1997. results: the most common pathogens cultured were streptococcus pneumoniae (30%), haemophilus influenzae (14%), staphylococcus aureus (4%) and streptococcus pyogenes (4%). moraxella catarrhalis was uncommon. beta-lactamase production was low (3.7%) among the h. influenzae isolates but frequent among the staphylococcus aureus (57.1%) and m. catarrhalis (100%) strains. overall 9 of 46 s. pneumoniae isolates (19.6%) exhibited decreased susceptibility to penicillin of which 8 isolates (17.4%) showed intermediate and one strain (2.2%) high level resistance. among the penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to the following antimicrobials was: 81%, azithromycin; 89%, clarithromycin; and 100%, ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx). among the penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates the percentage of susceptible strains was 89% for azithromycin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone and 67% for tmp-smx. conclusions: based on this microbiologic information the agents considered first  line drugs in the treatment of acute otitis media in costa rica remain amoxicillin or tmp-smx.

TI  == azithromycin. a review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  == azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella spp., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. in children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. these standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. however, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. conclusions: azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents  in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.

TI  == aetiology of acute epiglottitis in adults.
AB  == in order to determine the aetiology of acute epiglottitis in adults, blood cultures, paired sera and a urine sample were obtained from 54 patients with fever and epiglottitis visualized by indirect laryngoscopy or by direct fibreoptic nasolaryngoscopy. antibodies were determined against the capsular polysaccharide of haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), 3 pneumococcal antigens (a mixture of 23 capsular polysaccharides, c-polysaccharide and pneumolysin) and antistreptolysin o. acute sera were examined by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for dna of hib and pneumococci. the urine samples were examined for hib capsular antigen. blood cultures were positive in 15 patients. in another 16, serology and/or pcr verified the aetiology. hib was the cause in 14, pneumococci  in 12 and group a streptococci in 5 patients. the aetiology remained unknown in 23/54 patients (43%). in conclusion, the addition of serology and pcr to blood cultures doubled the possibilities of verifying the aetiology of acute epiglottitis in adults.

TI  == cytoplasmic membrane lipoprotein lppc of streptococcus equisimilis functions as an acid phosphatase.
AB  == the function of the streptococcal cytoplasmic membrane lipoprotein, lppc, was identified with isogenic streptococcus equisimilis h46a and escherichia coli jm109 strain pairs differing in whether they contained [h46a and jm109(plpp2)] or lacked (h46a lppc::plpp10 and jm109) the functional lppc gene for comparative phosphatase determinations under acidic conditions. lppc-directed acid phosphatase activity was demonstrated zymographically and by specific enzymatic activity assays, with whole cells or cell membrane preparations as enzyme sources. lppc acid phosphatase showed optimum activity at ph 5, and the enzyme activity was unaffected by triton x-100, l-(+)-tartaric acid, or edta. database searches revealed significant structural homology of lppc to the streptococcus pyogenes lppa, flavobacterium meningosepticum opla, helicobacter pylori hp1285, and haemophilus influenzae hel [e (p4)] proteins. these results suggest a possible function for these proteins and establish a novel function of streptococcal cell membrane lipoproteins.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of macrolides against clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of 6 macrolides was determined using a micro-broth dilution method, against 535 clinical isolates of 22 species, which were isolated in 1996 from 325 facilities in japan. results were as follows. 1. in general, antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were higher than those of 16-membered macrolides. the antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were in the order of clarithromycin (cam), erythromycin (em), roxithromycin (rxm). among 16-membered macrolides, rokitamycin (rkm) was the most potent, josamycin (jm) was next potent followed by midecamycin (mdm). more numbers of highly-resistant strain of > 100 micrograms/ml were recognized in 14-membered macrolides than in 16-membered macrorides. 2. most of s. pyogenes (group a) strains were distributed in the susceptible range and almost none was found in the resistant range. 3. s. pneumoniae strains were distributed widely from the susceptible range to the highly resistant range, and as high as 37.1% fell into the high resistance of > 100 micrograms/ml range. 4. against peptostreptococcus spp. and mrsa, 16-membered macrolides were more effective than 14-membered macrorlides, and their antibacterial activities were in the order of rkm, jm, mdm. ratio of high-resistant strains of > 100 micrograms/ml against 14-membered macrolides was much higher than that against 16-membered macrolies. 5. most of m. (b.) catarrhalis strains were distributed in the susceptible range of < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml, and most of h. influenzae strains were distributed within the moderately resistant and the resistant ranges. 6. in m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae, no correlation between macrolide resistance and beta-lactamase production was recognized. 7. most of c. jejuni strains were susceptible to all macrolides used in this study.

TI  == in-vitro activity of piperacillin and tazobactam combination against clinically significant bacteria.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactum which is not among the routinely tested antibiotic at the public health bacteriology laboratory, parirenyatwa hospital, harare, zimbabwe was evaluated for its activity against bacterial pathogens using the kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. piperacillin/tazobactum showed superior in-vitro activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria when compared with routinely tested antibiotics such as gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, penicillin, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and clindamycin and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). ciprofloxacin showed in-vitro activity comparable to that of tazobactam/piperacillin. specifically, 96% of gram positive isolates (comprising  streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam. for gram  negative organisms, 98% of haemophilus influenzae shigella spp, klebsiella spp were also sensitive to the combination. the broad spectrum of activity of piperacillin/tazobactam shows that the potential of the drug combination for the  treatment of infections caused by diverse microorganisms should not be underestimated. we recommend its inclusion in routine antibiotic sensitivity testing in our hospital.

TI  == anhydrolide macrolides. 1. synthesis and antibacterial activity of 2,3-anhydro-6-o-methyl 11,12-carbamate erythromycin a analogues.
AB  == a series of 3-descladinosyl-2,3-anhydro-6-o-methylerythromycin a 11, 12-carbamate analogues have been synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. these compounds were found to be potent antibacterial agents against gram-positive organisms in vitro, many having mic values below 1 microg/ml for the macrolide-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as improved activity compared to erythromycin a against the inducibly mls (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b)-resistant organisms. structure-activity studies revealed that arylalkyl carbamates with two and four carbon atoms between the aromatic moiety and carbamate nitrogen have the best in vitro activity. all of the c-10 epi analogues evaluated were found to have substantially less activity than the corresponding natural c-10 isomer. several analogues demonstrated moderate antibacterial activity against the constitutively resistant s.aureus a-5278, s. pneumoniae5979, and s.pyogenes 930.  however, despite potent in vitro activity, these analogues showed only moderate in vivo activity in mouse protection studies.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 gram-negative and 498 gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. the activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate,  ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against citrobacter diversus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, serratia  marcescens, staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, group g streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. the reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. the commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. there was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing enterobacter agglomerans and e. cloacae, where  the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher mic90 value.

TI  == cloning and expression of staphylococcus aureus and treptococcus pyogenes murd genes encoding uridine diphosphate n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine:d-glutamate ligases.
AB  == bacterial udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine:d-glutamate ligase (murd), a cytoplasmic  peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzyme, catalyzes the atp-dependent addition of d-glutamate to an alanyl residue of the udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine precursor,  generating the dipeptide. the murd gene was cloned from both staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. sequence analysis of the s. aureus murd gene revealed an open reading frame of 449 amino acids. the deduced aa sequence of s.  aureus murd is highly homologous to murd from escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, bacillus subtilis and st. pyogenes. recombinant murd protein from both s. aureus and st. pyogenes was separately overproduced in e. coli and purified as his-tagged fusion. both recombinant enzymes catalyzed the atp-dependent addition of d-glutamate to the precursor sugar peptide.

TI  == bacteria and viruses that cause respiratory tract infections during the pilgrimage (haj) season in makkah, saudi arabia.
AB  == objective: to determine the incidence and type of rti-causing bacteria and viruses during a period of epidemic infections. method: a total of 395 sputum specimens and 761 throat swabs were collected during the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons (haj to makkah al-mukarama, saudi arabia) from patients referred to one hospital and three dispensaries with symptoms of respiratory tract infections. all 761 throat swabs of both haj seasons were also screened for the presence of viral pathogens with monoclonal antibodies specific for 7 viruses known to cause  respiratory infections. results: bacterial pathogens were detected in 118 (29.9%) specimens. during the 1991 haj season haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent bacterial pathogen detected (10%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (5.2%), streptococcus pneumoniae (4.8%), staphylococcus aureus (3.8%) and streptococcus pyogenes (2.4%). in the 1992 haj season klebsiella pneumoniae was predominant (15.1%), followed by haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae (12.3%). screening of all sputum specimens for acid-fast bacteria showed that the overall incidence rate of tuberculosis was 1%. cultures from the  761 throat swabs were largely negative for bacteria except for streptococcus pyogenes isolated from 7 patients. viruses were detected in 148 (19.5%) specimens with influenza a and adenovirus being the most common viruses. conclusion: the pattern of virus prevalence in the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons was identical: influenza a and adenovirus predominated. thus these two viruses should be targeted in future prophylactic measures.

AB  == in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a  total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against  e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for  this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == studies of the killing kinetics of benzylpenicillin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, and sparfloxacin on bacteria in the postantibiotic phase.
AB  == most antibiotics are known to be incapable of killing nongrowing or slowly growing bacteria with few exceptions. bacterial cell division is inhibited during the postantibiotic phase (pa phase) after short exposure to antibiotics. only scarce and conflicting data are available concerning the ability of antibiotics to kill bacteria in the pa phase. the aim of the present study was to investigate the killing effect of four different antibiotics on bacteria in the pa phase. a postantibiotic effect (pae) was induced by exposing streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae to 10x mics of benzylpenicillin, cefuroxime, sparfloxacin, and azithromycin. the bacteria were thereafter reexposed to a 10x mic of the same antibiotic used for the induction of the pae at the beginning of and after 2 and  4 h in the pa phase. due to a very long pae, the bacteria in pa phase induced by  azithromycin were also exposed to 10x mics after 6 and 8 h. a previously unexposed culture exposed to a 10x mic was used as a control. the results seem to be dependent on both the antibiotic used and the bacterial species. the antibiotics exhibiting a fork bactericidal action gave significantly reduced killing of the bacteria in pa phase (cefuroxime with s. pyogenes, p < 0.01, and sparfloxacin with h. influenzae, p < 0.001), which was restored at 4 h for cefuroxime with s. pyogenes. there was a tendency to restoration of the bactericidal activity also with sparfloxacin and h. influenzae, but there was still a significant difference in killing between the control and the test bacteria in pa phase at 4 h. however, in the combinations with a lesser bactericidal effect (benzylpenicillin with s. pyogenes and sparfloxacin with s. pyogenes), there was no difference in killing between the control and the test bacteria in pa phase. azithromycin induced long paes in both s. pyogenes and h. influenzae and exhibited a slower bactericidal action on both the control and the bacteria in pa phase especially at the end of the pae, when the killing was almost bacteriostatic. our findings in this study support the concept that a long interval (> 12 h) between doses of azithromycin, restoring full bactericidal action, may be beneficial to optimize efficacy of this drug but is not necessary  for the other antibiotics evaluated, since the bactericidal effect seems to be restored already at 4 h.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of ru 64004, a new ketolide, was evaluated against more than 600 bacterial strains and was compared with those of various macrolides and pristinamycin. ru 64004 had good activity against multiresistant pneumococci, whether they were erythromycin a resistant or not, including penicillin-resistant strains. ru 64004 inhibited 90% of pneumococci resistant to erythromycin a and penicillin g at 0.6 and 0.15 microg/ml, respectively. unlike macrolides, ru 64004 did not induce the phenotype of resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b. its good antibacterial activity against  multiresistant pneumococci ran in parallel with its well-balanced activity against all bacteria involved in respiratory infections (e.g., haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes). in contrast to all comparators (14- and 16-membered-ring macrolides and pristinamycin), ru 64004 displayed high therapeutic activity in animals infected with all major strains, irrespective of the phenotypes of the strains. the results suggest that ru 64004  has potential for use in the treatment of infections caused by respiratory pathogens including multiresistant pneumococci.

TI  == ceftibuten: a new expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to review the antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of ceftibuten, a new expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: literature was identified by a medline search (january 1983-june 1996) of the medical literature, review of english-language literature and bibliographies of these articles, and data on file. study selection: clinical efficacy data were selected from all published and unpublished trials and abstracts that mentioned ceftibuten. additional information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and pharmacokinetic profile of ceftibuten also was reviewed. data synthesis: ceftibuten, an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and selected gram-positive organisms, including streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae. ceftibuten is stable to hydrolysis by many common beta-lactamases. ceftibuten is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is primarily eliminated renally as unchanged  drug. the elimination half-life of ceftibuten is slightly longer than 2 hours. efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis) and urinary tract infections. the adverse effect profile is equal to that of comparator agents. conclusions: ceftibuten is an alternative to other antimicrobial agents with convenient once-daily dosing in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, ceftibuten has antimicrobial activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and  is stable in the presence of many beta-lactamases. the clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.

TI  == [clinical efficacy in pediatrics sinusitis infections of cefditoren pivoxil granule therapy and its in vitro antibacterial activity against clinically isolated strains].
AB  == we investigated the clinical efficacy in pediatrics sinusitis infections of cefditoren pivoxil granule therapy and its in vitro antibacterial activity against clinically isolated strains. the results are summarized as follows. the specimens from 343 patients were cultured and 595 strains of bacteria were isolated and identified. oral doses of 3 and 5 mg/kg of cdtr-pi were clinically effective at high percentages, 85.1% and 89.5%, respectively, of treated patients. cdtr-pi at 3 mg/kg orally was clinically effective in 80.8% of patients with pcg intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) infections, 80.0% of those with pcg susceptible s. pneumoniae (pssp) infections, 81.8% of those with h. influenzae infections and 78.3% of those with m. (b.) catarrhalis infections among the infections by major causative agents. the frequent isolates included s. pneumoniae accounting for 33.1%, h. influenzae accounting for 32.1%, m. (b.) catarrhalis accounting for 17.6% and s. pyogenes accounting 3.7% of all the isolates. pisp accounted for 16.1% of all the isolates and for 49.8% of the isolates of s. pneumoniae, and were isolated from 28.6% of the 343 patients. the  isolation of pisp was frequent from children of 4 and under especially, and especially frequent from those below age 2. of the isolates of s. pneumoniae, the biotype frequencies among pssp were in the order of type i > type ii > type iii,  while those among pisp were in the order of type i < type ii with none of type iii. bacteriologically, an eradication rate of 89.4% was achieved with 3 mg/kg and 93.5% with 5 mg/kg of cdtr-pi.

TI  == [beta-hemolytic streptococci in tonsil hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis].
AB  == background: the recurrence of streptococci acute tonsillitis is a complication that often motivates the tonsillectomy. we studied the colonisation of tonsils and adenoids by s. pyogenes and other beta haemolytic streptococci in both surgical indications, recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy. methods: we made for aerobic culture the following specimens, throat swabs, tonsils and adenoids tissue corresponding to 47 children referred for tonsillectomy. results: s. pyogenes was isolated in 11 cases (23.4%) of tonsils and other beta haemolytic non a streptococci was isolated in 11 cases, of them, group c streptococci was the most frequent with six cases. however in the recurrent tonsillitis group, s.  pyogenes was isolated more significantly (47%) that other beta haemolytic streptococci (5.8%). otherwise in the tonsilar hypertrophy group, s. pyogenes was isolated in the 10% while that other streptococci was isolated in the 33.3%. the  culture of 38 adenoids yielded s. pyogenes and beta haemolytic group c streptococci in 6 cases each one (15.7%). conclusions: s. pyogenes was isolated more frequently in recurrent tonsillitis that other micro-organisms while that in the tonsilar hypertrophy group predominated streptococci beta haemolytic non a, s. aureus and h. influenzae. is of interest that the adenoids in our study showed an important reservoir of beta haemolytic streptococci. the throats swabs yielded less of the half of all beta haemolytic streptococci isolated in tonsilar tissue  cultured.

TI  == the lppc gene of streptococcus equisimilis encodes a lipoprotein that is homologous to the e (p4) outer membrane protein from haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == we report the cloning, sequencing, and analysis of a novel chromosomal gene of streptococcus equisimilis strain h46a that codes for a membrane lipoprotein, designated lppc. the lppc gene is located 3' adjacent to, and co-oriented with, the unrelated gapc gene that encodes the previously characterized glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. sequencing of lppc revealed an 855-bp open reading frame that predicted a 32.4-kda polypeptide possessing a potential lipoprotein signal sequence and modification site (vtgc). signal sequence processing of lppc synthesized in the homologous host or expressed from plasmid plpp2 in escherichia coli was sensitive to globomycin, a selective inhibitor of lipoprotein-specific signal peptidase ii. subcellular localization of lppc using  polyclonal antibodies raised to the hexahistidyl-tagged protein proved lppc to be tightly associated with the cytoplasmic membrane of s. equisimilis and with the outer membrane of e. coli jm109 (plpp2). southern, northern and western analyses  indicated that lpp was conserved in s. pyogenes, and transcribed independently of gap as monocistronic 0.9-kb mrna from a sigma 70-like consensus promoter. database searches found homology of lppc to the hel gene-encoded outer membrane protein e (p4) from haemophilus influenzae to which it exhibits 58% sequence similarity. however, unlike the hel gene, lppc was unable to complement hema mutants of e. coli for growth on hemin as sole porphyrin source in aerobic conditions. furthermore, neither the wild type nor an lppc insertion mutant of s. equisimilis could grow on hemin in iron-limited medium. these results, together with findings indicating that s. equisimilis h46a had no absolute requirement for iron, led us to conclude that lppc, in contrast to hel, is not involved in hemin  utilization and has yet to be assigned a function.

TI  == in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) was very active against gram-negative species examined  including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, legionella spp., neisseria spp. and escherichia coli (mic90s < or = 0.03 mg/l). in general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative species. trovafloxacin was active against gram-positive organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90s < or = 0.25  mg/l). against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. in addition, chlamydia  spp., mycoplasma spp. and ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. these in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.

TI  == clarithromycin. a review of its efficacy in the treatment of respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients.
AB  == clarithromycin is a broad spectrum macrolide antibacterial agent active in vitro  and effective in vivo against the major pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients. it is highly active in vitro against pathogens causing atypical pneumonia (chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae and legionella spp.) and has similar activity to other macrolides against staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis and  streptococcus pneumoniae. haemophilus influenzae is susceptible or intermediately susceptible to clarithromycin alone, but activity is enhanced when the parent drug and metabolite are combined in vitro. absorption of clarithromycin is unaffected by food. more than half of an oral dose is systemically available as the parent drug and the active 14-hydroxy metabolite. pharmacokinetics are nonlinear, with plasma concentrations increasing in more than proportion to the dosage. first-pass metabolism results in the rapid appearance of the active metabolite 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin in plasma. clarithromycin and its active metabolite are found in greater concentrations in the tissues and fluids of the respiratory tract than in plasma. dosage adjustments are required for patients with severe renal failure, but not for elderly patients or those with hepatic impairment. drug interactions related to the cytochrome p450 system may occur with clarithromycin use. in addition to the standard immediate-release formulation for administration twice daily, a modified-release formulation of clarithromycin is now available for use once daily. in dosages of 500 to 1000 mg/day for 5 to 14 days, clarithromycin was as effective in the treatment of community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections in hospital and community settings as beta-lactam agents (with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor), cephalosporins and most other macrolides. clarithromycin was similar  in efficacy to azithromycin in comparative studies and is as effective as and better tolerated than erythromycin. adverse events are primarily gastrointestinal in nature, but result in fewer withdrawals from therapy than are seen with erythromycin. clarithromycin provides similar clinical and bacteriological efficacy to that seen with beta-lactam agents, cephalosporins and other macrolides. it offers a cost-saving alternative to intravenous erythromycin use in us hospitals and is available in both once-daily and twice-daily formulations. the spectrum of activity of clarithromycin against common and emerging respiratory tract pathogens may make it suitable for use in the community as empirical therapy of respiratory tract infections in both children and adults.

TI  == causative pathogens, antibiotic resistance and therapeutic considerations in acute otitis media.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis are the most frequently isolated pathogens in patients with acute otitis media (aom). other potential causative pathogens include streptococcus pyogenes in older children and chlamydia pneumoniae in younger children. the recent emergence of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and the increasing frequency of beta-lactamase-producing strains of m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae are creating concerns regarding the use of amoxicillin as traditional first line empiric therapy for aom in younger children. both the in vitro antibiotic activity against these more resistant causative pathogens and the antibiotic concentrations achieved in middle ear fluid must be considered when selecting antibiotics for treatment of refractory aom. the newer macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin, provide reasonable in vitro coverage against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae, although azithromycin is more active against the latter. both drugs also achieve  notably higher, sustained concentrations in middle ear fluid than do beta-lactam  antibiotics. thus the newer macrolides represent important new rational alternatives for the management of aom.

TI  == history of macrolide use in pediatrics.
AB  == erythromycin, the prototypical macrolide, has been widely used since the 1950s in the management of pediatric infections. erythromycin is the drug of choice for infants and children with legionnaire's disease, pertussis, diphtheria, lower respiratory tract infections caused by mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and chlamydia trachomatis and enteritis caused by campylobacter jejuni. it is also indicated for treatment of syphilis; for streptococcal, staphylococcal and pneumococcal infections; genital infections caused by ureaplasma urealyticum; and for the prevention of rheumatic fever and endocarditis in patients who are allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics. the new macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are also active against borrelia burgdorferi, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, cryptosporidium spp. and toxoplasma gondii. erythromycin is associated with a low risk of serious side effects, although gastric distress occurs in a significant proportion of patients. drug interactions with theophylline, carbamazepine, warfarin, cyclosporine, terfenadine and digoxin limit erythromycin use. the newer macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are more stable, better absorbed and better tolerated than erythromycin. azithromycin is more active than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae. excellent tissue and intracellular penetration may contribute to their clinical efficacy. in children both azithromycin and clarithromycin are indicated for acute otitis media caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis and for pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by streptococcus pyogenes. (as of december, 1996,  azithromycin for oral suspension was approved for community-acquired pneumonia in children caused by c. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, m. pneumoniae and s. pneumoniae.) claritromycin is also indicated for acute maxillary sinusitis, uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, pneumonia and disseminated mycobacterial infections. azithromycin and clarithromycin are associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, a low rate of drug discontinuation caused by side effects and a low potential for interaction with other drugs.

AB  == azithromycin (azm), a new oral macrolide antibiotic, in 10% fine granules or 100  mg capsules was given to pediatric patients to treat various infections. the following results were obtained in our studies of azm for its antibacterial activities against clinical isolates, its pharmacokinetics, its efficacy, and its safety. 1. mics of azm, erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin (cam) were determined against a total of 57 strains all at 10(6) cfu/ml. among gram-positive cocci, mics of azm ranged from 0.78 to > 100 micrograms/ml against staphylococcus aureus (20 strains), from 0.05 to 0.1 microgram/ml against streptococcus pyogenes (11 strains), and from 0.0125 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains). these mics were similar to those of the other macrolides. among gram-negative bacilli, mics of azm were 0.05 micrograms/ml against moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (1 strain), from 0.78 to 3.13  micrograms/ml against haemophilus influenzae (9 strains), 0.78 micrograms/ml against haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 strain) and 6.25 micrograms/ml against salmonella sp. (1 strain). these values were similar to or lower than those of the other macrolides. against mycoplasma pneumoniae, mics of azm were < or = 0.0008 micrograms/ml in three strains. one strain of m. pneumoniae showed tolerance to azm at mic 25 micrograms/ml. the other agents exhibited higher mic than azm against this organism. 2. plasma samples were collected from five patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules for drug level determination. the patients received azm at 10.0 approximately 16.3 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days. drug concentrations in plasma at two hours after day 3 dosing were in a range between 0.02 and 0.19 micrograms/ml for fine granules and were in a range between 0.11 and 0.42 micrograms/ml for capsules. 3. urine samples were collected from four patients receiving fine granules and four  patients receiving capsules. drug levels were determined to be 3 micrograms/ml at post-treatment 48 hours for fine granules and post-treatment 72 hours for capsules. urinary excretion rates of azm in three patients on capsules lied in a  range between 4.69 and 10.17%. 4. effectiveness of azm in fine granules was evaluated in 128 patients having a total of 19 different infections. azm was rated "excellent" in 51 patients, "good" in 63, "fair" in 8, "poor" in 6, resulting in an efficacy rate of 89.1%. effectiveness of azm in capsular form was evaluated in 23 patients with five different infections. azm was found "excellent" in 13 patients and "good" in 10, resulting in an efficacy rate of 100%. 5. azm in fine granules eradicated 45 strains of 54 in 8 different bacteria. azm in capsules eradicated 9 strains of 10 strains in 6 different bacteria. 6. as for adverse reactions, one patient complained of eruption, one vomiting, one loose stool, five diarrhea, when administered with fine granular form of azm. one patient on azm capsules experienced urticaria and vomiting. 7. as for abnormal laboratory changes, three patients were found with decreased wbc, seven with increased eosinophil, two with increased got and gpt, one with increased gpt. they were all on fine granular form of azm. as far as abnormalities found in patients administered with azm in capsular form, two showed decreased wbc, one decreased wbc along with increased eosinophil, and three increased eosinophil.

AB  == a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of an immunostimulant, ribomunyl, in the prevention of recurrences of infectious rhinitis in adults. this trial involved 327 patients (168 ribomunyl treated and 159 placebo cases) with an average of 4.3 +/- 1.8 rhinitis episodes per patient recorded during the year preceding the study. the main criterion of efficacy was the cumulative number of recurrences of infectious rhinitis during a 6-month follow-up period, as analyzed by standard tests. an additional analysis of relative risk of recurrences used multivariate failure for time data. ribomunyl was effective throughout the study period, starting from the first month of treatment: a mean of 1.0 +/- 1.1 recurrences was recorded in the ribomunyl group as compared to 1.5 +/- 1.4 recurrences in the placebo group; this indicated one-third fewer infections (p = 0.001). the protective effect of ribomunyl on the relative risk for recurrences was estimated to be 0.58 by multivariate analysis (95% ci: 0.43-0.78, p = 0.0001). analysis of secondary criteria also favored ribomunyl: 38.5% less antibiotic courses per patient (0.8 +/- 1.3 vs 1.3 +/- 1.6; p = 0.002) and the number of days with antibiotics (5.6 +/- 9.3 vs 9.1 +/- 12.1; p = 0.002).

TI  == do simple laboratory tests help in etiologic diagnosis in acute maxillary sinusitis?
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the results of such simple hematologic tests as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), white blood cell count (wbc) and c-reactive protein (crp) could give any useful information about the causative agents in 176 patients with acute maxillary sinusitis (ams). the great  majority of tests (82%) showed values which were within normal limits. this may be due to the fact that 22% of ams cases were culture negative for bacteria and about 60% of culture positive cases had haemophilus influenzae as the etiologic agent. significantly raised test values were seen in connection with streptococcus pyogenes in the majority of cases, less frequently with streptococcus pneumoniae and rarely with haemophilus influenzae. we conclude that none of the evaluated routine blood tests are particularly sensitive indicators of the specific etiology of ams in general. however, elevated crp values (> 40 mg/l) associated with ams should alert the physician to the suspicion of streptococcus pyogenes or streptococcus pneumoniae in etiology, since both, if left untreated, may lead to sinus empyema. with crp or other evaluated tests haemophilus influenzae- or branhamella catarrhalis-positive ams cannot be distinguished from a purely viral disease.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == [therapeutic efficacy of azithromycin in pediatrics].
AB  == azithromycin (azm), a newly developed azalide antibiotic, was administered at a standard dose of 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 days to pediatric patients with bacterial infections and the therapeutic efficacy of azm was investigated. 1. a total of 12 patients with the following diseases was evaluated: pharyngitis in two, tonsillitis in four, bronchitis in one, mycoplasma pneumonia in one, scarlet fever in two and enteritis in two. the drug was rated "excellent" in eight cases  and "good" in four. 2. eleven strains were isolated from patients: five strains of streptococcus pyogenes, four strains of haemophilus influenzae, and two strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae. isolated bacteria were eradicated in eight strains and persisting in one, resulting in 88.9% in eradication rate. no follow-up examinations in post-treatment were performed in two cases. 3. no adverse reaction was reported, while one case of eosinophilia was noted as an abnormal laboratory test value. 4. as far as compliance is concerned, patients claimed that the formulation of the drug is "easy to take" or "ordinary". with the results presented as above, we have concluded that azm is a useful antibiotic in pediatric patients with bacterial infections.

TI  == a multinational european survey on the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin and other  comparative antibiotics on respiratory and urinary bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of rufloxacin was confirmed against a large number of  respiratory and urinary tract pathogens collected in five european countries. in  terms of both mic90 values and percentages of susceptible isolates found, this new quinolone showed useful in-vitro activity against mycoplasma catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, with a large proportion of staphylococcus aureus also covered, while, as expected streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were not included in its antibacterial spectrum. rufloxacin was comparable with the other antibiotics against these pathogens with the exception of streptococci. against these microorganisms, beta-lactams were the most active agents. against the urinary pathogens the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin is similar to that of norfloxacin although this latter drug is more active in terms of mic90 values and in percentages of strains inhibited. in many  cases more isolates were susceptible to the remaining comparator agents than to rufloxacin. however, there were no significant differences between the numbers of microorganisms inhibited by the various drugs and rufloxacin. the findings of this survey do not seem to modify the general picture which emerged in previous studies and further confirms its useful spectrum in different geographic settings.

AB  == bacterial complications of varicella in 84 patients younger than 16 years of age  (48 females; median age, 2.9 years) who required hospitalization between 1985 and 1995 were retrospectively analyzed. the purpose of the study was to describe demographics, clinical manifestations, bacteriology, and factors affecting outcome. seventy-six percent of patients were younger than 5 years of age. the eldest children in households were significantly underrepresented (p = .00025). skin infections occurred in 61 patients (73%), and deep-seated infections and/or  shock occurred in 23 (27%). the latter complications were significantly associated with thrombocytopenia (p = .011) and bacteremia (p = .014) at the time of admission, prolonged fever (p = .001), prolonged hospitalization (p < .0001),  intensive care management (p < .0001), and fatal outcome (p = .019). group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (59% of isolates) and staphylococcus aureus (28%) were the predominant isolates. before and after 1990, five (31%) of 16 and 13 (62%) of 21 streptococcal complications, respectively, were invasive infections (p = .09). these data underscore the need for universal immunization against chickenpox.

TI  == a multicenter, open label trial of azithromycin vs. amoxicillin/ clavulanate for  the management of acute otitis media in children.
AB  == objective: this randomized, open label study compared the efficacy and safety of  a 5-day course of once daily azithromycin to those of a 10-day course of three times daily amoxicillin/ clavulanate. methods: one hundred sixty-nine children with confirmed acute bacterial otitis media were randomized to treatment with 10  mg/kg of azithromycin oral suspension on day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg once daily for the next 4 days or 40 mg/kg/ day of amoxicillin/clavulanate suspension in three divided doses for 10 days. clinical efficacy and safety were evaluated on days 11 and 30. results: analysis of evaluable patients 11 days after the start of treatment demonstrated that 87.8% of patients treated with azithromycin and 100.0% of the patients treated with amoxicillin/ clavulanate were cured or improved. presumed bacteriologic eradication of the baseline pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes was comparable in the two groups: 87.8% in patients treated with azithromycin; and 100.0% in patients receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate. at day 30, 82.2% of patients treated with azithromycin and 80.0% of patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate were cured or improved. presumed bacteriologic eradication of the base-line pathogens was similar in the two groups: 82.2% in patients treated with azithromycin; and 81.1% in patients receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate. relapses occurred in 5.1% of patients receiving azithromycin and 21.1% of patients taking amoxicillin/clavulanate (p = 0.047). treatment-related side effects occurred in 3.5% of the azithromycin patients compared with 31.0% of amoxicillin/clavulanate  patients (p < 0.001). conclusions: azithromycin was comparable to amoxicillin/clavulanate in achieving clinical cure or improvement and presumed eradication of baseline pathogens in pediatric patients with acute otitis media.  azithromycin was significantly better tolerated and was associated with fewer relapses than seen after amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity and post-antibiotic effect of azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin against some respiratory pathogens.
AB  == recent macrolide derivatives, roxithromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin show more favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison to old ones and some differences in antibacterial activity. with the aim of improving our understanding of some aspects of their action against respiratory pathogens, we determined the mics and mbcs of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. azithromycin was the most active agent against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, while clarithromycin was more active against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus with mics similar to those of erythromycin. the bactericidal activity of all tested derivatives was weak against staphylococcus aureus (mbc/mic ratio approximately 16) and against moraxella catarrhalis (mbc/mic ratio, 8-16), but good against staphylococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mbc/mic ratio, 2-4). the determination of killing curves in the presence of 2 mic and 10 mic of  azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin confirmed their weak bactericidal  activity against staphylococcus aureus and moraxella catarrhalis as well as their effective activity against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. azithromycin showed the highest bactericidal activity against haemophilus influenzae. as expected, the three derivatives produced a quite prolonged pae when exposed to 5 mic for 1 h, ranging between 2-4 h. the bactericidal activity and the prolonged pae of new macrolides for the most common respiratory pathogens should assure a good clinical activity in respiratory infections including those  sustained by haemophilus influenzae, which is less susceptible to erythromycin and other old macrolides.

TI  == correlation of increased azithromycin concentrations with phagocyte infiltration  into sites of localized infection.
AB  == azithromycin reaches high concentrations in phagocytic and other host cells, suggesting that they may transport this agent to specific sites of infection. models of localized infection (haemophilus influenzae middle ear infection in gerbils, streptococcus pyogenes implanted contaminated paper disc and streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia in mice) that induced severe inflammatory response after challenge were used to explore this hypothesis. animals were given a single 100 or 50 mg/kg po dose of azithromycin at various times from 2 to 120 h following introduction of a pathogen or sterile medium. when azithromycin was given during a period of little or no inflammation, there was marginal difference between concentrations found in infected or non-infected sites (bulla, disc, lung). however, when the compound was given during a period of inflammation, considerably higher drug concentrations were found in infected sites than in non-infected sites at 5-24 h after dosing (0.38-0.44 mg/c compared with 0.07-0.14 mg/l of bulla wash; 1.01-1.75 micrograms compared with < or = 0.01-0.03 microgram at the disc site; 1.72-5.28 mg/kg compared with 0.7-1.53 mg/kg of lung). when the observation periods were extended to include 48, 56 or 96 h after dosing, the ratio of azithromycin infection site concentration: serum concentration steadily  increased with time in all model systems (middle ear, implanted disc and pneumonia), reflecting the maintenance of concentrations at the sites of infection, while serum concentrations declined. bioassay of cell pellets and supernatants, obtained from pooled bulla washes of gerbils treated with azithromycin during a period of inflammation, revealed that cellular components accounted for about 75% of the azithromycin detected. these data show that increased azithromycin concentrations occur at sites of localized infection. this correlates with the presence of inflammation and is associated with the cellular  components of the inflammatory response. therefore, phagocytes may be important vehicles for delivering azithromycin to and sustaining azithromycin concentrations at sites of infection.

TI  == brodimoprim: effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations on virulence traits  of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens, and on plasmid transfer and stability.
AB  == the effects of brodimoprim, a new trimethoprim analogue, on several virulence traits of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens exposed to sub-lethal levels of the drug was studied. adherence to tracheal epithelial cells was inhibited by brodimoprim in klebsiella pneumoniae (41-67% reduction), moraxella catarrhalis (87-90%) and haemophilus influenzae (0-53%), while in streptococcus pneumoniae binding was unaffected. with buccal epithelial cells the comparison between treated and control bacteria indicated statistically significant reduction in adherence with both s.pneumoniae and h.influenzae, (p < 0.015). with m.catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes only marginal changes were detected (p > 0.05). exoenzyme and capsule production were assessed in at least three isolates  of diverse respiratory pathogens grown in the presence of sub-lethal levels of the new agent. the drug affected protease and beta-hemolysin (alpha-toxin) production in both oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant s.aureus. on the contrary, synthesis of lipase, dnase, coagulase, and beta-lactamase (s.aureus), pneumolysin (s.pneumoniae), streptolysin s, dnase, and protease (s.pyogenes), capsule (k.pneumoniae, h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae), and beta-lactamase (k.pneumoniae, h.influenzae and m.catarrhalis) were not inhibited by subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-mics) of the drug. finally, motility was blocked in urinary pathogens e.coli, p.mirabilis and p.aeruginosa, while in this latter microorganism pigment production was also affected. high molecular weight low-copy f'lac, and low molecular weight high-copy phsg298 plasmids were eliminated from e.coli treated with sub-mic concentrations of brodimoprim. the incidence and cured cells ranged from 9% for f'lac to 23% for phsg298. f'lac transfer was also inhibited by the drug. when conjugation was carried out with bacteria exposed to brodimoprim (5xmic), a reduction (50%) in the number of recombinants was noted in comparison to the control. the fact that brodimoprim interferes with the expression of some virulence traits, in particular with adherence, at sub-mic levels may assist the drug in eradicating respiratory pathogens from the epithelial lining, thus diminishing the probability of reinfection.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiology of chronic sinusitis.
AB  == chronic sinusitis is one of the most common diseases treated in outpatient centres. in this prospective study, 49 patients with the diagnosis of chronic maxillary sinusitis were evaluated microbiologically by using sinus swab, irrigation fluid and sinus mucosal tissue specimens obtained during endoscopic sinus surgery. there was no bacterial growth in seven cases. in the remaining 42  cases a total of 89 bacteria were isolated, 28 of them being classical pathogens  and 61 being non-classical pathogens. among the classical pathogens staphylococcus aureus was the most common one. the correlation between the isolates obtained from maxillary sinus and isolates obtained from throat, nose and nasopharynx did not have a predictive value. since the overall rate of classical pathogen isolation from patients with chronic sinusitis was not significantly high, the possible role of factors other than bacterial growth should be identified in the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis.

AB  == a multicentre open-label, randomised trial was performed to compare the efficacy  and safety of cefpodoxime proxetil bd and cefaclor tds in the treatment of acute  otitis media in children. a total of 167 children aged from 1 month to 11 years were enrolled in five centres: 78 treated with cefpodoxime and 83 treated with cefaclor, were evaluated in the itt analysis. after tympanocentesis and culture of middle ear fluid, a pathogen was isolated from 85 (53%) of the 161 evaluable patients for the itt analysis. the organisms isolated were as follows: streptococcus pneumoniae: (n = 33, 37.5%); haemophilus influenzae: (n = 22, 25%); staphylococcus aureus: (n = 15, 17.1%); streptococcus pyogenes: (n = 8, 9.1%); moraxella catarrhalis: (n = 2, 2.3%); others (n = 6, 6.8%). success (defined as a satisfactory clinical outcome, either cure or improvement) was achieved at the end of treatment, in 93.6% of ther patients in the cefpodoxime group and 91.6% of the patients in the cefaclor group (p> 0.05). clinical recurrence was identified  at the follow-up visit (30 days after inclusion), in 6.4% of the cefpodoxime-treated patients and 7.2% of the cefaclor-treated patients (p> 0.05). the drugs were well tolerated by 78/79 (99%) of patients in the cefpodoxime-treated group and 80/85 (94%) in the cefaclor-treated group. the incidence of adverse effects was higher in the cefaclor group than in the cefpodoxime group, but this was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). in conclusion, cefpodaxime proxetil administered bd is as effective as cefaclor administered tds in the treatment of acute otitis media in children. the less frequent dosing schedule of cefpodoxime (bd) compared with cefaclor (tds) appears to be more convenient for the treatment of the infections in children.

TI  == two-dimensional electrophoretic patterns of acute-phase human serum proteins in the course of bacterial and viral diseases.
AB  == acute-phase serum proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis with  isoelectric focusing in 3-10 immobilized ph gradients. most spots were identified by reference to the plasma map in the swiss-2dpage database. serum amyloid a protein spots were identified by immunoblotting with specific antiserum and by matching determined with predicted values of electrophoretic parameters. changes  in the concentrations of alpha 1-antitrypsin, leucine-rich glycoprotein, haptoglobin, serum retinol-binding protein and transthyretin were quantitated by  densitometry of silver-stained gels. electrophoretic patterns from 18 patients with bacterial diseases and 16 patients with viral diseases were compared. the incidence of serum amyloid a protein spots was 18/18 in bacterial diseases and 6/16 in viral diseases. as the the other reactants studied, variations were simultaneous in bacterial disease and tended to be staggered in viral diseases.

AB  == the in vitro activity of rufloxacin, alone and in combination with its metabolite (mf 922) against common respiratory and urinary tract pathogens and anaerobes was assessed. no synergistic interaction between rufloxacin and mf 922 was observed by the checkerboard technique against aerobic bacteria. when the time-kill system was employed, 24 synergistic interactions were noted out of 30 tests performed (80%), of which 14 (100%) were with enterobacteriaceae isolates, 2 with moraxella catarrhalis (50%), 4 with haemophilus influenzae (100%), 2 with staphylococcus aureus (50%) and 2 with streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes (50%). synergism was found with all bacteroides fragilis irrespectively of the method used. rufloxacin alone or in combination with mf 922, at concentrations achieved in vivo, induced morphological alterations in all the pathogens analyzed with the exception of m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. towards s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae, the same levels of rufloxacin and mf 922 were capable of inducing  only bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal effect, followed by reversible morphological modifications. the presence of 50% human serum in the test media did not affect the results.

TI  == the role of tissue colonization and bacterial resistance in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == unsuccessful medical therapy for treatment of acute tonsillitis frequently results in onset of recurrent or chronic forms rendering surgical treatment necessary. we have studied some of the factors involved in the evolution of these chronic or recurrent forms and, in particular, the distribution of different bacterial strains in tonsillar tissue, their response to treatment with antibiotics and mechanisms of bacterial resistance. the distribution of bacterial flora (saprophytic and pathogenic) present on the surface of the tonsils, in the  crypts and in the tonsillar tissue was studied in a control population of 30 children (20 boys and 10 girls) aged between 2-13 years, all affected with chronic tonsillitis and submitted to tonsillectomy. the same study was performed  in a group of 80 sex and aged matched children, also presenting with chronic or recurrent tonsillitis and treated with amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or cefaclor or clarithromycin 72 h before surgery. the 80 subjects were randomly  divided into four groups so that each antibiotic was tested on 20 subjects. the distribution of the bacterial population on the surface of tonsillar tissue, in the crypts and in the deeper tonsillar tissue is of particular interest concerning the affinity of bacteria to the different tissue areas. in particular  the interaction between crypt and tonsillar core, which could be a factor involved in the process of worsening of bacterial infection in the tonsils, is evidenced. the four antibodies tested showed different abilities to eradicate infection: haemophilus influenzae was found to be the most resistant germ to antibiotic therapy and was thus the most frequent cause of recurrent infections.  the characteristics and the mechanisms of adherence and resistance to beta lactam antibiotics were also analysed.

TI  == molecular population genetic analysis of emerged bacterial pathogens: selected insights.
AB  == research in bacterial population genetics has increased in the last 10 years. population genetic theory and tools and related strategies have been used to investigate bacterial pathogens that have contributed to recent episodes of temporal variation in disease frequency and severity. a common theme demonstrated by these analyses is that distinct bacterial clones are responsible for disease outbreaks and increases in infection frequency. many of these clones are characterized by unique combinations of virulence genes or alleles of virulence genes. because substantial interclonal variance exists in relative virulence, molecular population genetic studies have led to the concept that the unit of bacterial pathogenicity is the clone or cell line. continued new insights into host parasite interactions at the molecular level will be achieved by combining clonal analysis of bacterial pathogens with large-scale comparative sequencing of virulence genes.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight european countries.
AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. the in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. cefetamet killed 100% haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing  strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae at < or =  0.5 mg/l, s. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l.  moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective  against escherichia coli (94%), klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), k. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x mic demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing h.  influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and k. pneumoniae within 6 h and s. pneumoniae within 4 h. hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to tem1 and shv1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.

TI  == the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in children with otitis media with effusion.
AB  == a study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of nasopharyngeal alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against pathogens, as a defense mechanism of the normal bacterial flora against infection. cultures were taken from the nasopharynges of 43 children with otitis media with effusion (ome). the  detection rates of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococus aureus and group  a streptococci were significantly lower in the nasopharynx than those isolated from the tonsils of the same patients. moreover, the detection rates of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against all of these pathogens derived from the nasopharynx were lower than those in healthy children, streptococcal strains with activity against h. influenzae and strep, pneumoniae were also lower than that in patients with tonsillitis. these findings suggest that low nasopharyngeal levels of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against respiratory pathogens may render children susceptible to ome. further studies are needed to investigate the relationships between the prevalence of pathogens in the nasopharynx and the inhibitory activities of alpha-streptococci  against them in order to devise and select optimal treatment for patients with ome.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == etiology of acute otitis media in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children.
AB  == background: acute otitis media (aom) is one of the most common infections that are implicated as significant contributors to morbidity in hiv-infected children. to establish the optimal antibiotic therapy tympanocentesis is indicated as the first line diagnostic procedure, because unusual pathogens may play a role in advanced stages of deficient humoral or cellular immunity. methods: the microbiology of 60 episodes of aom diagnosed in 21 symptomatic hiv-infected children (ages 9 months to 12 years) was compared with that of 121 episodes of aom occurring in 113 immunocompetent hiv-negative children (ages 6 months to 12 years) in the last 5 years. results: the prevalence of the three most common pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus) was similar in hiv-infected and in normal children  (56.5% vs. 54.9% of the ears). staphylococcus aureus was significantly more frequent in aom diagnosed in severely immunosuppressed stages. a significantly lower proportion of middle ear effusions obtained in hiv-infected children yielded no bacteria compared with normal children. beta-lactamase production among isolates of h. influenzae was a rare phenomenon, both in hiv-infected and in normal children. no penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae was found. conclusions: in hiv-infected children with absent or moderate immunosuppression empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the recommendations given for immunocompetent children of the same geographic area. in severe immunosuppressed  stages, given the possible role of staph. aureus, extended spectrum antibiotics should be considered.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy issues facing pediatricians.
AB  == in the field of infectious diseases, the emergence of new pathogens or old diseases in newly recognized forms; changing virulence of pathogens; changing patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility; new diagnostic techniques, drugs or vaccines; changing concepts of chemoprophylaxis; controversies about medical vs.  surgical techniques; and the challenge of care of children with infectious diseases within new guidelines of managed care are recently identified areas of change. the increased resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae to many commonly used antimicrobials and the increased proportion of beta-lactamase-producing nontypable haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis concern many practitioners. the decreased antibiotic susceptibility of s. pneumoniae is a relatively new phenomenon in the united states. optimal therapy for mild, moderate or severe pneumococcal disease is dependent on current local susceptibility patterns. group a streptococci are uniformly susceptible to readily achieved concentrations of all penicillins and cephalosporins. however, recent clusters of cases of rheumatic fever, increased recognition of toxic shock syndrome and bacteremic and localized severe pneumococcal disease have increased  concern about the changing ecology of the streptococcus and the implications for  therapy. finally recognition that many children with acute bacterial otitis media have resolution of disease without use of antimicrobial agents has led to more rigorous study designs for evaluating new drugs.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == toc-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == toc-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. toc-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. toc-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin,  and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and  had an mic comparable to that of vancomycin (the mics of toc-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). against enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, toc-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, toc-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. against streptococcus pyogenes, toc-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. in addition, the activity of toc-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii. in terms of bactericidal effect against mrsa, toc-39 was superior to vancomycin. no mutant resistant to toc-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible mrsa strains. in  murine systemic infection models, toc-39 showed potent activity against s. aureus and e. coli. against highly mrsa, the activity of toc-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and mics of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (dmppc)-susceptible staphylococcus aureus subsp.  aureus (mssa), about 80% of dmppc-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 100% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, 95% of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of haemophilus influenzae.  several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc against beta-lactamase producing strains of mssa, m. (b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == [the effect of cefaclor and cefixime on nasopharyngeal pathogens in children].
AB  == changes in nasopharyngeal flora were investigated in children with acute otitis media and with acute exacerbations of chronic sinusitis in whom antibiotic therapy of relatively long duration was required until substantial improvement in clinical findings was achieved. 1. the antibiotics used were two cephalosporins,  i.e., cefaclor (ccl) and cefixime (cfix), administered to 18 patients each for 1  week and to 26 and 20 patients, respectively, for 2 weeks. bacteriologic examination of the nasopharyngeal mucosa was performed at the first visit and at  1 week in those who underwent antibiotic therapy for 1 week, and at the first visit and at 1 and 2 weeks in those treated with antibiotics for 2 weeks. 2. the  elimination rates for the infecting microorganisms in the patients in the ccl-treated group were 30% for haemophilus influenzae, 83% for staphylococcus aureus, 100% for streptococcus pyogenes and 100% for streptococcus pneumoniae at  1 week, and 18% for h. influenzae, 100% for s. aureus and 100% for s. pyogenes at 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy. replacement of s. aureus and s. pyogenes by h. influenzae was observed. 3. the elimination rates for infecting bacteria in the patients in the cfix-treated groups were 61% for h. influenzae, 50% for s. aureus, 75% for s. pyogenes, 80% for s. pneumoniae and 100% for moraxella catarrhalis at 1 week, and 72% for h. influenzae, 0% for s. aureus, 100% for s. pyogenes, and 0% for s. pneumoniae at 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy. the elimination rate for h. influenzae at 2 weeks was significantly higher than the corresponding value for the ccl-treated group. replacement of h. influenzae by s. aureus and s. pneumoniae and of s. pyogenes by s. aureus was detected. 4. there was one patient with acute otitis media in the cfix-treated group in whom a clinical relapse occurred due to h. influenzae persisters in the nasopharynx. thus the diagnosis in this patient was so-called "recurrent otitis media". 5. h.  influenzae tended to persist after exposure to therapeutically adequate concentrations of ccl, as did s. aureus and s. pneumoniae following treatment with cfix. thus, it would seem that ample heed must be given to persistence, particularly of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae, the most common causative agents of acute otitis media in childhood. 6. a significant rise in the mics of the cephalosporins was observed in 4 of 43 patients in whom the same type of organism was isolated from the nasopharynx at weekly intervals during antibiotic therapy.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of the sputum pathogens and throat swab pathogens isolated from the patients undergoing treatment in twenty-one private clinics in  japan.
AB  == bacteriology of the respiratory isolates from 2,539 patients with respiratory infections in 21 primary care clinics was documented. of a total of 1,887 strains of potential pathogens recovered from 1,507 patients, 996 were gram-positive and  891 were gram-negative. major pathogens were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. the mic's against microbial isolates of six antimicrobial agents were determined. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against s. aureus, moraxella catarrhalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin and cefteram were more active against s. pnuemoniae and s. pyogenes than four other antimicrobials tested, respectively, in this experiment. new quinolones and new generation cephems were active against h. influenzae and enterobacteriaceae. only one strain of s. aureus was methicillin-resistant. as regards other pathogens, 6.5% of s. pneumoniae and 14.9% of h. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin, and 26.7% of  h. influenzae were beta-lactamase-positive. mrsa was found infrequently. but ampicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae were found in primary care clinics almost as frequently as in intensive-medication-oriented clinics.

TI  == group a streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis: cost-effective diagnosis and treatment.
AB  == most patients who seek medical attention for sore throat are concerned about streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, but fewer than 10% of adults and 30% of children actually have a streptococcal infection. group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gas) are most often responsible for bacterial tonsillopharyngitis,  although neisseria gonorrhea, arcanobacterium haemolyticum (formerly corynebacterium haemolyticum), chlamydia pneumoniae (twar agent), and mycoplasma  pneumoniae have also been suggested as possible, infrequent, sporadic pathogens.  viruses or idiopathic causes account for the remainder of sore throat complaints. reliance on clinical impression to diagnose gas tonsillopharyngitis is problematic; an overestimation of 80% to 95% by experienced clinicians typically  occurs for adult patients. overtreatment promotes bacterial resistance, disturbs  natural microbial ecology, and may produce unnecessary side effects. existing data suggest that rapid gas antigen testing as an aid to clinical diagnosis can be very useful. when used appropriately, it is sensitive (79% to 88%) in detecting gas-infected patients and is specific (90% to 96%) and cost-effective.  penicillin has been the treatment of choice for gas tonsillopharyngitis since the 1950s; 10 days of treatment are necessary for bacterial eradication. a single im  injection of benzathine penicillin is effective and obviates compliance issues. until the early 1970s, the bacteriologic failure rate for the treatment of gas tonsillopharyngitis ranged from 2% to 10% and was attributed to chronic gas carriers. since the late 1970s, the penicillin failure rate has frequently exceeded 20% in published reports. explanations for recurrent gas tonsillopharyngitis include poor patient compliance; reacquisition from a family  member or peer, copathogenic colonization by staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, anaerobes that inactivate penicillin with beta-lactamase, or all these organisms; suppression of natural immune response by too-early administration of antibiotics; gas tolerance to penicillin; antibiotic  eradication of normal pharyngeal flora that normally act as natural host defenses; and establishment of a true carrier state. when therapy fails, milder symptoms may occur during the relapse. several antimicrobials have demonstrated superior efficacy compared with penicillin in eradicating gas and are administered less frequently to enhance patient compliance. in previously untreated gas throat infections, cephalosporins produce a 5% to 22% higher bacteriologic cure rate; after a penicillin treatment failure, these differences  are greater. amoxicillin/clavulanate and the extended-spectrum macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin may also produce enhanced bacteriologic eradication in comparison to penicillin.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == persistent acute otitis media: ii. antimicrobial treatment.
AB  == in this three-year prospective study, 137 children with acute otitis media (aom)  that had not responded after one or two empiric antimicrobial treatment courses (termed persistent aom) underwent tympanocentesis to determine additional antimicrobial therapy based on in vitro susceptibility testing of the bacterial isolate(s). one hundred eleven children with aom not previously treated are described for comparison. in the persistent aom group middle ear aspirates grew streptococcus pneumoniae (24%), haemophilus influenzae (7%), brahamella catarrhalis (7%), streptococcus pyogenes (6%), staphylococcus aureus (5%), two pathogens (3%) or no bacterial growth (49%); pathogens in previously untreated aom were similar but fewer patients (30%) had no bacterial growth. after tympanocentesis additional antimicrobial therapy for persistent aom patients utilizing drugs shown to be effective in vitro against the isolated pathogen failed to produce clinical resolution of infection in 27 (28%) of ears. differing clinical efficacy was observed with various antimicrobials: amoxicillin (57% failure); trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (75% failure); cefaclor (37% failure); cefixime (23% failure); amoxicillin/clavulanate (12% failure); and cefuroxime axetil (13% failure). presumptive clinical cure for previously untreated aom patients was similar to that for untreated aom except for fewer amoxicillin failures (30%). we conclude that clinical failure in persistent aom occurs (1) even when no pathogen is isolated from tympanocentesis (50% of patients) and (2)  despite demonstrated in vitro activity against culture-proved pathogens.

TI  == persistent acute otitis media: i. causative pathogens.
AB  == in this prospective study tympanocentesis was performed to determine the pathogens isolated from middle ear fluid of 200 ears in 137 children with acute otitis media (aom) which had not responded after one or two empiric antimicrobial treatment courses (termed persistent aom). for comparison tympanocentesis from 154 ears in 111 children with aom not previously treated are described. patients  were enrolled from october, 1989, until september, 1992. in the persistent aom group amoxicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were the most frequently used antimicrobials before tympanocentesis. middle ear aspirates produced no pathogenic bacterial growth in 49% of persistent aom patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 24%, haemophilus influenzae in 7%, branhamella catarrhalis in 7%, streptococcus pyogenes in 6%, staphylococcus aureus in 5% and two pathogens in 3%. two (18%) of 11 s. pneumoniae isolates tested were penicillin-resistant; 1 was intermediate and 1 was highly resistant. ten (83%) of 12 h. influenzae and all of 11 b. catarrhalis aom isolates produced beta-lactamase. in comparison previously untreated aom patients produced no bacterial growth from tympanocentesis in 30%, s. pneumoniae in 36% (8% penicillin-resistant), h. influenaze in 13% (44% beta-lactamase-producing) and b. catarrhalis in 11% (85% beta-lactamase producing). aom which is persistent after initial empiric antimicrobial therapy may be caused by middle ear inflammation after bacteria are killed or involve penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae or b. catarrhalis more commonly than occurs in aom which has not been  recently treated.

AB  == tonsillar tissue lymphocyte (ttl) function as measured by immunoglobulin production was assessed in vitro in 60 tonsils, 51 diseased and 9 normal controls. the diseased specimens were from children (aged 3 to 10 years) clinically classified as having recurrent tonsillitis (rt), idiopathic tonsillar  hyperplasia (ith), or recurrent tonsillitis with hyperplasia (rt/h). ttls were challenged with intact, heat-inactivated bacteria found in the core of diseased tonsils--streptococcus pyogenes (sp) and haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) as well as the dominant bacterium (db) grown from that particular tonsillar core. the phytomitogen, leukoagglutinin (la), was used as a nonspecific activator. qualitative immunoglobulin production was assessed for the immunoglobulin g (igg), immunoglobulin m (igm), and immunoglobulin a (iga) classes. immunoglobulin-specific production was quantified at the basal level, and at 2, 4, and 6 days following stimulation. stimulation with hib produced the greatest amount of igg and igm in ttls from control tonsils. the db was a relatively weak  stimulator of normal (control) ttls, yet produced relatively brisk igg responses  in the rt and ith categories. it did, however, yield only marginal igm secretion  in these groups. iga was consistently produced after stimulation in diseased ttls, yet was not elicited from normal ttls. the aforementioned findings suggest  a differential qualitative and quantitative immunoglobulin response for healthy,  recurrently infected, and hyperplastic tonsils. lymphocyte hypofunction along with structural changes associated with hyperplasia may be central to the etiology of chronic tonsillar disease. the tonsillar immunologic response in disease and health is discussed.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of sy5555 in pediatrics].
AB  == we assessed the in vitro antimicrobial activity and the clinical efficacy and safety of sy5555 in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized  below. 1. in vitro antibacterial activities of sy5555 against 52 clinical isolates were compared with those of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (cva/ampc), cefotiam (ctm), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefaclor (ccl) and cefdinir (cfdn). against gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, sy5555 displayed antimicrobial activities superior or nearly equivalent to those of the reference agents used in the study. in cases of gram-negative bacteria, the antimicrobial activity of sy5555 against haemophilus  influenzae was inferior to those of cpdx and cfdn. against klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of sy5555 was less potent than that of cpdx. 2. forty-seven children with infectious diseases were treated with sy5555 dry syrup  (powder dissolved just before use). the clinical results were excellent in 24 and good in 16, with an efficacy rate of 85.1%. 3. bacteriological screening identified 30 pathogenic organisms, and the eradication rate was 76.7%. 4. side effects consisted of diarrhea in 12.5% (6 cases), loose stools in 4.2% (2 cases)  and urticaria in 2.1% (1 case) of the patients. the only abnormal laboratory test value observed was an increase in eosinophil count in one child. 5. the palatability of sy5555 dry syrup was very good; it was very easily ingestable or  easily ingestable by 32 of the 48 children. from the above results, sy5555 dry syrup appears to be a useful drug with a preferable safety profile in the treatment of pediatric patients with infectious diseases.

TI  == in vitro activities of a streptogramin (rp59500), three macrolides, and an azalide against four respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == broth microdilution tests were carried out with 2,671 respiratory tract isolates  from 19 medical centers throughout the continental united states. the tests compared a streptogramin (rp59500) to erythromycin, dirithromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin against streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. against macrolide-susceptible  strains, the potency of rp59500 was similar to that of the macrolides: the azalide, azithromycin, was two to four times more potent against h. influenzae. the azalide and three macrolides showed nearly complete cross-resistance. at 2.0  micrograms/ml or less, the streptogramin, rp59500, was active against both macrolide-resistant and -susceptible strains of s. pneumoniae (mic for 50% of the strains tested, 0.25 microgram/ml; mic for 90% of the strains tested, 0.5 microgram/ml).

TI  == postantibiotic effects and postantibiotic sub-mic effects of roxithromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin on respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == pharmacodynamic parameters have become increasingly important for the determination of the optimal dosing schedules of antibiotics. in this study, the  postantibiotic effects (paes), the postantibiotic sub-mic effects (pa smes), and  the sub-mic effects (smes) of roxithromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin on  reference strains of streptococcus pyogenes group a, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae were investigated. the pae was induced by 2x mics (s.  pneumoniae) or 10x mics of the different drugs for 2 h, and the antibiotics were  eliminated by washing and dilution. the pa smes were studied by addition of 0.1,  0.2, and 0.3x mics during the postantibiotic phase of the bacteria, and the smes  were studied by exposition of the bacteria to the drugs at the sub-mics only. growth curves were followed by viable counts for 24 h. the smes were generally very short. a pae of 2.9 to 8 h was noted for all antibiotics against all strains. clarithromycin induced a statistically significantly shorter pae on s. pneumoniae than did roxithromycin and azithromycin and did so also against h. influenzae in comparison with azithromycin. the pa smes were long and varied at 0.3x mic between 6.4 19.6 h. this pronounced suppression of regrowth of bacteria  which are first treated with a suprainhibitory concentration of antibiotics and then reexposed to sub-mic levels indicates that long dosing intervals for macrolides and azalides can be allowed.

TI  == development of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae dna.
AB  == in this study, we have developed a chemically sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to detect the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae genomic dna. the target dna sequence was a 322-base pair segment of the s. pneumoniae dna polymerase i gene (pol i). pcr products of pure cultures of a set  of pneumococcal serotypes commonly associated with human infection could be amplified in water and in blood cultures of clinical isolates containing s. pneumoniae. we were able to detect 2 fg of purified s. pneumoniae dna. there were no false-positive reactions when the assay was performed on samples containing the following clinically encountered bacteria: haemophilus influenzae type b, neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas spp. nontypeable h. influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and streptococcus pyogenes. the addition of edta and citrate-anticoagulated whole blood to the pcr reaction mixture inhibited the pcr  assay, whereas the addition of lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and sodium polyanetholesulfonate-anticoagulated whole blood to pcr reaction mixture did not  interfere with the ability to detect the presence of s. pneumoniae dna.

TI  == [respiratory tract infections: how frequent is antibiotic resistance? in vitro activity of older and recent antibiotics against the significant pathogens].
AB  == presumably influenced by the new cost-saving health care regulations, more of the long-established antibiotics are now being prescribed. this fact prompted the present study on the current resistance profiles of such antibiotics used to treat major pathogens responsible for airway infections. a total of 202 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were investigated. sensitivity was determined using the agar dilution test for doxycycline, erythromycin, penicillin g, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefpodoxime. in the case of such older antibiotics as doxycycline, erythromycin and amoxicillin, certain shortcomings in their efficacy against these common pathogens were found, while the bacteria were all sensitive to a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and to the oral cephalosporin, cefodoxime. in order to avoid the risk of ineffectivity in the treatment of infection of the airways, it is recommended that in germany a new oral cephalosporin or a combination of an aminopenicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor be used.

TI  == acute otorrhea: bacteriology of a common complication of tympanostomy tubes.
AB  == we prospectively followed 246 children with tympanostomy tubes and observed acute otorrhea through a functioning tube at least once in 50% of subjects. pathogens typical of acute otitis media (streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes) were found in 42% of all episodes; pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus was found in 44% of all episodes. pathogens of acute otitis media were found in 50.0% of subjects under 6 years old versus 4.4% of subjects 6 years or over at the first episode (p < .001). pseudomonas aeruginosa was found more often in children 6 years or older (43.5% versus 20.5% at the first episode, p = .052). pathogens typical of acute otitis media were less prevalent in the summer months (14.7% versus 52.2% for the first episode, p = .001), while p aeruginosa was more prevalent in summer (44.1%  versus 16.4% for the first episode, p = .006). this suggests that while many younger children with acute otorrhea may respond to treatment with oral antimicrobials alone, outpatient therapy of older children may involve use of topical antipseudomonal agents that may be complicated by the question of the safety of such medications.

TI  == compartmentalization of specific b-cells in sheep mucosae associated lymphoid organs.
AB  == numerous studies have shown that peyer's patches (pp) contribute to the seeding of other lymphoid organs in sheep. this was demonstrated by perfusing labeled lymphocytes in pp, and later investigating their presence in drainage lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral blood or bone marrow. these data showed that pp export  considerable numbers of cells every day, but provided no information as to their  specificity. in this work, we used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)  spot method to investigate, in the peripheral blood, mesenteric and cervical lymph nodes and tonsils from ten sheep, the numbers of specific b-cells, directed to four common bacteria of the oro-pharyngeal area of mammals: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae or klebsiella pneumoniae. the data were obtained from five sets of monozygous sheep, one animal of each pair being previously fed ribosomal preparations of these bacteria. both  prior to and after oral challenge, specific b-cells could be found in all the tissues tested. they were mostly igg-producing cells and preferentially located in oro-pharyngeal drainage lymph nodes and tonsils. their numbers increased in these lymph nodes after stimulation, while they decreased in mesenteric lymph nodes. these observations are consistent with the current hypothesis suggesting intestinal sensitization, proliferation and fast emigration of specific b-cells after oral challenge.

TI  == otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  == otitis media (om) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. a knowledge of the pathogens responsible for om can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. the microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic om is reviewed. the major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute om and half of serous om cultures are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute om. the predominant organisms isolated from chronic om are staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp. many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing om can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. the appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.

AB  == forty-nine bacterial strains representing five species known to interact with human plasminogen were tested for the ability to bind the two major human plasminogen activators, t-pa and urokinase. the bacterial species tested included haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus equisimilis and human group g streptococci. all n. meningitidis and 11 of 14 h. influenzae strains displayed substantial binding of t-pa with values  in the range of 20-46%. on the contrary, none of the streptococcal strains bound  significant amounts of tpa. with urokinase no binding could be found for any of the bacterial species tested. scatchard analysis with a selected h. influenzae strain (hi23354) demonstrated 10,000 receptors per bacterium for t-pa with a kd value of about 20 nmol l-1. the corresponding values with a selected n. meningitidis strain (mo 52) was 8500 receptors per bacterium and 70 nmol l-1. t-pa binding could be reduced about 40% by the addition of 10 mmol l-1 of the lysine analogue epsilon-aminocaproic acd (eaca) whereas no inhibitory effect could be demonstrated with arginine. addition of 2 mumol l-1 of plasminogen which is enough to occupy all bacterial sites for plasminogen did not interfere with the t-pa binding, suggesting that the receptors for t-pa and plasminogen are distinct. using very high plasminogen concentrations however, t-pa binding could  be reduced by about 50% possibly due to an interaction between t-pa and plasminogen in the fluid phase. our results demonstrate the occurrence of a previously unknown type of bacterial receptor that is capable of specifically binding t-pa.

AB  == the efficacy of ribosomal preparations as mucosal immunostimulants was examined in the peripheral blood and tonsils of 14 children, before and after 28 days of oral treatment with d-53, a preparation of ribosomes from klebsiella pneumoniae,  streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pyogenes. tonsils from 10 untreated children were used as controls. immunofluorescence and  elisaspot were performed to analyse variations in the numbers of immunoglobulin-containing and immunoglobulin-secreting b-cells. both isotypic and antigenic specificities of these two types of cells were investigated. significant differences were observed after treatment in the peripheral blood as  well as between tonsils from treated and untreated children. in the peripheral blood a significant increase in immunoglobulin-secreting cells directed against antigenic specificities of d-53 was the major change. in tonsils, higher numbers  of specific immunoglobulin-containing and secreting cells, and higher numbers of  iga-secreting cells were induced in treated children. these data support the efficacy of d-53 as an oral immunostimulant.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == cefuroxime axetil.
AB  == cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from  the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin c. cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. the majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. these include haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and the  other streptococci (excluding group d streptococci), and moraxella catarrhalis. bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella and shigella and straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). the pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. the absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. the protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. an oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available  as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). cefuroxime axetil  is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic  bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). for most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate.  in some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. if pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. adverse reactions to  cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).

TI  == immune response in the lungs following oral immunization with bacterial lysates of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == we have investigated the local immune response of the balb/c mouse respiratory tract after oral immunization with a bacterial lysate of seven common respiratory pathogens. after two immunization on five consecutive days, we examined the immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin g [igg], igm, and iga) secretion rates of cells isolated from the lungs and compared them with those of spleen cells of orally immunized and nonimmunized animals by using a new test system based on time-resolved fluorescence. the procedure followed the principle of the classical elispot test with nitrocellulose-bottomed microtiter plates, but europium (eu3+)-linked streptavidin rather than enzyme-conjugated streptavidin was used, with the advantage of quantifying secreted immunoglobulins instead of detecting single antibody-secreting cells. lymphocytes isolated from the lungs of treated animals revealed significant increases in total and antigen-specific iga synthesis compared with the rates of the controls, whereas igg and igm production rates showed no remarkable differences. in addition, the sera of treated mice revealed higher antigen-specific iga titers but not increased igm and igg levels. we conclude that priming the gut-associated lymphoid tissue with bacterial antigens of pneumotropic microorganisms can elicit an enhanced iga response in a  distant mucosal effector site, such as the respiratory tract, according to the concept of a common mucosa-associated immune system.

TI  == penicillin failure and copathogenicity in streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  == recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gabhs) pharyngotonsillitis related to penicillin failure presents a serious clinical problem. failure to eradicate streptococci from patients can occasionally lead to rheumatic fever and rarely to glomerulonephritis. beta-lactamase-producing strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in inflamed tonsils have been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in the eradication of these infections. these organisms include staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and h parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, fusobacterium sp, and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent  in their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these organisms have demonstrated the ability to protect gabhs in vitro and in vivo from penicillin. numerous reports have described the successful therapy of recurrent gabhs tonsillitis with antimicrobials directed at both gabhs and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

AB  == objective: to examine secular trends in the epidemiology, bacteriology, and clinical presentation of acute epiglottitis in children in the years surrounding  the introduction of vaccine against haemophilus influenzae type b. design: retrospective chart review of patient series. setting: large, urban, tertiary care pediatric hospital. subjects: one hundred forty-two children with epiglottitis admitted during a 14-year period (1979 through 1992). main results:  the average annual incidence of epiglottitis declined from 10.9 per 10,000 admissions before 1990 to 1.8 per 10,000 admissions from 1990 through 1992. the median age increased from 35.5 months in the earlier period to 80.5 months (p = .007). overall, h influenzae type b was identified as the causative organism in 76% of patients, but in only 25% of the cases since 1990 (p = .004). of the eight cases from 1990 through 1992, three had group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus isolated from a surface culture of the epiglottis; three other cases of group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus were identified earlier. these patients were significantly older than those with h influenzae type b disease (117.5 vs 35 months, p = .004). no important differences were found in any of a number of clinical characteristics based on causative organism or year of diagnosis. conclusion: acute epiglottitis has diminished in frequency since 1990. patients whose conditions have been diagnosed since then tend to be older and to have disease caused by organisms other than h influenzae type b (particularly group a  beta-hemolytic streptococcus). however, the clinical presentation appears to be similar to that seen previously.

TI  == bacterial resistance in eastern europe--selected problems.
AB  == the profile of infection and pattern of bacterial resistance in eastern europe is distinct from that observed in other parts of the world. several polish investigations have reported that environmental pollution may increase the risk of respiratory disease. studies from hungary and romania have documented a dramatic increase in the proportion of streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to antibiotics. in comparison, resistance to these agents amongst polish pneumococci isolates is lower, although these pathogens and streptococcus pyogenes have displayed increasing tetracycline resistance. 20% of polish haemophilus influenzae isolates and a high percentage of moraxella catarrhalis strains exhibit ampicillin resistance. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has been found to constitute 22% of polish s. aureus strains. two major clones of mrsa have been identified in poland which differ in their degree  of antimicrobial resistance. the pattern of antimicrobial resistance amongst polish respiratory pathogens is undoubtedly a reflection of management policies and the use of these drugs. it is hoped that the economic and political changes taking place within eastern europe will provide the information and resources to  establish more efficient infection control and antibiotic policy and thus delay and limit the appearance of bacterial resistance.

AB  == cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation  cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the  potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.

TI  == agar disk diffusion (bauer-kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (atcc) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  == several agar media (mueller-hinton agar, mha; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, dsta; schaedler agar, scha; todd-hewitt agar with added yeast extract, thya; wilkins-chalgren agar, wca) were compared using the bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: staphylococcus  aureus atcc 25923 and atcc 29213, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and atcc 35218, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212. mha, dsta, and thya yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. however, wca and  scha antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, scha  antagonized polymyxin b, and both wca and scha antagonized imipenem against the p. aeruginosa strain, but not against the e. coli strains. sheep blood-mha (bl-mha), wca, thya, and dsta were examined with streptococcus pyogenes atcc 19615, streptococcus agalactiae atcc 13813, and streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 6306. in comparison with bl-mha, both wca and thya yielded comparable inhibition  zones against s. pyogenes; dsta afforded suboptimal growth. dsta yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against s. agalactiae,  whereas wca and thya enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin g against  this strain. s. pneumoniae strain atcc 6306 grew well on bl-mha, yielded suboptimal growth on wca and faint growth on thya, and failed to grow on dsta. chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-mha (choc-mha) was compared with haemophilus test medium (htm), wca with added nad, and thya with added hematin and nad against haemophilus influenzae strains atcc 35056 and atcc 49247. the activities  of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by htm, wca+nad, and thya+hematin+nad. only wca+nad antagonized cotrimoxazole against both h. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, htm antagonized cotrimoxazole against s. aureus atcc 25923 and e. coli atcc 25922. it was concluded that bl-mha performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. likewise, choc-mha was optimal for the two h. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.

TI  == stability in the presence of widespread beta-lactamases. a prerequisite for the antibacterial activity of beta-lactam drugs.
AB  == bacterial resistance to the beta-lactam drugs is extremely widespread, as a result of extensive drug use. loss of susceptibility is primarily attributable to hydrolysis by inactivating enzymes, namely the beta-lactamases. while the number  of characterised beta-lactamases may exceed 100, only a few are a problem in the  treatment of community-acquired infections (tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, bro-1). chromosomally mediated and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are usually dominant in nosocomial pathogens where oral antibiotic therapy is seldom used. therefore,  the threat posed by beta-lactamases must be considered in general practice. several effective strategies have been implemented in order to overcome beta-lactamase-mediated resistance, e.g. use of non-beta-lactam drugs or beta-lactamase inhibitors. another option has been the development of new beta-lactam compounds that possess a high intrinsic stability against the hydrolytic action of common beta-lactamases. among these compounds, the oral third generation cephalosporins represent an important breakthrough. cefetamet pivoxil, a new oral third generation cephalosporin, is characterised by excellent antimicrobial potency against enterobacteriaceae, and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of their ability to produce  beta-lactamases. the gram-positive respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes  and penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae, are also satisfactorily covered. the activity of cefetamet has recently been corroborated in a survey conducted in italy involving 4191 isolates. however, cefetamet shows no activity against enterococci, staphylococci, listeria, alpha-streptococci, pseudomonas, acinetobacter and anaerobes. given this antibacterial profile, cefetamet pivoxil  may provide a useful alternative to other oral antibacterial agents in the empirical therapy of acute community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections. from the results of the italian survey, cefetamet emerged as the only agent among those considered (which included cefuroxime, cefaclor, cefalexin, cefadroxil, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, doxycycline, erythromycin and clindamycin) that might be selected as the drug of  choice in the empirical therapy of outpatient infections.

TI  == [basic and clinical studies on s-1108 in pediatric field].
AB  == s-1108 is a new oral esterified cephem antibiotic. its active form, s-1006, has a broad antimicrobial spectrum against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, s-1006 is extremely stable against beta-lactamases with some exceptions. in the present study, we conducted laboratory and clinical evaluations of s-1108 granules in pediatrics. the obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. a drug sensitivity test revealed that mic80 of the drug against 456 clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus that had been kept in our laboratory was 6.25 micrograms/ml, similar to those of cefaclor (ccl) and methicillin (dmppc). the most frequent mic was 1.56 micrograms/ml against 20 strains of s. aureus isolated from patients who received this drug, and this value was similar to those for ccl, amoxicillin (ampc) and dmppc. as regards to streptococcus pyogenes, mic of s-1006 was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against 449 clinical isolates in our culture collection and 7 strains obtained from patients  who received this drug, and these mics are similar to those of cefteram (cftm). mics of s-1006 against 5 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae obtained from patients who received this drug were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml, 0.10 microgram/ml or 0.39 microgram/ml which are similar to those of cftm. mics of s-1006 against 4 strains of haemophilus influenzae obtained from patients who received this drug were 0.05 or 0.10 microgram/ml which are similar to those of cftm. 2. when s-1108 granule preparation was administered to 1 patient at 4.0 mg/kg, the peak plasma concentration of s-1006 was 1.25 microgram/ml. s-1108 granule preparation was also administered to 2 patients at 6.0 mg/kg, and the peak plasma concentrations  were 2.43 micrograms/ml and 2.23 micrograms/ml. plasma half-lives were 1.11 hours after 4.0 mg/kg and 1.28 hours in both patients given 6.0 micrograms/ml. aucs were 4.06, 8.37 and 7.73 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. a dose-response relationship was observed between the two doses. 3. urinary concentration was the highest during the 4-6-hour period for a patient given 4.0 mg/kg, and during the  0-2-hour or 4-6-hour period for 2 patients given 6.0 mg/kg. the peak concentrations were 258.0, 602.0 and 500.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, and urinary recovery rates during the 0-8-hour period were 38.9, 38.3 and 23.1%, respectively. 4. clinical effects were excellent or good in 88 of 93 patients, showing a very high efficacy rate of 94.6%.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [clinical study of s-1108 fine granule in the pediatric field].
AB  == s-1108 in a fine granular form was administered in 14 children and its safety and efficacy in bacterial infections were evaluated. among them, 2 cases of cystitis  and 1 case of pneumonia were considered unevaluable for the efficacy. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 81.8% in the eleven evaluable cases treated with s-1108 fine granules including 5 cases of pharyngitis, 2 cases each of tonsillitis, pertussis and cystitis. 2. bacteriological efficacy of 100% was achieved against pathogens identified in 5 children including 1 case each of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae and 2 cases of escherichia coli. 3. the only abnormal  laboratory test results observed were eosinophilia and leukocytopenia in one case each. diarrhea was recorded in 1 case. judging from the above results, it appears that s-1108 in the fine granular form is an effective, useful and safe antibiotic of first choice for the treatment of infections in the pediatric field.

AB  == a bacterial lysate (om-85 bv), a preparation of purified bacterial ribosomes (d53) and a placebo were tested for ability to induce the local appearance of specific antibody-containing cells. the three compounds were given orally to 90 children who required tonsillectomy. surgery was carried out after 1 month of therapy. frozen-cut sections of each tonsil were tested in indirect immunofluorescence. cells containing antibodies directed to streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae or klebsiella pneumoniae were enumerated. lowest values were noted in the placebo group. slightly higher numbers were observed after treatment with om-85 bv, but significant increases were noted only for the elevated numbers of specific antibody-containing cells observed after d53 therapy. bacterial ribosomal preparations thus contribute efficient induction of specific local immune responses in man.

TI  == cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized  n-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria rapidly. in addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. it has good affinity for pbps 2 and 3 of escherichia coli and for pbp 3 of pseudomonas aeruginosa. its broad-spectrum of activity includes gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. it is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against enterobacteriaceae. the mic90 for p. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those  of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. other gram-negative organisms, haemophilus influenzae, neiserria meningitidis, neiserria gonorrhoeae, moraxella  catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. among gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, streptococcus pneumoniae  and streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant enterobacteriaceae. only strains of p. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. in experimental infections such as meningitis, induced  with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of cdzm and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide  medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. the followings are a summary of the results: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter diversus, most of klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. some strains of klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant escherichia coli seemed likely. among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including cdzm and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. mic90's of cdzm against streptococcus spp., h. infleunzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp. and p. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. this indicates that cdzm would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. however, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant s. pneumoniae, cephem resistant e. coli and cephem resistant k. oxytoca with cdzm. 3. among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of cdzm with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. antibacterial activities of cdzm we observed in this study seem to indicate that  cdzm concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above mic levels for relatively long periods of time.

TI  == prevalence of bacterial respiratory pathogens in the nasopharynx in breast-fed versus formula-fed infants.
AB  == in several studies, breast-feeding has been associated with decreased frequency or duration of otitis media episodes. if a causal relationship exists, the mechanism of protection of breast-feeding has not been established. we hypothesized that infants who are breast-fed, compared with infants who are formula-fed, have a lower prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization with the bacterial respiratory pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes) commonly isolated from the middle ear effusions of children with acute otitis media. in two private pediatric practices, we obtained specimens from the nasopharynx for culture from  211 infants at 1 month of age and from 173 of these infants at 2 months of age. a swab was left in place in the nasopharynx for 45 s and was then immediately transferred onto appropriate culture media. exclusively breast-fed (n = 84) and exclusively formula-fed (n = 76) infants were similar regarding the number of persons in the household, the number of children in the household, the number of  siblings in day care, and the proportion with a recent upper respiratory tract infection. the two groups did not differ significantly in the proportions found to have one or more respiratory pathogens at 1 month of age (10.7 versus 18.4%; p = 0.12) or 2 months of age (34.8 versus 35.1%; p = 0.57). we conclude that during the first 2 months after birth, the exclusive receipt of breast milk appears not  to substantially influence the prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization with common bacterial respiratory pathogens.

AB  == acute respiratory infections are primary causes of morbidity and mortality in children in developing countries. this project was designed to investigate antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens isolated from children in rural and city areas, and to contribute to the rational choice of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections in children in ethiopia. nasopharynx and throat cultures were taken from all children under five years of age in three study areas representing different levels of contact with health care and accessibility to modern drugs, such as antibiotics. in all, 1126 children were cultured. haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae were both found in  85-90% of the children, and beta-haemolytic streptococci group a in 12%. the level of antimicrobial resistance was low. none of the 954 strains of h. influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. pneumococci were susceptible to penicillin. the use of antibiotics was also low; 11 of 1126 children had antibiotics on the day of culture or the day before. the choice of antibiotics was not limited by resistance, and emphasis could be put on low cost, minimizing  adverse drug reactions and ecological impact.

TI  == effect of specific bacteria on lymphocyte proliferation in diseased and nondiseased tonsils.
AB  == tonsillar tissue lymphocyte (ttl) function as measured by lymphocyte proliferation was assessed in vitro in 38 tonsils--30 diseased and 8 normal controls. ttls from diseased and control tonsils were challenged with intact, heat-inactivated bacteria which may be found in the core of diseased tonsils; these bacteria were streptococcus pyogenes and hemophilus influenzae type b (hib), as well as the dominant bacterium (db) grown from that particular tonsillar core. the phytomitogen leukoagglutinin (la) was used as a nonspecific activator. lymphocyte proliferation was quantified and reported using a stimulation index (si) which was based upon viable cell counts at 2, 4, and 6 days following inoculation. overall, the greatest degree of lymphocyte proliferation in diseased ttls (si = .91) was produced by hib. however, both sp and hib produced more lymphocyte proliferation in the nondiseased ttls than in the diseased ttls (p < .01). h influenzae (non-b) and group a beta-hemolytic streptococci were the pathogens most frequently cultured as the dominant bacteria from the core of diseased tonsils; streptococcus viridans was most frequently cultured in nondiseased tonsils. the db caused greater ttl proliferation in diseased (si = .89) versus control (si = .63) ttls (p < .001). these findings suggest a differential proliferative response in vitro for diseased and nondiseased ttls in response to specific bacteria. the role of possibly pathogenic bacteria and commensals, as well as the implications for clinical disease, are discussed.

AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for sultamicillin (sbtpc), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated  strains collected from outpatients during a period from august, 1992 to february, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of penicillinase  (pcase)-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 12.0%. mic90 of sbtpc against s. aureus including mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. no increasing tendency was observed for s. aureus resistant to sbtpc. 2. no resistant strains were found among streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (pcs) including sbtpc. but pcs and cephems (ceps) insensitive or resistant streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of s. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. sbtpc showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. however, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of e. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "extended broad-spectrum". mics of sbtpc and ceps against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. the results of the study suggested that the resistant  strains of s. pneumoniae against pcs and ceps might be increasing year by year. some of strains of e. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. it is  important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. it is, however, also confirmed that sbtpc shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. taking into consideration of the strong activities of sbtpc against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, sbtpc may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.

TI  == review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == adult response to initial treatment with ampicillin in community acquired pneumonia in yaounde, cameroon.
AB  == a prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ampicillin as an initial therapy in 60 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia. bacteriological etiology was obtained only in 24 (40pc) patients by microscopic examination, culture and antigen detection. streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading causative agent identified in 15 cases. other etiologies were klebsiella  pneumoniae (3), streptococcus pyogenes (2) staphylococcus aureus (2), haemophilus influenzae (1) and moraxella catarrhails (1). patients were started on ampicillin one gram twice daily, empirically, and treated for 10 days. there were 52(86.7pc) patients cured, two(3.3pc) patients improved and six (10pc) were therapeutic failures. the causative agents in patients with failures were: klebsiella pneumoniae (1), staphylococcus aureus (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and unknown in three cases. only six of 60 patients still febrile after three days were switched to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or cefaclor according to culture results and susceptibilities or to roxythromycin because no organisms were isolated. side effects were observed in only one (1.7pc) patient who developed a  mild skin rash. due to its low cost and its high efficacy, ampicillin still appears to be the drug of choice in adult community acquired pneumonia in our region.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy of skin and soft tissue infection in children.
AB  == skin and soft tissue infection and cutaneous abscesses are common in children. they may be polymicrobial in nature, especially when located proximal to mucous membranes. a general knowledge of the common causative bacterial organisms in these infections enables the physician to empirically institute antimicrobial therapy before culture results are available. this review assesses the number and types of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that occur in skin and soft tissue infections in children. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were recovered from infections occurring at all body sites, but predominated in infections of the leg, neck, and hand. group d streptococci, enterobacteriaceae,  neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, and prevotella species were isolated mostly from infections of the external genitalia and perirectal areas; pigmented  prevotella and porphyromonas and haemophilus influenzae can be isolated from infections of the head and neck. management of skin and soft tissue infections in children should include surgical and medical therapy.

TI  == selection of dose regimens of azithromycin .
AB  == the unique pharmacokinetics of azithromycin are characterized by high, sustained  tissue concentrations. the concentrations of azithromycin were predicted, following various multiple dose regimens, from concentrations in tonsillar, prostatic, and uterine tissues following single oral doses. following a five-day  treatment regimen (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg on days 2-5), or a three-day regimen (500 mg daily for three days), concentrations of azithromycin in tonsillar tissue, representative of respiratory tract tissues, will continuously be greater than the mics for key target pathogens (streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus) in infections of the respiratory tract for up to 10 days. since tissue concentrations above the mics for infecting organisms were correlated with efficacy in animal models of infection, short treatment regimens consisting of once-daily oral administration  of azithromycin should be effective in the treatment of a variety of infections.  a single 1 g oral dose will provide concentrations in the uterus and prostate, representing urogenital tissues, above the mic for chlamydia trachomatis for approximately 10 days. thus, this regimen should be effective in the treatment of chlamydial infections of the genital tract.

TI  == loracarbef. a review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy.
AB  == loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. at low concentrations (< 2 mg/l) in vitro, it inhibits streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups b, c and g. proteus mirabilis and moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. at therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus,  escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of haemophilus influenzae. like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. when administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis.  loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. it is administered twice daily. it offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == cefprozil. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  == cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. it is particularly active against the gram-positive organisms streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. cefprozil is also moderately active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, many enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. in comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg  or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract  infections. the clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in  patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. in children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. the most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. while cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the  treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.

TI  == review of cefixime in the treatment of otitis media in infants and children.
AB  == during the past decade there has been an increase in the percentage of resistant  bacteria isolated from middle-ear effusions aspirated from infants and children who have had acute otitis media. at least nine oral antibiotics or combination agents are available for this indication. cefixime, a third generation cephalosporin, has excellent in vitro activity against both beta-lactamase-negative and beta-lactamase-positive haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, good activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes but relatively poor activity against staphylococcus aureus. in children cefixime is similar in effectiveness to amoxicillin and cefaclor, but diarrhea and stool changes are more common with cefixime. amoxicillin is still preferred for initial empiric treatment of uncomplicated acute otitis media. its major drawback is limited efficacy when beta-lactamase-producing bacteria are the causative organisms. cefixime is a viable alternative to amoxicillin for infants and children with acute otitis media when: (1) a beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae or m. catarrhalis is isolated from otorrhea or tympanocentesis; (2) the child has a history of delayed hypersensitivity to the penicillins but no history of hypersensitivity to the cephalosporins; (3) there is a high incidence of resistant bacteria in the community; (4) there is not clinical improvement with amoxicillin; or (5) once daily administration is more convenient.

TI  == [penetration into bone and joint tissues of rabbits and in vitro antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin].
AB  == the penetration of tosufloxacin (tflx) into the bone and joint tissues of rabbits and its in vitro antibacterial activity were compared with those of lomefloxacin  (lflx) which is a efficacious drug for orthopedic infections. serum levels of tflx at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after oral administration (100 mg/kg) were 0.41, 0.65, 0.62 and 0.42 micrograms/ml, respectively. except in synovial fluid and femur, tflx concentrations in bone and joint tissues were higher than those in serum (0.69 approximately 1.92 micrograms/g in bone marrow of sternum, 0.55 approximately 1.53 micrograms/g in bone marrow of femur). tflx concentrations in  synovial fluid at 4 and 6 hours after the administration were equal to those in serum, which were lower than those of lflx, but the ratio of tissue level/serum level of tflx was similar to that of lflx. tflx was 8- to 64-fold more active than lflx against staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, which are major pathogens of purulent osteomyelitis and arthritis. tflx inhibited the growth of these bacteria at less than 0.39 micrograms/ml. these results indicate that tflx  is a useful drug for orthopedic infection.

TI  == susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens in finland to cefixime and nine other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefixime and 9 other orally used antimicrobial agents against 545 selected clinical respiratory tract pathogens was tested using the plate-dilution method. of the strains tested, 144 were haemophilus influenzae strains, 151 group a streptococci, 105 pneumococci and 145 moraxella catarrhalis  isolates. ciprofloxacin was the most active drug, with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of < 0.06 mg/l for more than 87% of the isolates. with cefixime, a mic of 0.06 mg/l inhibited 55% of the strains tested and a mic of 1.0 mg/l inhibited all except one of the 545 strains. one pneumococcal strain was resistant to cefixime. beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis  strains were clearly more susceptible to cefixime than to other oral cephalosporins (cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime). however, penicillin, ampicillin and cefuroxime were more effective against beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci than was cefixime. the new third generation cephalosporin, cefixime, showed markedly better in vitro activity against certain major respiratory tract pathogens than the other peroral antimicrobials commonly used against respiratory tract infections.

AB  == the authors studied antimicrobial activities of cefetamet (cfmt) and other leading oral antimicrobials of beta-lactam class against clinically isolated strains from urban respiratory tract infection (rti) patients from january to march, 1992. 1. cfmt showed potent antimicrobial activities against "3 primary pathogens" of rtis i.e., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, but the drug had a slightly higher mic than those of a few oxime-type cephems already on the market. 2. cfmt was as stable as cefixime to beta-lactamase, generated by moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, which reduces the antimicrobial activity of cephems. 3. blood concentrations of cfmt after administering cefetamet pivoxil (cfmt-pi), an oral form of the drug, exceeded the mic80 against the "3 primary pathogens" as well as m. (b) catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae, for a duration of approximately 9 and 11 hours, respectively, after single doses of 250 and 500 mg. this suggests that cfmt could remain above the mics for a sufficient time period with twice daily dosages of normal dose levels. 4. it is concluded that cfmt-pi will be useful for treating urban rtis.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == [the etiology of bacterial respiratory infections in adulthood].
AB  == upper and lower respiratory tract infections are the most frequently reported pathologies both in children and in adults. in particular, the most common clinical pictures are otitis media, principally chronic, and acute and chronic sinusitis. the microbiology of otitis media, which has been investigated thoroughly in the last year, confirmed a bacterial origin in 90% of the cases (while the incidence of the viral form is low). the etiologic agents responsible  for chronic infections are gram-negative bacteria, staphylococci and anaerobic bacteria, while in the acute forms, which are rare in adults but frequent in children, the responsible pathogens are principally haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes and branhamella catarrhalis. among the etiologic agents of chronic sinusitis, which, from a clinical point of view, is the most frequently observed, there are staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes and many anaerobic bacteria. as regards lower respiratory tract infections, chronic bronchitis is the most frequent pathology in adults. but, in this case, the etiologic agents are more difficult to identify. analysing the above-mentioned clinical pictures and their relevant etiologic agents, among the different therapeutic proposals, one of the most innovative and recent is represented by azithromycin. azithromycin is the first of a new class of macrolides termed "azalides" which shows particular microbiological and pharmacokinetic characteristics. as compared to other macrolides, it has an higher distribution volume, a longer half-life, a  deeper intracellular penetration and a wider spectrum of action. it is rapidly concentrated in leukocytes pmn, monocytes, macrophages and fibroblasts and slowly released by these cells to the infected tissues. azithromycin concentrations in tissues and sites of infection can be increased by the phagocyte uptake.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of loracarbef and effects of susceptibility test methods.
AB  == loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. a review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values (microgram/ml) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; m. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; h. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; escherichia coli, 2.0-25; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; s. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. the in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the results of in vitro susceptibility tests with  any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. this is particularly true with h. influenzae. furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.

TI  == criteria for evaluation of antimicrobial agents and current therapies for acute sinusitis in children.
AB  == acute sinusitis is a common complication of upper respiratory tract infections in children. the primary causative bacteria are haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci. concurrent viral infection may confound interpretation of the clinical response to antimicrobial treatment. first-line antimicrobial treatment is usually with amoxicillin. the increase in frequency of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in some communities, however, may warrant empirical treatment with other drugs such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefixime, or cefuroxime. with the marketing of newer antimicrobial drugs for treating sinusitis, it is important for physicians  to understand the criteria for evaluating the efficacy of each new drug in relation to existing antimicrobial agents. criteria for clinical and bacteriologic evaluation of new antimicrobial drugs in the treatment of sinusitis in children are described.

TI  == parameters characterizing the in vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral broad spectrum cephalosporin, against respiratory and urinary pathogens.
AB  == the wide and potent in vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral broad spectrum cephalosporin, has been confirmed on a collection of respiratory and urinary pathogens recently isolated in italy. the new cephem emerged as the most bactericidal of all the comparators tested against several fast as well as slowly-growing gram-negative species including enterobacteria, haemophilus and moraxella, irrespective of their ability to synthetize beta-lactamases. among the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were effectively covered. cefixime activity was not adversely influenced by several important variables such as ph (over the range from 5 to 8), inoculum size (from 10(5) to 10(8) cfu per ml) and the presence of 50% human serum or urine. time-kill tests confirmed a pronounced bactericidal potency of the drug especially towards common respiratory pathogens (h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes). killing of urinary strains was optimal at cefixime concentrations reached in urine since eradication, except for proteus mirabilis, was enhanced with increasing levels of the drug. the absence of an untoward paradoxic effect on the rate of cefixime bactericidal action was confirmed by employing a dynamic  bladder model simulating the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug after a single 200 mg daily dosage. interactions of cefixime with several other drugs that may be employed in combination therapy were generally prone to provide indifference and synergism while antagonism was never observed. favorable interactions were also registered when cefixime acted with other antibiotics on partially resistant species such as staphylococci and pseudomonas. the new cephem seems to provide excellent opportunities for expanding oral cephalosporin therapy to a wide range of infections produced by susceptible pathogens in the adult and  pediatric populations.

TI  == [bacteriological and clinical studies on meropenem in the pediatric field].
AB  == bacteriological and clinical studies have been performed on meropenem (mepm, sm-7338), a newly developed carbapenem antibiotic, in the pediatric field. 1. antibacterial activities of mepm against 24 clinical isolates were determined. mepm showed excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria, especially escherichia coli and branhamella catarrhalis. against haemophilus influenzae, mepm had a higher activity than imipenem and flomoxef, but had a lower activity than piperacillin and cefoperazone. 2. clinical efficacies of mepm were evaluated in 32 cases with  bacterial infections. a poor efficacy was observed in 1 patient with phlegmon but excellent or good efficacies were obtained in other 31 patients with tonsillitis  (1), pneumonia (17), uti (12), or ssss (1). the overall efficacy rate was 96.9%.  all strains except 1 of s. aureus were eradicated by the administration of mepm,  and a high eradication rate of 95.8% (23 out of 24 strains) was obtained. 3. no side effects were observed in 35 evaluated cases. as abnormal laboratory test results, elevated got, elevated gpt, eosinophilia and neutropenia were noted in 4, 4, 4 and 2 patients, respectively. 4. influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. pivka ii was elevated upon administration of mepm in some cases, but no changes in att, tt, hpt or fbg were observed during the treatment. based on the above results, it has been concluded that mepm is a safe  and effective drug to use in the treatment of pediatric infections. the usual recommended dosage and administration should be 10 to 20 mg/kg of mepm at a time, using intravenous drip infusion, 3 times a day.

AB  == in a randomized crossover trial, six volunteers received 200- and 400-mg doses of loracarbef (ly 163892), a new oral cephalosporin. mean +/- standard error of the  mean concentrations in serum obtained after 1.5 and 3 h were 13.2 +/- 2.8 and 4.3 +/- 0.7 mg/liter, respectively, after the 400-mg dose and 6.9 +/- 1.0 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/liter, respectively, after the 200-mg dose. bactericidal reciprocal titers measured against respiratory pathogens in serum suggested that loracarbef would be highly effective against streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes (median titers, 8 to 128 at 1.5 h and less than 2 to 32 at 3 h) and beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae (median titers, 4 at 1.5 h and 2 to 4 at 3 h). other species (branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus anginosus, staphylococcus aureus) were associated with lower bactericidal titers. killing curves performed against 12 strains demonstrated that the bioactivity of loracarbef (measured by the reduction in the area under the control growth curve) was significantly correlated with the concentration/mic ratio, whereas the initial rate of killing was not, once the concentration was greater than the mic. our results suggest that administration of 400 mg of loracarbef every 8 h might be associated with more favorable pharmacodynamic parameters against target bacteria.

AB  == the in vitro activity of fleroxacin, a new trifluorinated quinolone was evaluated against 432 bacterial isolates. fleroxacin was 1- to 2-fold less active than ciprofloxacin and at least as active as ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the mics of fleroxacin for 90% of strains tested (mic90) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml against all isolates of enterobacteriaceae except citrobacter freundii (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) and serratia marcescens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml). fleroxacin was as active as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against pseudomonas spp, (mic90 for all quinolones tested were > 8 micrograms/ml). acinetobacter and haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to fleroxacin; however fleroxacin was 1-fold less active than lomefloxacin against acinetobacter and at least 1-fold less active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against h. influenzae. methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus epidermidis and  methicillin-susceptible strains of s. aureus were very susceptible to fleroxacin, with an mic90 < or = 1 microgram/ml (range 0.5-1 microgram/ml). methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus spp. other than aureus and epidermidis were not susceptible to fleroxacin (mic90 > 8 micrograms/ml). in addition, fleroxacin as well as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin were inactive against enterococcus spp. (mic90 > 8 micrograms/ml). streptococcus pneumoniae and s. pyogenes were resistant to both fleroxacin and lomefloxacin but were very susceptible to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. these results suggest that  fleroxacin represents a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of infections caused by most enterobacteriaceae and some species of staphylococcus.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bay y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  == bay y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as bacteriodes fragilis and clostridium perfringens. mic90s for s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, and s. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant s. aureus, mic50 levels of bay y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. the potency of bay y3118 against all members of the enterobacteriaceae generally  was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. bay y3118 was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on mic determinations. the drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference mbcs and time-kill curves. from the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.

TI  == lack of emergence of significant resistance in vitro and in vivo to the new azalide antibiotic azithromycin.
AB  == in vitro experiments were performed in which 6 to 12 strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae were passaged nine times in sub-lethal concentrations of azithromycin or control  antibiotics. streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus quickly became resistant to rifampin as the mic90 increased from 0.1 to greater than 50 micrograms/ml for both species. the mic90 of azithromycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin and cefaclor increased by three dilutions for staphylococcus aureus.  the mic values of azithromycin for streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae strains did not change significantly. however, for haemophilus influenzae and the enterobacteriaceae strains, the mic values of erythromycin and oral cephalosporins increased four-fold. in the in vivo experiments, mice infected with staphylococcus aureus or escherichia coli contaminated sutures were administered azithromycin for three days, and on day 6  viable bacterial cells were recovered from the infection site. the sustained tissue concentrations of azithromycin indicated that the organisms would have been continuously exposed to azithromycin at the site of infection. colonies isolated from azithromycin-treated and non-treated mice were cultured and their susceptibility to azithromycin compared. the azithromycin mic values for staphylococcus aureus cultures from treated and non-treated animals were identical. the azithromycin mics for escherichia coli recovered from treated animals were on average, less than one dilution higher than for control cultures. emergence of significant resistance to azithromycin in the laboratory was not observed with the pathogens tested.

TI  == [bactericide activity of cefadroxil comparated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,  cefaclor and josamycin].
AB  == betalactamase-producing organisms are responsible for an increasing number of ent and lower respiratory tract infections. or cephalosporins and the combination of  amoxicillin with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid are alternatives to ampicillin therapy. the killing activity of cefadroxil on the organisms most often responsible for ent and respiratory infections was evaluated in vitro using a viable bacteria count method, comparatively with cefaclor, josamycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. killing activity was found to be time-dependent for  all the antimicrobial agents studied. cefadroxil exhibited the same bactericidal  effect on streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae than the other agents. haemophilus influenzae and an increasing number of pneumococcus strains were resistant to josamycin which is therefore not appropriate for first-line therapy. as compared with amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefadroxil was less active on h. influenzae and more active on staphylococcus aureus. production of beta-lactamase failed to influence the killing activity of cefadroxil. these bacteriologic data, together with results of pharmacologic studies (long half-life and good penetration within tissues) can explain the clinical successes obtained with cefadroxil in ent and lower respiratory tract infections.

AB  == in the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (cpm), its minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions  were obtained. 1. microbial strains in which no cpm-resistant strains emerged were streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. 2. in comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to cpm were staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to cpm was observed in high ratios. 3. among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that cpm could not exert sufficient  antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "cpm-resistant strains". 4. it was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including cpm. 5. there are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of cpm to clinically isolated strains  in recent years. however, it was jointly confirmed that cpm maintained effective  antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. furthermore, when it was additionally considered that cpm was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that cpm was  one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.

AB  == one hundred and twenty-six patients who underwent tonsillectomy because of recurrent acute tonsillitis, tonsillar hypertrophy or sleep apnoea were evaluated by tonsillar core culturing. the sleep apnoea patients served as controls, since  none of them had tonsillar hypertrophy at ent examination or any history of recurrent acute tonsillitis, and thus their tonsillar core flora could be regarded as normal. the isolation rate of h. influenzae was much lower among sleep apnoea controls (2.7 per cent) than among either the patients with recurrent acute tonsillitis (20.3 per cent) or those with tonsillar hypertrophy (36.7 per cent) (p less than 0.05), as was that of group a streptococci, 5.4 per  cent versus 16.9 and 20 per cent, respectively (though the latter differences were not statistically significant). the isolation frequencies of b. catarrhalis, pneumococci, group c and g streptococci did not differ between the three groups.  the high tonsillar core recovery rates of h. influenzae and group a streptococci  both in patients with recurrent acute tonsillitis and in those with tonsillar hypertrophy, as compared with normal controls, suggests the possible involvement  of these bacteria in both conditions.

AB  == ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were  inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.

TI  == activity of temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens.
AB  == the activity of the quinolone temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. mics for 90% of strains tested indicated that temafloxacin was at least two- to fourfold more potent than the other two quinolones against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and legionella pneumophila. temafloxacin had potency equal to that of ciprofloxacin and was twofold more active than ofloxacin against streptococcus pyogenes. moraxella catarrhalis, and bordetella pertussis. against haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, temafloxacin was four- and twofold less potent than ciprofloxacin, respectively. when administered orally in mouse protection tests against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and s. pyogenes, temafloxacin  was at least eight times more potent than ciprofloxacin and was two to four times more active than ofloxacin. against h. influenzae, temafloxacin was as active as  ofloxacin and was two times less active than ciprofloxacin following oral administration in mice. in treating l. pneumophila in guinea pigs and h. influenzae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ofloxacin were more effective than ciprofloxacin. against s. pneumoniae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active than ofloxacin. following subcutaneous administration in mice, temafloxacin achieved higher lung levels than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin did.

TI  == the relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  == fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. the accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. the results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. conversely, the tonsil  core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. surface bacteria may not,  however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. implications  for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of gr69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  == gr69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (mic90). it had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and e-1040. against cephalosporinase-producing enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens, mics ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and  cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to gr69153, and for this organism the mic90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the e-1040 mic90, but most pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. gr69153 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. for staphylococcus aureus gr69153 mics were similar to those of ceftazidime and e-1040. enterococci and listeriae were resistant to gr69153, but streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. the activity of gr69153 was not affected by serum. gr69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, and bro-1, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-9, and morganellae. gr69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. it is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. gr69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.

TI  == cefixime shows good effects on group a and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci.
AB  == there is continued interest in the development of oral beta-lactam compounds, which can be used clinically to treat various bacterial infections, particularly  those caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci. cefixime is a new orally active cephalosporin, with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. cefixime is highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases. in this study the authors examined the effects of this molecule on group a and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci, recently isolated from clinical specimens in the authors' laboratory. mics and the growth curves of 36 strains of group a streptococci and the effects of sub-mics on buccal cell adhesion were evaluated. the results show that concerning the sub-mic cefixime effect on streptococci adherence, the treatment led to a decrease in adherence to the cells of the strains studied. moreover cefixime showed good activity with 86.1% of the strains with mic less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, and the growth curves demonstrated that the molecule possesses a bactericidal effect after 3 h. concerning group b streptococci, 70.3% of the strains showed a mic less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. in conclusion cefixime demonstrates good activity on beta-haemolytic streptococci, particularly those of group a.

TI  == bronchial hyperresponsiveness and bacterial respiratory infections.
AB  == some studies suggest a potential role for bacterial respiratory tract infections  in the development of bronchospasm and the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). patients with bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis have exaggerated airway reactivity; croup in children can also cause exaggerated upper and lower airway responsiveness. bronchial obstruction after inhalation of haemophilus influenzae and other bacteria has been reported. between january 1989 and june 1990 we and two other centers studied 193 patients suffering from acute  exacerbation of asthma. fifty-two (27%) of these patients had bacteria in their sputum. streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus,  moraxella catarrhalis, and h influenzae were the most commonly isolated bacterial species. antibiotics may be of value in the treatment of infective lung disease,  not only by killing bacteria but also by preventing increases in bacterial histamine levels within the lung airways. moreover, an antibiotic of proven efficacy can reduce airway reactivity in patients with bacterial exacerbations of copd or bronchial asthma. in 12 patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of asthma and high airway reactivity to methacholine, a ten-day course of treatment  with cefaclor and existing bronchodilators induced microbiologic cure and a slight but nonsignificant change in airway reactivity in nine patients. antibiotic therapy has a minor but clear role in the control of acquired bronchial hyperreactivity during bacterial respiratory infections in asthmatic patients; however, because of airway inflammation, an antibiotic's efficacy is evident only when the inflammatory process subsides. approaches designed to minimize airway reactivity may contribute to the prevention or reversal of respiratory failure during exacerbation of copd and bronchial asthma.

TI  == the sore throat. when to investigate and when to prescribe.
AB  == sore throats are most commonly due to infections, many of which are viral and do  not require specific treatment. symptoms and signs of the common cold, influenza  or croup, the occurrence of conjunctivitis in some adenoviral infections, generalised lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in glandular fever or the presence of vesicles characteristic of herpangina (coxsackie a virus) or of herpes simplex infection, occasionally enable a clinical diagnosis and avoid the need for antibiotic therapy. in the case of treatable conditions a typical membrane may suggest diphtheria, a scarlatiniform rash infection due to streptococcus pyogenes or to corynebacterium haemolyticum, and a cherry-red epiglottis haemophilus influenzae type b. associated atypical pneumonia suggests infection with mycoplasma pneumoniae or chlamydia pneumoniae. pharyngitis due to neisseria gonorrhoeae may be accompanied by infection at other sites or by other sexually transmitted diseases. candidal infection, in the appropriate clinical circumstance, should suggest hiv infection. surgical drainage is required in the  case of peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess. noninfectious cases of sore throat, e.g. thyroiditis, are relatively uncommon considerations in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile pharyngitis. the most common problem is to recognise streptococcal pharyngitis, which requires antibiotic treatment for 10 days to avoid the risk of rheumatic fever.

AB  == we determined the mics of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of escherichia coli, 66 strains of  klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of serratia marcescens, 12 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in tohoku district of  japan during the period from january to april in 1989. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against s. aureus, b. catarrhalis, p. aeruginosa and a. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. ampicillin and cefteram were more active against s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes than other antibiotics. new-quinolones and  cephems of new-generation were active against h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and s. marcescens. of 30 strains of s. aureus which were resistant (mic greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (mic greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. twenty strains (6.5%) of s. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of h.  influenzae were resistant (mic greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. of 101 strains of h. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. the above results indicated that mrsa is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.

AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in tohoku district of japan during the period from january to april in 1989 was documented. of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. the rate of recovery of potential  pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. these patients had elevated body-temperature. there were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. the rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in  patients with fever. of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and  acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. in this group there were 39 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of escherichia coli, 97 strains of klebsiella spp., 40 strains of enterobacter spp., 25 strains of serratia spp., 12 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of pseudomonas putida. there was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. the above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin bay  v 3522.
AB  == the activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to mics of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. it was more active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. groups b, c and g streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the mi"90 for streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for enterococci and listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most bacteroides spp. were resistant. the mic90 for beta-lactamase positive escherichia coli (producing primarily tem-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. the mic90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus  mirabilis, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. bay v 3522 was destroyed by tem-1, shv-1, tem-3 and p99 beta-lactamases.

TI  == comparative study on the macrolides erythromycin and clarithromycin: antibacterial activity and influence on immune responses.
AB  == the in vitro activity of erythromycin and clarithromycin (a new macrolide antibiotic) on clinical bacterial isolates as well as their effects on the cellular and humoral immune responses in balb/c-mice and on human granulocytes/monocytes was investigated. treatment of balb/c-mice for 7 days with these drugs did not influence the delayed type hypersensitivity to oxazolone nor  the production of igg and igm immunoglobulins. in vitro, exposure of granulocytes to erythromycin resulted in increased phagocytosis only in higher concentrations  (20 mcg/ml), whereas clarithromycin enhanced chemiluminescence response of granulocytes in concentrations ranging from 2.5-20 mcg/ml. subinhibitory concentrations of both substances modified staphylococcus aureus and made them more susceptible for granulocyte phagocytosis.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of six new oral cephem antibiotics.
AB  == six newly developed oral cephem antibiotics, which included 5 with an aminothiazolyl side chain, viz., cefixime, cefotiam hexetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefteram pivoxil, ceftibuten, and one with a conventional side chain design, bmy 28100, were tested for their antimicrobial activities. three traditional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, were used as reference antibiotics. the 5 aminothiazolyl cephems were more active than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. all 6 new drugs showed poor activity against clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. they were better than cephalexin and cefaclor, but slightly poorer than or the same as ampicillin in activities against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. cefotiam hexetil, bmy 28100, and cefpodoxime proxetil were also more active than cephalexin against staphylococcus aureus. although the 6 tested new oral cephems demonstrated little difference in their activities against different bacteria, they all showed greater antimicrobial activity than the traditional oral antibiotics now in clinical use.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil was studied in an in-vitro model simulating doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg. strains of klebsiella spp. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, and haemophilus influenzae were effectively reduced by a dose of 200 mg. while for esch. coli no dose-activity relationship was observed--the maximal effect was achieved with a simulated dose of 100 mg--staphylococcus aureus could be reduced effectively only by a simulated dose of 400 mg. the lower doses showed stepwise lower activities.  apart from broad spectrum beta-lactamases like shv 2 or tem 5 the presence of plasmid coded beta-lactamases in esch. coli and h. influenzae did not affect the  antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil. the results show that cefpodoxime was more active against gram-negative bacteria than amoxycillin, and comparable activity to intramuscular cefotiam in the in-vitro model.

TI  == [activity of cefuroxime against bacterial strains isolated from acute otitis media].
AB  == the acute otitis media is a frequent infantile disease and, in 80% of cases, a bacterial strain can be isolated from the otorrhoea. haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae are the two major species isolated from auricular exudate, and represent two thirds of all isolated strains, with the others comprising staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae and corynebacteria. the treatment of this disease  is based principally on beta-lactams (aminopenicillins, cephalosporins) administered by the oral route. cefuroxime is a cephalosporin which is absorbed via the digestive tract in the form of cefuroxim-axetil. the activity of this compound was studied against 210 strains isolated from otorrhoea, collected from  children who presented an acute otitis media during the first half of 1989. these strains were: 112 strains of h. influenzae, of which 23 produced a beta-lactamase; 21 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae; 3 strains of streptococcus pyogenes; 10 strains of branhamella catarrhalis of which 9 produced a beta-lactamase; 18 strains of s. aureus; 14 strains of enterobacteriaceae, and  32 strains of corynebacteria. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefuroxime-axetil was measured by dilution in agar. the mics of cefuroxime against h. influenzae were low and similar (mic 50 = 1 mg/l; mic 90 = 1 mg/l) regardless of whether the strain secreted a beta-lactamase. overall, 90% and 98%  of the 210 strains tested here were inhibited by 1 and 4 mg/l of cefuroxime respectively. these results show that the antibacterial spectrum of cefuroxime-axetil appears to be ideally suited to the bacterial strains isolated  from acute otitis media.

AB  == one hundred patients subjected to tonsillectomy because of recurrent acute tonsillitis or tonsillar hypertrophy were evaluated bacteriologically both with ordinary throat culturing and cultures from tonsillar cores. in 26% of the patients h. influenzae was isolated and in 20% beta-haemolytic group a streptococci. growth of b. catarrhalis was obtained in 10% and group c-, group g  streptococci or pneumococci in less than 5% each. none of the group a streptococcal strains proved tolerant to penicillin. a much higher isolation rate of h. influenzae was found in cultures obtained from tonsillar core tissue (23%)  than from ordinary throat cultures (2%). this was also the fact, though to a lower extent, regarding group a streptococci. h. influenzae and group a streptococci were isolated as often in patients with tonsillar hypertrophy as in  patients suffering from recurrent acute tonsillitis, suggesting a role of these bacteria in both conditions.

AB  == during 1983-87, tympanostomy tubes were inserted in a total of 4952 ears of 2575  children remitted to the ent department of our hospital because of chronic or recurrent otitis media problems. the children were included in a prospective study and referred to one of three groups for comparison of findings. group 1 included all 6- to 12-month-old infants undergoing primary tube treatment; group  2, all children 1 year or older who had their first ventilation tube(s) inserted  in connection with adenoidectomy; and group 3, all children in whom tympanostomy  had been performed one or more times previously. middle ear effusion was aspirated from 2392 ears (48%); 67.6% of all ears were negative for bacteria and  22.1% of the ears with effusion grew pathogenic bacteria. s. pneumoniae was the most frequently cultured pathogen among the 6 to 12 month olds in group 1, but in groups 2 and 3 h. influenzae occurred more frequently than s. pneumoniae. beta-lactamase-producing strains of pathogenic bacteria were formed in only 4% of all ears with effusion: h. influenzae in 1.2% and b. catarrhalis in 2.8%. compared with figures from the united states, the frequency of beta-lactamase-producing strains is low in the present series. this is probably explained by differences in antimicrobial treatment practices; in finland and the scandinavian countries, penicillin v is the primary drug for acute otitis media.  in light of present results, it seems well-suited for treatment of otitis media in young children.

AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in sendai city  during the period from march in 1988 to february in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. three hundred strains of potential (greater  than or equal to 10(7) cfu/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. many strains of staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. on the other hand many strains of branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. the sensitivity of 45  antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (eiken, japan). no strain of the haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. none of the streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. none of the staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. we conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.

TI  == cefixime. a review of its antibacterial activity. pharmacokinetic properties and  therapeutic potential.
AB  == cefixime, previously designated fk027, fr17027 and cl284635, is an orally active  cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro. it is particularly active against many enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and branhamella catarrhalis, and is resistant to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. cefixime has little activity  against staphylococcus aureus and is inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefixime is distinguished by its 3-hour elimination half-life which permits twice daily, or in many instances once daily, administration. comparative trials, though few, indicate that the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefixime 200 to 400mg daily administered as a single dose or in 2 divided doses, is comparable with that of multiple daily doses of co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole) or amoxycillin in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection, with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and cefaclor in acute lower respiratory tract infections, and with that of amoxycillin and cefroxidine in adult patients with acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis. several comparative trials  in children with acute otitis media demonstrate the similar effectiveness of cefixime 8 mg/kg daily (in 2 divided doses, or as a single daily dose), cefaclor  20 to 40 mg/kg daily and amoxycillin 40 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses. the most  frequently reported adverse effects, diarrhoea and stool changes, are usually mild to moderate in severity, transient, and mostly occur in the first few days of treatment with cefixime. thus, cefixime is an effective orally active cephalosporin with a relatively long elimination half-life permitting a simplified treatment regimen. it is a suitable alternative to cefaclor or amoxycillin in acute otitis media and acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and to amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a c-3 vinyl group. its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime,  and amoxicillin-clavulanate. fk482 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012  micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. it  did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. fk482 inhibited 90% of enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. although 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, and shigella  species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, fk482 was less active than cefixime against citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella, serratia, and providencia species, with mics for many isolates of greater than 8  micrograms/ml. fk482 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. bacteroides and pseudomonas species were resistant. fk482 was not hydrolyzed by the tem-1 and tem-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the proteus vulgaris enzyme. it had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem alp-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new penem derivative alp-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. for comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. alp-201 was found to be highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, propioni-bacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile were resistant to alp-201. when tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of alp-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. further investigations are warranted with alp-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  == cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (cftm) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is  a new oral cephem antibiotic. cftm-pi was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to cftm by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as cftm. a tablet form of this drug has been released in japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. we have determined mics  of 5 drugs (cftm, cephalexin (cex), cefaclor (ccl), ampicillin (abpc), erythromycin (em], against stock strains and mics of 6 drugs (cftm, cex, ccl, abpc, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to cftm-pi, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. a total of 149 strains included gram-positive cocci i.e. staphylococcus aureus (11), streptococcus pyogenes (85), streptococcus agalactiae (16) and streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and gram-negative rods i.e. haemophilus influenzae (11), bordetella pertussis (11), escherichia coli (9), proteus mirabilis (1) and morganella morganii (1). the granular form of cftm-pi was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years  10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. urinary concentrations and  its urinary recovery rates of t-2525a, a main metabolite of cftm, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). to study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4  times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. with regard to gram-positive cocci, mics of cftm against 11 fresh strains of s. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus cftm was equally effective to cex, but less active than the other drugs tested.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the tonsillar surface and core of children with recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis and children with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy was performed. no qualitative difference was found within the two population groups. haemophilus influenzae and bacteroides melaninogenicus were the most prevalent beta-lactamase-producing isolates in both groups. staphylococcus aureus had the highest rate of beta-lactamase production on the tonsillar surface of children with recurrent tonsillitis, while streptococcus pyogenes was more prevalent in the tonsillar surface cultures of children with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy. the bacterial density was high but not significantly different in both groups of children. the similar microbial composition and density of both groups and the higher rate of s pyogenes recovery may signify a subclinical disease or normal flora in children with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
AB  == antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (cftm) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. antibacterial  activities of cftm against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (ccl). 2. activities of cefixime (cfix) were superior to those of cftm against b. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to cftm against s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus. 3. activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of  ccl against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and s. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to cftm and cfix against most of gram-negative rods. 4. sultamicillin (sbtpc) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its mics did not exceed the mics of ampicillin by itself. sbtpc showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.

AB  == the present study was designed to investigate the effect of membrane proteoglycans (mpg) from klebsiella pneumoniae on the function of human natural killer (nk) cells. mpg combined with bacterial ribosomes from klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae, constitute a bacterial immunomodulator (ms d 53), currently in clinical use. human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) exposed in vitro to mpg or ms d 53 for 20 h showed enhanced nk cytotoxicity. augmentation of nk cytotoxicity depended upon a direct effect on nk cells, inasmuch as these compounds were also  effective on highly purified large granular lymphocytes (lgl). we also studied the effects of mpg on non-cytotoxic functions of nk cells, namely in vitro locomotion and production of il-1. mpg (and ms d 53) induced il-1 release in lgl. moreover, mpg-treated lgl showed enhanced locomotory activity, as assessed by measuring the penetration into nitrocellulose filters. the capacity of mpg (and ms d 53) to activate cytotoxic and noncytotoxic functions of nk cells may contribute to enhancement of nonspecific resistance in vivo after treatment with  this agent.

AB  == the bacterial flora of the nose and nasopharynx was studied in 86 healthy young men. common pathogens (haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae) were  isolated from only 6% of all 172 nasal cavities. the same pathogens were isolated from 27% of 86 nasopharyngeal samples. h. influenzae dominated over s. pneumoniae both in the nose and the nasopharynx. no culture either from the nose or nasopharynx grew streptococcus pyogenes. potentially pathogenic bacteria, non-group-a hemolytic streptococci and various groups of neisseria meningitidis were isolated from the nasopharynx in 20% of the subjects. according to the present study healthy adults do not carry group-a hemolytic streptococci in the nose and seldom if ever in the pharynx. thus, isolation of s. pyogenes by bacterial culture is suggestive of a bacterial infection by this agent at these sites. isolation of hemolytic streptococci other than group a from the pharynx does not necessarily indicate bacterial infection, and the same holds true for h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae.

AB  == because lack of criteria for staging and treatment of epiglottitis can lead to unnecessary morbidity and mortality, we have introduced a staging system for early classification and appropriate management of adult epiglottitis patients. we retrospectively staged 20 adults with epiglottitis to see in their final outcome would have been altered using our protocol. we found that staging and management according to our protocol were appropriate and possibly could have reduced mortality from 10% to nearly 0%.

TI  == immunomodulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes by d53 immucytal and its constitutive fractions.
AB  == d53 (immucytal) is a compositive vaccine made of immunogenic ribosomes extracted  from 4 bacterial species (klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae) associated with a membrane proteoglycan from a non-encapsulated strain of klebsiella pneumoniae (mpg-kp). in this work we have studied the effect of the compound on human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) function "in vitro". we have demonstrated that d53 was able to significantly increase fc- receptor dependent phagocytosis without modify the c3-receptor dependent activity. furthermore d53 enhanced the oxidative metabolism (evaluated by chemiluminescence) both using cells in resting conditions or after  stimulation with phagocytable or soluble stimuli. on the contrary d53 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of pmn migration toward different chemoattractants. using the two constitutive fractions of the compound (ribosomes and proteoglycans) we have observed that the mpg-kp component was mainly responsible  for the modulating activity of the drug on human pmns.

AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. antibacterial activities of sbtpc against clinically isolated strains of haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, and escherichia coli  were compared with those of ampicillin (abpc). sbtpc was superior to abpc especially against beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae, e. coli, s. aureus, and b. catarrhalis. 2. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (sbt) and abpc after administration of sbtpc fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. mean half-lives of sbt and abpc in  the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. mean urinary recovery rates of sbt and abpc in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. sbtpc  fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). the overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%.  4. no adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. no abnormal laboratory test values were observed. these results indicate the usefulness of sbtpc fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

AB  == the in vitro activities of several 14-, 15- and 16-membered macrolides were compared with that of erythromycin. in general, 14-membered macrolides such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, and flurithromycin were more active against streptococci and bordetella pertussis than was the 15-membered macrolide azithromycin, which was more active than 16-membered macrolides such as miocamycin and rokitamycin. clarithromycin was the most active compound against streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococci, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium  species. legionella pneumophila was most susceptible to miocamycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae,  and haemophilus influenzae were most susceptible to azithromycin. azithromycin and dirithromycin were the most active compounds against campylobacter jejuni. mics of 16-membered macrolides for strains expressing inducible-type resistance to erythromycin were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, whereas none of the compounds had activity against strains expressing constitutive-type resistance. the mics of roxithromycin, miocamycin, rokitamycin, and josamycin increased in the presence of human serum, whereas mics of the other compounds either were unchanged or decreased.

TI  == the role of haemophilus influenzae in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children.
AB  == the role of specific bacteria in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children in unknown. to determine the effect of specific bacteria on the presence and nature of tonsillar hypertrophy (measured both clinically and by tonsil weight), quantitative aerobic bacteriology was performed on 54 tonsil-core specimens from 54 children undergoing tonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis and/or tonsillar hypertrophy. twelve tonsil-core biopsies from 12 children with no history of tonsil disease served as controls. haemophilus influenzae (hi), streptococcus pyogenes (sp), streptococcus pneumoniae (spn), and staphylococcus aureus (sa) were the most common microorganisms cultured from diseased tonsils. few bacteria were cultured from the cores of controls. hi was cultured as the dominant aerobic bacteria in 15 of 54 tonsils (27%). for hi alone, the number of  bacteria/gram tonsil showed a significant positive correlation to tonsil weight (p less than 0.05). fourteen of 15 (94%) tonsils with hi were found in patients with clinical tonsillar hypertrophy, while only 6 of 10 patients (60%) with sp and spn had tonsillar hypertrophy. of the 38 tonsils removed for obstructive symptoms (clinical hypertrophy), 14 of 38 (37%) cultured hi as the dominant microorganisms, whereas only 6 of 38 (16%) cultured sp. neither the type of hi (b vs. non-b) nor the presence of beta-lactamase production had a significant correlation to tonsil weight, bacterial load or the number of b- or t-cell subsets. the number of t-helper (th), t-suppressor (ts) and b-cells (per gram/tonsil) was markedly greater in all diseased tonsils than in controls. for both hi and sp the total number of bacteria/gram tonsil correlated positively to  the number of ts cells (p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.007, respectively). in patients with hi type b (hi-b), the tonsil weight correlated to an increase in ts and b-cells (p less than 0.004 and p less than 0.007, respectively). an increased presence of the ts and b-cells in the hi-b tonsils (and not in tonsils  with hi non-b) suggests a differential response by the tonsil to these distinct but related bacteria. the above data strongly support an etiological role for hi  in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children. alterations in the relationship between th and ts cells may affect normal b-cell function and be implicated in this phenomenon. clinical implications for pathogenesis, antimicrobial therapy, and future directions for research are discussed.

AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == macroscopic purulence, leukocyte counts, and bacterial morphotypes in relation to culture findings for sinus secretions in acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == macroscopic purulence, leukocyte counts, and bacterial morphotypes in gram-stained smears were investigated in 335 sinus secretions (240 aspirates and  95 injection aspirates) obtained by puncture in 234 young patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. over 90% of the 147 aspirates macroscopically classified as  purulent also contained high numbers of leukocytes (greater than 20 per oil immersion field). a total of 82% of the 147 macroscopically purulent aspirates and 79% of the 156 aspirates containing high numbers of leukocytes yielded presumed sinus pathogens by culture in quantities of greater than 10(3) cfu/ml. streptococcus pneumoniae or streptococcus pyogenes was associated relatively more often (92 or 87%, respectively) with high numbers of leukocytes than haemophilus  influenzae, which was not infrequently (29%) recovered from the less purulent aspirates. when a bacterial morphotype was seen in the gram-stained smear, a corresponding sinus pathogen was isolated in quantities of greater than 10(3) cfu/ml in 92% of aspirates. other bacterial species (most often staphylococci) were usually isolated in low numbers and were almost never seen in the smear, suggesting nasal contamination. the 95 injection aspirates behaved, to a large extent, like diluted aspirates, with the exception that there was a higher frequency of probable nasal contamination. macroscopic purulence, high leukocyte  counts, and bacterial morphotypes seen in gram-stained smears each predicted well the isolation of a presumed sinus pathogen and in some cases supported the significance of an otherwise doubtful culture finding. however, the macroscopic appearance of the secretion should not be used to screen samples for culture, because in several cases h. influenzae grew from nonpurulent samples as well.

TI  == bacteriological findings of acute maxillary sinusitis in young adults.
AB  == bacteriological findings in 339 sinus secretions obtained by puncture were investigated in 238 young adult patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. aerobic  and anaerobic cultures were performed immediately. a total of 76% of the secretions were positive. the most common pathogens isolated were haemophilus influenzae (50%), streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), streptococcus pyogenes (5%), and branhamella catarrhalis (2%). coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus were isolated in 8 and 1% of the specimens, respectively. the staphylococci were almost invariably present in low numbers and, therefore, probably represented nasal contamination. other aerobic species were found only occasionally. anaerobes were isolated in 5% of the secretions. in one-half of these, a low concentration of propionibacterium acnes was the sole anaerobe that  was found, and it was usually mixed with a facultative organism (suggestive of contamination with nasal flora). only 2% of the sinuses were considered to have true anaerobic infections (high concentrations of several species typical of anaerobic infection), indicating that anaerobes are not a significant cause of acute maxillary sinusitis in a young adult population. the high recovery of h. influenzae in this study indicates that aminopenicillins may be more appropriate  choice than conventional penicillin in the antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis (only 2 of 168 h. influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase).

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates from upper respiratory tract infections].
AB  == sultamicillin (sbtpc) is a mutual prodrug in which ampicillin (abpc) and a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam (sbt) are ester-bound in an equimolar ratio. sbtpc is hydrolyzed during absorption after oral administration to provide abpc and sbt for systemic circulation. in the present study, the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against 50 isolates each of 6 species (staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes) of bacteria freshly obtained from upper respiratory tract infections were examined in relation to their bacterial beta-lactamase producing abilities. beta-lactamase producing strains were identified using the acidometry disc method with benzylpenicillin (pcg) of cefazolin (cez) as a substrate, and their frequencies of appearance were calculated as follows: s. aureus 86%; k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae 100%; b. catarrhalis 68%; h. influenzae 24%. fourteen per cent of s. aureus strains examined were beta-lactamase positive using both pcg and cez acidometry discs. sbtpc, however, demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activities even against these beta-lactamase producing strains. good activities were observed especially against those bacterial strains producing penicillinase (pcase). average mic80 values of sbtpc were 3.13 micrograms/ml for s. aureus and  k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, 0.39 micrograms/ml for b. catarrhalis and h. influenzae, 0.05 micrograms/ml for s. pneumoniae and 0.025 micrograms/ml for s. pyogenes. as sbtpc was shown to possess excellent antimicrobial activities against pcase producing strains, the enhancement in activities of sbtpc compared  to abpc alone can be attributed to the inhibition of beta-lactamase by sbt which, as noted above, is a component of sbtpc in an equimolar ratio to abpc.

TI  == many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence galnac beta 1-4gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  == pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the united states. to examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. the classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such  as streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-gm1 (fuc alpha 1-2gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4cer), asialo-gm1 (gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta-1-4galc beta 1-1cer), and asialo-gm2 (galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4glc beta 1-1cer). bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. they do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides gm1, gm2, gm3, gd1a, gd1b, gt1b, and cad. the finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked galnac, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-gm1 and asialo-gm1 and terminally in asialo-gm2, is required for binding. beta-n-acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence galnac beta 1-3gal. these data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal galnac beta 1-4gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. other bacteria,  including mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella species, and  some e. coli, do not bind to the galnac beta 1-4gal sequence. the biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-gm1 occur in human lung tissue.

TI  == [studies on susceptibility of isolated organisms from pediatric infections against various antimicrobial agents].
AB  == twelve oral antimicrobial agents were tested for their antimicrobial activities against causative organisms isolated from pediatric infections. activities of these antimicrobial agents against streptococcus pyogenes were also examined in relation to t-antigen typing of the species. the results of the investigation are summarized as follows. 1. against staphylococcus aureus, rokitamycin (rkm), josamycin, ofloxacin, minocycline exhibited strong antimicrobial activities, and  few strains of s. aureus showed resistance to these antimicrobial agents. more strains exhibited resistance to erythromycin (em) than to other macrolide antibiotics (mls) examined. amoxicillin (ampc)-resistance was often observed also. 2. against s. pyogenes, beta-lactam antibiotics (beta-lactams) and rkm had  mic80 of 0.20 microgram/ml or below, and no resistant strains of this organism were observed against these antibiotics. only 2 resistant strains (2.0%) of s. pyogenes to mls were detected, but resistance to tetracyclines (tcs) was observed at a high frequency, with 71.4% or more strains among t-4, t-6, t-12 and t-28 antigen types exhibited resistance to tcs. among the 21 strains of t-12 antigen type examined, only one strain (4.8%) was found resistant to mls. these observations suggested that the reduction in the frequency of ml-resistant strains was not due to the reduction in the number of t-12 antigen type strains but due to losses of resistance factors against mls of plasmids. 3. antibacterial activities of beta-lactams and mls against streptococcus pneumoniae strains were  good, similarly to activities against s. pyogenes. but many strains of s. pneumoniae were resistant to tcs. 4. new quinolone antimicrobial agents (quinolones) showed excellent activities against branhamella catarrhalis strains  with em and rkm showing the next best activities. the number of resistant strains against quinolones, however, seemed to be on an increase. 5. quinolones had strong antimicrobial activities against haemophilus influenzae, few strains of which showed resistance to quinolones. ampc had the next best activity, but approximately 10% of h. influenzae exhibited resistance to this antibiotic. 6. against campylobacter spp., quinolones and mls showed the best activities with mic80 values at or below 0.25 microgram/ml, and no resistant strains of the species against these antimicrobial agents were observed. fosfomycin and tcs showed somewhat inferior activities to quinolones and mls, with beta-lactams showing still lower activities. 7. only few strains of mycoplasma pneumoniae and  chlamydia trachomatis were examined, but mls and tcs appeared to be effective against these organisms.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [a clinical study of rokitamycin in pediatrics].
AB  == a total of 29 patients with pediatric infections was treated orally with 21.4-44.4 mg/kg/day of rokitamycin (rkm) dry syrup. the obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. clinical responses to rkm in 24 evaluable patients were excellent in 2 and good in 3 of 5 patients with tonsillitis and laryngitis; excellent in 3 and good in 5 of 8 patients with bronchitis; excellent in 3, good  in 2 and fair in one of 6 patients with bronchopneumonia; excellent in 2 and good in the other of 3 patients with psittacosis; and excellent in 2 of 2 patients with campylobacter colitis. the overall efficacy rate was 95.8%. 2. bacteriological responses to the drug were: reduction in 1 and no change in the other of 2 strains of streptococcus pyogenes; eradication of a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae and 2 strains of staphylococcus aureus; eradication of 2 and no change in 3 of 5 strains of haemophilus influenzae; and eradication of 2 out of 2 strains of campylobacter spp. 3. diarrhea was complained of as an adverse reaction to the rkm medication by 1 patient, abdominal pain was reported  by another, and anorexia by another of the 27 patients treated. laboratory examination was performed on some patients, but not abnormal test values were found except in 1 case showing an increase in platelet count from 27.6 to 78.2 x  10(4)/mm8. the results suggested that rkm dry syrup might be a very useful and safe drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.

TI  == [bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of a rokitamycin syrup in  pediatrics].
AB  == rokitamycin (rkm) dry syrup was administered to a group of pediatric patients. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. of the recent isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, fewer strains were highly resistant to rkm than to josamycin (jm), midecamycin (mdm), erythromycin and lincomycin. also, macrolides  (mls)-resistant strains proved to be susceptible to rkm. 2. recent isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, group g streptococci, s. pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to rkm than to midecamycin acetate and jm. oral administrations of 10-15 mg/kg of the drug were followed by its peak concentrations of 0.07-0.77 micrograms/ml in the blood at 30 minutes in many patients, and by an undetectable level at 6 hours also in many of them. t1/2 values were 1.2-2.6 hours, and first  6-hour urinary excretion rates were 1.26-1.74%. 3. fifty-two patients with acute  upper and lower respiratory tract infections, campylobacter enteritis, etc. were  treated with rkm at about 20-40 mg/kg daily for 4-14 days, with an overall efficacy rate of 88.5%. 4. an eradication rate of 81.4% was achieved for 43 strains of 7 species isolated from the patients. 5. no abnormal laboratory test values were observed after treatment with drug 4 approximately 14 days. a side effect, stomach discomfort, was observed in 1 patient.

TI  == [per rectal administration of antibiotics. clinical use of ampicillin in respiratory tract infection in children].
AB  == as one of our clinical studies on per rectal administration of antibiotics, children who suffered respiratory tract infection (rti) were administered with ampicillin (abpc) through this route. our conclusions drawn from this study are as follows: 1. one hundred and eighty strains of aerobic bacteria which were isolated by us in 1984-1985 were tested for the sensitivity to abpc using plate-disk method. mic's of abpc for all the strains of streptococcus pyogenes were lower than 0.024 micrograms/ml. mic's for all the strains of streptococcus haemolyticus were 0.05-0.20 microgram/ml. mic's for 88% of the strains tested of  haemophilus influenzae were 0.10-0.78 microgram/ml. 2. bacterial flora in the respiratory tract of 97 cases of children, who suffered rti, were cultured. almost half of them were gram-positive cocci, the rest belonged to gram-negative  groups. this indicates that broad-spectrum antibiotics should be chosen first even before the diagnosis of causative organisms is established. 3. soon after a  per rectal administration of abpc to children, high blood concentrations of the drug were observed by paper-disk method. 4. eleven cases, which included 2 cases  of pneumonia, of 15 children who suffered rti and were given this antibiotic were greatly improved within 3-10 days. no serious side effects were observed. 5. our  brief study reported here indicates that abpc administration by rectal route is safe and useful for the clinical treatment of rti of children.

TI  == prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma pneumoniae in children with and without pharyngitis.
AB  == the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and other treatable organisms was studied in children with and without pharyngitis. children aged 2 to 12 years were evaluated between november 1985 and april 1986 in three family practice offices in the salt lake city area. chlamydia trachomatis was not detected in the pharynx of any of the children studied. mycoplasma pneumoniae was cultured from 5 percent of the 242 children studied, group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus from 30 percent, non-group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus from 5 percent, hemophilus influenzae from 4 percent, and staphylococcus aureus from 14 percent. the symptoms reported  were not statistically associated with any organism isolated, and clinical signs  of pharyngitis were associated only with the presence of group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus. based on these results, management of pharyngitis in children should continue to be based on the detection and treatment of group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

TI  == induction of murine b cell proliferation and immunoglobulin synthesis by some bacterial ribosomes.
AB  == ribosomal preparations from klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae were investigated with respect to their activating capacity towards murine lymphoid cells. the proliferation of balb/c spleen cells was induced in a dose-dependent fashion (from 1 to 100 micrograms/ml) by ribosomes of k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and s. pyogenes with a peak activity at 48 or 72 hr of culture. the majority of the blast cells induced by these ribosomal preparations were positive for surface-immunoglobulin (s-ig) and negative for thy 1.2. furthermore, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and s. pyogenes ribosomes induced the synthesis of igm and some iga. cell proliferation and induction of igm production were also demonstrated with the 3 ribosomal preparations using spleen cells from athymic nude (nu+/nu+) mice, lyb-5-defective cba/n spleen cells, b cell-enriched and t cell-depleted balb/c spleen cell suspensions, as well as spleen cells from the ips gene-deficient c3h/hej strain. cell culture supernatants contained specific anti-ribosome igm antibodies. antibodies of other specificities (anti-sheep erythrocytes) were also demonstrated in supernatants from k. pneumoniae-stimulated cultures. evidence against a possible role of contamination of k. pneumoniae and h. influenzae ribosomes by lipopolysaccharide- or lipid a-associated proteins in this effect is discussed. ribosomes from s. pneumoniae did not induce 3h-thymidine incorporation nor ig production. none of the 4 ribosomal preparations was found to stimulate t cell blastogenesis or to induce interleukin-2 production by naive balb/c spleen cells. finally, ribosomes from h. influenzae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae but not those of k. pneumoniae stimulated  interleukin-1 production by adherent spleen cells, from balb/c mice.

TI  == bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

TI  == the immunology of tonsils in children: the effect of bacterial load on the presence of b- and t-cell subsets.
AB  == tonsil core specimens of 54 children, (3 to 12 years) with clinical evidence of chronic tonsillitis and/or "idiopathic" tonsillar hypertrophy, were studied for the effect of the magnitude of aerobic bacterial load on tonsil size and the absolute numbers of b- and t-cell subsets. tonsillar core specimens obtained from ten children with no history of ear, nose, or throat infections and normal appearing tonsils served as controls. the findings of this study indicate that tonsil size was directly proportional to the mean bacterial load in colony forming units/g tonsil (cfu/g) even in the absence of a clinical history of infection (p less than 0.01). a mean bacterial load of 2.4 +/- 2.1 x 10(5) cfu/g  tonsil was seen in diseased tonsils as compared to 1.6 +/- 2.4 x 10(4) cfu/g tonsil in normal controls (p less than 0.01). hemophilus influenzae (type b and non-b), staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were the most common pathogens recovered in the largest numbers from diseased tonsils; control tonsils harbored few bacteria in their cores. the absolute number of immunocompetent cells/g tonsil including t-helper, t-suppressor and b-cells (s-ig+), were significantly greater in diseased tonsils  than in controls (p less than 0.001). increasing microbial load (cfu/g tonsil) correlated with increased numbers of t-helper (p less than 0.01) and b-cells (p less than 0.01). these data strongly support a bacterial etiology for chronic tonsillitis as well as "idiopathic" tonsillar hypertrophy. bacterial induced proliferation of immunocompetent cells may be one underlying mechanism for chronic tonsillar disease in children.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and in vivo studies with azithromycin (cp-62,993), a new macrolide with an extended half-life and excellent tissue distribution.
AB  == azithromycin (cp-62,993), a new acid-stable 15-membered-ring macrolide, was well  absorbed following oral administration in mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. this compound exhibited a uniformly long elimination half-life and was distributed exceptionally well into all tissues. this extravascular penetration of azithromycin was demonstrated by tissue/plasma area-under-the-curve ratios ranging from 13.6 to 137 compared with ratios for erythromycin of 3.1 to 11.6. the significance of these pharmacokinetic advantages of azithromycin over erythromycin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models. azithromycin was orally effective in treating middle ear infections induced in gerbils by transbulla challenges with amoxicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae or susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; erythromycin failed and cefaclor was only marginally active against the h. influenzae challenge. azithromycin was equivalent to cefaclor and erythromycin against streptococcus pneumoniae. in mouse models, the new macrolide was 10-fold more potent than erythromycin and four other antibiotics against an anaerobic infection produced by fusobacterium necrophorum. similarly, azithromycin was effective against established tissue infections induced by salmonella enteritidis (liver and spleen) and staphylococcus aureus (thigh muscle); erythromycin failed against both infections. the oral and subcutaneous activities of azithromycin, erythromycin, and cefaclor were similar against acute systemic infections produced by streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, or s. aureus, whereas azithromycin was more potent than erythromycin and cefaclor against the intracellular pathogen listeria monocytogenes. the pharmacokinetic advantage of azithromycin over erythromycin in half-life was clearly demonstrated in prophylactic treatment of an acute mouse model of s. aureus infection. these properties of azithromycin strongly support the further evaluation of this new macrolide for use in community-acquired infections of skin or soft tissue and respiratory diseases.

TI  == concentrations of antibodies in paired maternal and infant sera: relationship to  igg subclass.
AB  == previous studies comparing igg subclass concentrations in cord and maternal sera  have indicated that igg1 is transported across the placenta to a greater extent than is igg2. the purpose of our study was to examine the relationship between the transport of igg1 and igg2 and the transport of specific antibodies that are  relatively restricted to a particular subclass, either igg1 or igg2. the concentrations of total serum igg1 and igg2 and those of igg-anti-tetanus toxoid  (tt) and anti-group a streptococcal carbohydrate (gac) were measured in 30 paired maternal and cord sera. previous studies have shown that anti-tt in adults is predominantly igg1, whereas anti-gac is predominantly igg2. the mean cord/maternal concentration ratios of igg1 and anti-tt were similar (1.77 +/- 0.56 and 1.93 +/- 0.67, respectively), but differed significantly (p = 0.0001) from those of igg2 and anti-gac (0.99 +/- 0.39 and 1.01 +/- 0.45, respectively).  we confirmed the difference in cord/maternal concentration ratios of igg1 and igg2 antibodies by measuring igg1 and igg2 antibodies specific for haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide; the mean cord/maternal concentration ratio of igg1-anti-hib ps was significantly higher than that of igg2-anti-hib ps  (2.23 +/- 0.83 compared with 0.94 +/- 0.49, p = 0.01). these results indicate that placental transport of igg antibodies is related to their subclass composition.

TI  == [the study of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  == flomoxef (fmox; 6315-s), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. the activity of fmox against staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and mic was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. this mic value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. the distribution of mic's of fmox against escherichia coli and salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. serum concentrations of fmox after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours  after administration, respectively, and t1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg fmox were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, t1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. fmox was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. in these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. all bacterial species identified including branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with fmox. 4. only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated got and gpt, and 1 case of elevated gpt were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.

TI  == comparative efficacies of erythromycin-sulfisoxazole and cefaclor in acute otitis media: a double blind randomized trial.
AB  == a prospective double blind trial compared the fixed combination of erythromycin-sulfisoxazole (e/s) with cefaclor in the treatment of acute otitis media. one hundred nineteen children in six centers across canada were studied. diagnostic tympanocentesis of 134 ears yielded 135 bacterial isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (42%); haemophilus influenzae (21%); branhamella catarrhalis (10%); streptococcus pyogenes (5%); and other bacteria (22%). seventy-seven percent of strains of b. catarrhalis and 14% of strains of h. influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. e/s exhibited greater in vitro activity against h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis. twenty-three patients had bacteriologically sterile middle ear fluid. the overall clinical outcome at days  10 and 31 was identical in both treatment groups. otoscopic findings improved more rapidly in the e/s group than in the cefaclor group at 10 and 31 days (p less than or equal to 0.04). in cases where pre-treatment middle ear fluid was negative on routine bacterial culture, complete cure at 10 days was observed in 75% of patients treated with e/s but only in 14% of those treated with cefaclor (p = 0.02). side effects were infrequent and comparable between the test drugs. e/s is at least as effective as cefaclor in the management of acute otitis media  and may be superior, particularly for cases not yielding bacteria on routine culture.

TI  == [bacteriological study of acute otitis media in children. therapeutic consequences].
AB  == one hundred children presenting with acute otitis media underwent a bacteriological study of otitis exudate over a 18 month period. the bacteria found were as follows: streptococcus pneumoniae (24), haemophilus influenzae (19), staphylococcus aureus (12), streptococcus pyogenes (7), branhamella catarrhalis (3), and 18 gram negative bacilli (including 7 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 11 enterobacteriaceae). one pathogenic bacterium was isolated in 56 cases, 2  or more in 12 cases and none in 32 cases. in the age categories 0-1 year (47 cases) and 1-3 years (31 cases), s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae were the main organisms found, followed by s. pyogenes in children older than 3 years (22 cases). with respect to the antibiotics used for treating otitis, 5/22 s. pneumoniae and 4/17 h. influenzae were erythromycin resistant (9/17 had an intermediate susceptibility) and 7/19 h. influenzae and 1/17 s. pneumoniae were cotrimoxazole resistant. none of the s. pneumoniae and 2/19 h. influenzae were ampicillin resistant. these 2 h. influenzae and 2/3 b. catarrhalis were beta-lactamase producers. they were sensitive to the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid.

AB  == fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates  within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2,  acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == relapse of acute purulent otitis media: antibiotic sensitivities of nasopharyngeal pathogens.
AB  == the present investigation was conducted to find out if a relapse of acute purulent otitis media is associated with a decreased sensitivity of nasopharyngeal pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents. all but one of 63 children with relapse included in this study yielded one or more of the classical middle ear pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, s. pyogenes) in their nasopharynx (nph) secretions. s. pneumoniae was the predominating isolate from nph (71% of the patients) as well as from middle ear effusion (53%). at a control visit 4 weeks after the start of  antibiotic therapy, 91% were nph carriers of potential pathogens and s. pneumoniae was still the most common isolate (53%). beta-lactamase was produced by 55% of b. catarrhalis isolates from the nph specimens on the first visit, but  only by 33% of b. catarrhalis isolates on the control visit. two nph isolates of  h. influenzae produced beta-lactamase. one isolate of s. pneumoniae (serotype 18) was intermediately sensitive to phenoxymethylpenicillin. generally low mics were  found for erythromycin and cefaclor. h. influenzae isolates were generally sensitive to ampicillin in vitro, but only 1 isolate was fully sensitive to erythromycin. b. catarrhalis isolates were uniformly sensitive to doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. no tolerance to penicillin was demonstrated in s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae. the present data indicate that the relapse of acute otitis media is not associated with development of tolerance or resistance to therapeutic antimicrobials commonly used.

TI  == pyogenic arthritis in infants and children: a review of 95 cases.
AB  == the clinical and laboratory findings of 95 children with pyogenic arthritis were  reviewed to assess etiologic agents, diagnostic tools and results of therapy. despite obtaining specimens from multiple sites for culture and using antigen detection tests only 64% of patients had an etiologic agent determined. haemophilus influenzae type b was the most common causative agent identified and  82% of such cases occurred in children between 6 and 24 months of age. infection  due to staphylococcus aureus was not confined to any age group. results of laboratory tests which measure inflammatory response were not always abnormal. platelet count and sedimentation rate frequently rose as clinical improvement occurred. roentgenograms and radionuclide studies were of little benefit. therapy included immediate decompression of the joint space, articular rest and use of antibiotics delivered parenterally. ninety percent of 70 patients who were followed for 1 month to 5 years (mean, 15.5 months) were cured. eight children had clinically significant sequelae which affected length of extremity, stability of articulations and range of movement. development of sequelae was significantly associated with infection at age less than 6 months, delay of 4 or more days in institution of medical or surgery treatment, infection due to s. aureus and most  strikingly the involvement of the hip or shoulder with concomitant presence of osteomyelitis.

TI  == pattern of retropharyngeal abscess in nigerian children.
AB  == a study of cases of retropharyngeal abscess in nigerian children was carried out. it occurred most commonly in children under the age of 6 months and in more male  children than female in a ratio of 5:3.most children seen at the lagos university teaching hospital were brought in late with the upper airway already obstructed.  a diagnostic tool of soft-tissue x-ray examination of the neck is not foolproof.  in fact, 22.58 percent of soft-tissue x-ray examinations of the neck in this study produced false-positive results. factors contributing to these results are  discussed.bacteriology showed the main organisms to be hemophilus influenzae (45.84 percent) and streptococcus pyogenes (33.33 percent). all cases were found  to be secondary to upper respiratory tract infection.

TI  == current state and tendencies of antibiotic resistance in hungary.
AB  == this survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by public health network laboratories in 1983. facultatively pathogenic gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. in contrast to other streptococci, all streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. the majority of the gram-positive  strains were resistant to tetracycline. a comparison to results reported earlier  (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. emergence of haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of p. mirabilis and streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. the increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. in some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. a restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. multiresistant gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a  representative clinical material. the frequent occurrence of multiresistant p. mirabilis and acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant e. coli strains was very low. amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.

TI  == ofloxacin in oral chemotherapy of acute and chronic otitis media.
AB  == after ascertaining the bacterial spectrum in 210 patients with otitis media acuta, otitis media chronica mesotympanalis and otitis media chronica epitympanalis, the clinical efficacy of oral therapy with ofloxacin in 40 patients from each of these groups was assessed. the clinical results are comparable with those following conventional local, oral and intravenous antibiotic therapy. the microbiological analysis of the ear secretions revealed staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae to be the main infectious agents of acute otitis media, whereas in chronic otitis media pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus sp. could be detected in most of the cases. ofloxacin levels of ear secretions, mucosa specimens of the middle ear and serum  were measured in some patients by means of hplc. in most cases, drug levels exceeded the mics for the bacteria mentioned above. the correlation with the clinical results is discussed. on the basis of these preliminary results, ofloxacin can be considered as a highly efficient oral substance which is effective against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, two important pathogens of middle  ear infections.

AB  == of 155 highlands children with purulent culture-positive meningitis studied from  march 1980 to september 1984, 84% were aged twelve months or less and 92% were infected with either haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae or both organisms. other pathogens were neisseria meningitidis (8 isolations), streptococcus pyogenes (2 isolations) and streptococcus agalactiae and klebsiella species (1 of each). among h. influenzae isolates, serotype b strains predominated (83%) and most (96%) belonged to biotype i or ii. infections due to  non-b haemophili included serotype a (9 strains), serotype f (1 strain) and non-serotypable variants (3 strains). of 67 s. pneumoniae strains 22% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.1-1.0  micrograms/ml. the commonest serotypes were types 5 (11 isolates), type 7 (9 isolates) and types 2, 6 and 46 (6 of each). no resistance to chloramphenicol was detected in either h. influenzae or s. pneumoniae and only one of 56 strains of h. influenzae was insensitive to betalactam antibiotics. the known case fatality  rate in this study was 37%. more children with pneumococcal infection died (46%)  than those with haemophilus infection (30%), though the difference was not statistically significant; 79% of all deaths occurred in children aged less than  twelve months. there is an urgent need for h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae vaccines that are effective in young children.

TI  == critical appraisal of the clinical relevance of rapid diagnosis in pediatrics.
AB  == to assess the potential impact of rapid diagnostic tests on the care of the pediatric patient a critical evaluation of the antigen detection tests currently  available for two important pediatric diseases--haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis--is presented. antigen detection tests for haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis are of value primarily as an adjunct to traditional procedures, whereas antigen detection tests for the rapid diagnosis of group a beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis could, in the near future, replace the blood agar culture. this comparison demonstrates that the evaluation of a new diagnostic test should include not only a determination of its accuracy, but, in addition, a determination of its advantages over current methods, the frequency with which the test will be performed, the consequences of a false-negative or false-positive test result, and the potential impact on patient care resulting from use of the test.

TI  == imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of infections in hospitalized children.
AB  == imipenem is the first of a new class of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with potent in vitro activity against most bacterial pathogens that cause infections in children. we studied, prospectively, the clinical efficacy and toxicity of imipenem/cilastatin in 40 children with proved or suspected bacterial infection.  a dose of 100 mg/kg/day of imipenem was given to children younger than 3 years of age, while children older than 3 years of age received 60 mg/kg/day. twenty-nine  organisms were isolated from 26 patients. infections treated included cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, lymphadenitis, renal infections, wound infections, and pneumonia. bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all patients responded favorably to treatment, with defervescence and improvement of  symptoms. all of the infecting bacteria were susceptible to imipenem. imipenem/cilastatin was well tolerated, with no serious side effects, and appeared to be an effective and safe antimicrobial agent in the treatment of the  population studied.

TI  == are the tonsils and adenoids a reservoir of infection in otitis media with effusion (glue ear)?
AB  == in a prospective investigation of the treatment of glue ear in children, the possible role of persistent infection in the tonsils and adenoids was assessed by comparing bacterial cultures of swabs and resected tissue from the tonsils and adenoids of patients with cultures of swabs from similar sites in control subjects without ent abnormality. for almost all potential pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, no statistically significant differences were demonstrated between patients and controls. the same was true of streptococcus pyogenes in tonsil specimens, while in adenoid specimens rather more isolates were obtained in patients than controls. this difference was just statistically significant at the 5% level, but only when all isolations, including very scanty growths, were compared. on present evidence, persistent infection should not be invoked to explain the success of adenoidectomy in otitis media with effusion or to justify adenotonsillectomy.

TI  == etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in patients requiring hospitalization.
AB  == the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was studied in 127 patients with roentgenologically verified pneumonia who needed hospitalization. etiology was determined on the basis of a positive blood culture and/or a significant antibody titer increase. streptococcus pneumoniae was the probable etiological agent in 69 patients, nontypeable haemophilus influenzae in five patients, streptococcus pyogenes in two patients, and legionella pneumophila and staphylococcus aureus in one patient each. evidence of mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was found in 18 patients and of chlamydia psittaci infection in three patients. influenza virus type a was the cause of infection in 15 patients. one patient had infection with  influenza virus type b, one patient with parainfluenza virus type 1, and three patients with respiratory syncytial virus. in 20 patients there was evidence of infection with more than one microorganism. no etiological agent was found in 27  patients. since streptococcus pneumoniae was the predominant etiological agent penicillin should be drug of first choice in patients with pneumonia who need treatment in hospital. in young adults, however, the high frequency of mycoplasma pneumoniae infection would justify the use of erythromycin or doxycycline as drug of first choice.

TI  == deposition of c3b and ic3b onto particulate activators of the human complement system. quantitation with monoclonal antibodies to human c3.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies were used to determine the number and molecular form of c3  bound to particulate activators of the complement (c) system by human serum. sheep erythrocytes (e) coated with igm (eigm) and igg (eigg) were used to study activation of the classical pathway (cp). yeast (y), rabbit erythrocytes (er), and five species of bacteria (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, streptococcus pyogenes, and hemophilus influenzae type b) were used to study activation of the alternative pathway (ap). the deposition of c3b onto eigm and eigg incubated in c7-deficient human serum was dependent on the serum concentration. at all serum concentrations tested, there was complete conversion of c3b to ic3b. kinetic analysis of c3b deposition  and conversion to ic3b indicated that these events occurred almost simultaneously; the reaction was completed by 15 min. the deposition of c3 onto the ap activators er and y was also dependent on serum concentration, and er, but not y, required the presence of mg-egta and thus the activation of only the ap. c3b deposition and conversion to ic3b on y was complete in 15 min, with 82% of bound c3 converted to ic3b. for er, maximum c3 deposition required 30 min in both the presence and absence of mg-egta. however, after 1 h of incubation, 74% of bound c2 was ic3b in the absence of mg-egta, compared with only 52% in the presence of mg-egta. thus, even on ap activators, a large portion of c3b may be converted to ic3b, and this conversion is probably controlled by elements on the  particle's surface. studies with the five species of bacteria yielded similar results. approximately 3-5 x 10(4) molecules of c3 were bound per microorganism,  with opsonization being completed in 30 min. remarkably, only 16-28% of bound c3  was in the form of ic3b, even after 2 h of incubation. the presence or absence of mg-egta, or the addition of purified cr1 to the reaction mixture, did not significantly effect the ratio of c3b to ic3b. finally, sds-page and autoradiography of particle-bound 125i-c3 fragments confirmed that there was no conversion of ic3b to c3d,g or c3d. the data obtained about the opsonization of bacteria suggest that the predominant form of c3 that is encountered by inflammatory phagocytes may be c3b.

TI  == clinical value of paired sputum and transtracheal aspirates in the initial management of pneumonia.
AB  == one hundred young adults with acute pneumonia were prospectively studied to determine the impact of the transtracheal aspiration (tta) gram stain on immediate management. sputum and tta interpretations by staff and housestaff were compared. after a management plan was elected based on sputum gram stain interpretation, the tta was evaluated and the final plan chosen. a change in treatment after the tta was available occurred in eight cases, and this was an appropriate change in only five. the putative pathogen as identified by tta culture was correctly predicted after sputum gram stain interpretation in 36 to 62 percent of cases and after tta interpretation in 37 to 62 percent. this indicates significant observer variation but not superiority of one type of specimen over the other. in most cases, paired sputum and tta gram stain were both read correctly or incorrectly. when differences occurred, sputum interpretations were as likely to be correct as were tta interpretations. the tta gram stain offered no advantage over sputum gram stain in the initial management  of acute pneumonia in this young adult military population.

TI  == bordetella adenylate cyclase: host toxicity and diagnostic utility.
AB  == two toxins from bordetella pertussis, pertussis toxin and bordetella adenylate cyclase, cause profound disruptions of camp metabolism in mammalian cells. while  the role of each toxin in the whooping cough syndrome is unknown, it is highly likely that together they confer on the organism an important proliferative advantage. intact b. pertussis cells express large amounts of adenylate cyclase activity on their exterior surface. in a presently unknown fashion, this enzyme can enter human phagocytes, elevate cellular camp and impair host defense. we reasoned that this unusual enzyme might serve to signal the presence of b. pertussis in nasopharyngeal swabs from infected persons. here we report a series  of in vitro experiments which confirm the feasibility of such an approach. we find that calcium alginate swabs containing as few as 100 b. pertussis organisms  produce readily detectable amounts of camp in our assay. nasopharyngeal secretions swabbed from healthy volunteers, however produced no detectable camp alone and did not affect the production of camp by b. pertussis. we have also tested pure cultures of four common bacterial pathogens (haemophilus influenzae,  streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli) which may be co-isolated in clinical whooping cough and find that none interferes with the detection of b. pertussis. we conclude that the unique adenylate cyclase of b. pertussis might be a valuable diagnostic device.

TI  == bacteriology and treatment of purulent nasopharyngitis: a double blind, placebo-controlled evaluation.
AB  == one hundred forty-two children with purulent nasopharyngitis were randomized to four treatment groups with an antibiotic (cephalexin) alone or combined with a decongestant/antihistamine (pseudoephedrine/triprolidine) or their corresponding  placebo equivalents. follow-up evaluations by parents and physicians and bacteriologic evaluations were performed after 5 to 6 days of therapy. groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, race, number of patients withdrawn from  the study, fever greater than 38.0 degrees c, appearance of nasal discharge, nasal crusting and number of days until follow-up. initial cultures from patients grew: streptococcus pneumoniae, 46%; haemophilus influenzae type b, 21%; and streptococcus pyogenes, 8%. nasal crusting was significantly associated with the  growth of s. pneumoniae or h. influenzae type b. there were no significant differences between active drug and placebo treatment groups for change in nasal  discharge, complications or apparent drug benefit. cephalexin therapy did not result in a decrease in cultivation of pathogenic organisms from the nasopharynx. significantly more side effects were attributed to pseudoephedrine/triprolidine treatment than to placebo. routine culture or treatment of purulent nasopharyngitis should not be considered unless future controlled clinical trials demonstrate some therapeutic benefit.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. observation on the mics and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm =  mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the  following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3  to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.

AB  == four adult patients had life-threatening soft-tissue infections of the neck. one  had hemophilus influenzae infection, one had streptococcus pyogenes infection, and two had polymicrobial mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections. three of the four patients died despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy and surgical intervention. these cases demonstrate the spectrum of serious soft-tissue infections of the neck in both the compromised and the uncompromised host. soft-tissue infections of the neck may be necrotizing or nonnecrotizing. cellulitis secondary to h. influenzae and beta-hemolytic streptococci is usually  non-necrotizing, whereas necrotizing infections are caused most commonly by synergistic organisms. potential complications include septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, mediastinitis, and pericarditis. early recognition with aggressive medical and surgical therapy is essential to reduce the mortality.

TI  == acute epiglottitis in adults.
AB  == we treated four adults whose upper airway was compromised due to acute epiglottitis. we also reviewed the english literature for all reports of this condition in adults (18 years and older). among the 158 cases, the infectious etiology was identified in 29 (h. influenzae 20, streptococcus pneumoniae six, h. parainfluenzae two, streptococcus pyogenes one). in the remaining cases, the etiology was uncertain. bacteremia was documented in 23/32 patients (71.9%), but  extra-epiglottic infections were strikingly rare (x = six). the clinical manifestations were sore throat (100%), fever (88%), dyspnea (78%), dysphagia (76%), anterior neck cellulitis or tenderness (27%), hoarseness (21%), pharyngitis (20%) and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (9%). complete airway obstruction ensued in 23 out of the 119 subjects (18.3%) who had respiratory difficulty. overall mortality rate was 17.6% but it was 6.4% among the patients who were semi-electively tracheostomized or endotracheally intubated. these findings illustrate that antibiotics therapy active against h. influenzae is required in the treatment of acute epiglottitis in adults. additionally, airway patency should be established when inspiratory stridor appears assuring uncomplicated recovery.

TI  == bacterial sinusitis.
AB  == sinusitis may occur secondary to infectious agents, allergens, or pollutants. bacteriologic studies carried out from sinus punctures revealed that streptococcus pneumoniae and hemophilus influenzae are the most common bacterial  pathogens isolated. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are not uncommon pathogens. complications of sinusitis, including orbital cellulitis, usually are due to infection with staphylococcus aureus and h influenzae. the recent increase in certain areas of the country of beta-lactamase-producing strains of h influenzae is noted. when the etiology remains to be determined in the patient with acute bacterial sinusitis, initial therapy with an oral cephalosporin seems warranted.

TI  == antibiotic treatment of secretory otitis media.
AB  == there is increasing evidence for an infectious etiology of secretory otitis media (som). respiratory pathogens (s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, b. catarrhalis and group a streptococci) have been found in cases of long-standing som, with a frequency of 18% in the middle ear and 79% in the nasopharynx. erythromycin has been shown to penetrate into the middle ear effusion of som and into adenoid tissue. the concentrations surpassed the mic's of most respiratory pathogens, with the exception of certain strains of h. influenzae. in agreement with this, a ten day course of erythromycin in children with som eradicated practically all nasopharyngeal strains of s. pneumoniae and b. catarrhalis, while there was no significant decrease in the number of strains of h. influenzae. the present study consisted of 119 children with som lasting three months or more. one group of 47  consecutive children was treated with erythromycin (abboticin), given orally twice a day, in a dose of 40-60 mg/kg/24 hours, for ten days. the rate of resolution in this test group was 45% (21/47 cases). another group of 72 consecutive children with som of a similar duration received no antibiotics. the  cure rate in this control group was 15% (11/72 cases). the difference between the two groups is statistically significant (chi 2 = 11054; df = 1; p less than 0.001). the results suggest that a ten day course of erythromycin could reduce the need for surgical treatment in children with long-standing som.

AB  == the new aminothiazoyl-cephalosporin, ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), was found to have  excellent inhibitory activity against the enterobacteriaceae (minimum inhibitory  concentration needed to inhibit 50% of isolates (mic50) less than or equal to 0.004-0.5 microgram/ml, haemophilus influenzae (mic50 less than or equal to 0.004 micrograms/ml), neisseria species (mic50 less than or equal to 0.001 microgram/ml), pneumococci (mic50 0.25 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic50 2.0 micrograms/ml), and streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 0.015 micrograms/ml). ceftriaxone was less effective against acinetobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other pseudomonas species (mic50 8.0-16 micrograms/ml). methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci were not significantly inhibited by ceftriaxone. ceftriaxone was very resistant to beta-lactamase hydrolysis, although the type iv cephalosporinase minimally destroyed the compound at 16.4-19.9% of the rates for cephaloridine. type i cephalosporinases were inhibited by ceftriaxone and related enzyme-stable cephalosporins. based on analysis of disk-mic regression statistics, tentative recommendations for the disk test of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards are 21 mm or more = susceptible, 14-20 mm = moderately susceptible, and 13 mm or less = resistant. these criteria produce interpretive accuracy of more than 92%, with very rare major errors. ceftriaxone was comparable to cefotaxime in spectrum and activity, thus allowing the use of the "spectrum-class" concept (for example, cefotaxime tests in vitro to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility, and vice versa).

TI  == potential significance of colonization with beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus  parainfluenzae in children.
AB  == recent surveys in vancouver showed most healthy children were colonized with beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae. such organisms might alter the effects of penicillins on throat bacteria by local inactivation. to test this hypothesis in vitro, three isolates of beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae were each mixed on a membrane with ampicillin-sensitive strains of haemophilus influenzae type b or group a streptococcus pyogenes and exposed to ampicillin. when tested alone, susceptible strains were rapidly killed but when tested together with a beta-lactamase producer, they were protected, indicating efficient ampicillin degradation by haemophilus parainfluenzae strains. if similar interactions occur in vivo, the effects of beta-lactams on throat bacteria could be significantly altered in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae.

AB  == bacteriologic investigations were performed on 100 children with acute otitis media by culturing the fluid from a myringotomy site. patients ranged in age from 7 months to 14 years, and 91 were younger than 6 years old. bacterial isolates were yielded from cultures in 83 cases, and mixtures of two or three organisms were obtained from 15 patients. among the total of 100 isolates, the most predominant organism was streptococcus pneumoniae (28), followed by hemophilus influenzae (26), staphylococcus aureus (19), and streptococcus pyogenes (six). minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin sodium against s pneumoniae and h influenzae were 0.016 to 0.032 and 0.25 to 0.5 mg/l, respectively. none of the strains of h influenzae were resistant to ampicillin. the mics of dicloxacillin sodium, cephalexin monohydrate, cefaclor, and erythromycin to h influenzae were 8 to 32, 8 to 16, 2 to 8, and 2 to 8 mg/l, respectively. the preferred drug for acute otitis media would be ampicillin in japan, but we have to consider antistaphylococcal antibiotics for the patients who do not respond to 48 hours of treatment.

TI  == [the antibacterial activity of new cephem antibiotics against clinical isolates.  a comparison of the antibacterial activity of cefotaxime with 6 other antibiotics].
AB  == during the period from may through july 1981, a comparative study was carried out on the antibacterial activities of cefotaxime (ctx) and ceftizoxime (czx), cefoperazone (cpz), latamoxef (lmox), cefotiam (ctm), cefmetazole (cmz) and cefazolin (cez). ctx and these other cephem antibiotics were tested against fresh clinical isolates which had been obtained from clinical materials by the laboratories of 14 participating medical institutions. 1. the clinical isolates were obtained from various clinical materials in the following decreasing order:  urine, sputum and pus/discharge; 85.7% of the isolates came from these materials. 2. concerning the sources of each species of clinical isolates, it was found that p. aeruginosa was isolated from the greatest number -9- of different clinical materials. this was followed by e. coli and e. cloacae, each isolated from 8 different clinical materials, and c. freundii and e. aerogenes, each found in 7 different clinical materials. 3. in relation to s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, ctx showed the best antibacterial activity; the second most potent antibiotic was czx. cmz and lmox were found to show relatively high mic values for those species. against s. aureus, cez showed the best antibacterial activity, but 3 resistant strains had mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 4. with regard to gram-negative bacteria, ctx and czx showed the best antibacterial activities for all of the species, except for p. aeruginosa. these were followed, in order, by lmox and cpz. compared with these 4 antibiotics, ctm, cmz and cez were found to have inferior antibacterial activities against these bacteria. in relation to p. aeruginosa, the peak of the mic distribution for cpz was 6.25 micrograms/ml, and this was the best antibacterial activity detected with the various antibiotics tested. this was followed by ctx (25 micrograms/ml) lmox (25  micrograms/ml) and czx (50 micrograms/ml). ctm had an mic of 100 micrograms/ml for 1 strain, and mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml for all of the other strains of p. aeruginosa, indicating them to be resistant to this antibiotic. all of the strains were resistant to cmz and cez, showing mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 5. for each of the tested antibiotics, no correlation was found between the mic and the serogroup for either p. aeruginosa or s. marcescens.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a recently developed cephamycin, was investigated under various experimental conditions. the compound showed moderate  activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis, but a high activity against enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. haemophilus influenzae also was fairly susceptible. the mbc was usually equal to  or two- or fourfold higher than mic. medium composition, ph and inoculum size had minimal influence on its activity. about 50% of recent clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to cefotetan, but some were highly resistant. killing curves of cefotetan against different bacterial strains indicated that it was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations equal to mic or two- to fourfold higher. however, some strains showed regrowth after initial inhibition. combination of cefotetan with aminoglycosides, or with cefazolin, cefotaxime, moxalactam or piperacillin resulted either in synergy, addition or indifference according to the bacterial strain and the nature of the combination. antagonism was never observed. human serum protein binding varied from 75 to 86%  according to the assay method. binding with horse serum protein was about 28%.

TI  == antibiotic sensitivity of haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and branhamella catarrhalis isolated from upper respiratory tract infections in sweden.
AB  == isolates of haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and branhamella catarrhalis were collected from five laboratories in different geographical areas in sweden. nine hundred and fortyfour strains were tested by the agar dilution method for susceptibility to seven oral antibiotics:  phenoximethylpenicillin, ampicillin, cefaclor, erythromycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. the h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis strains were also tested for beta-lactamase production. of the h. influenzae strains, 8% were beta-lactamase-producing, while 35% of b. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. the latter value is higher than has earlier been reported in sweden. five s. pneumoniae strains showed decreased sensitivity to penicillin, and 9.5% of the s. pneumoniae strains showed a decreased sensitivity  to one or more of the seven antibiotics tested. the s. pyogenes strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested with the exception of 4% of the strains,  which showed a decreased sensitivity to doxycycline.

TI  == serum and saliva concentrations of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in adults and children: relation between saliva concentrations and in vitro activity against nasopharyngeal pathogens.
AB  == the combination sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) was given orally to 4 healthy adult volunteers in mean daily doses of 23.0/4.6 mg/kg body weight for 6  days. the serum and saliva concentrations of the drugs were assayed on days 1, 3  and 6. on the first day (0-12 h) there was no measurable concentration of smx in  the saliva. on days 3 and 6 the mean peak levels of smx in saliva were 7.8 and 9.8 micrograms/ml, i.e. 8-9% of the corresponding mean peak serum levels. in contrast, the concentrations of tmp in saliva were more than twice as high as those in serum. the mean smx/tmp ratios in saliva days 3 and 6 were 1.3 and 1.4,  respectively, i.e. approximately one-twentieth of the mean smx/tmp ratios in serum. smx/tmp was also administered to children with serous otitis media. the drug concentrations in saliva were assayed 2-3 h after administration on days 6 and 9 of a 10-day course, with a mean daily dose of 34.5/6.9 mg/kg body weight. the mean saliva concentration of smx in the children was slightly higher than in  adults and the mean tmp concentration about half of that in adults. the mean smx/tmp ratio in the children's saliva was 4.2. the in vitro activity of smx/tmp  20:1 and 4:1 was determined against h. influenzae, d. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis  and group a streptococci. h. influenzae, d. pneumoniae and group a streptococci were found more susceptible to tmp than to smx, while the reverse was true for b. catarrhalis. in the 3 former, the potentiation of smx by tmp was more pronounced  than was the potentiation of tmp by smx, while the opposite was recorded for b. catarrhalis. the most beneficial effect of the smx/tmp combination against nasopharyngeal pathogens was recorded for b. catarrhalis and the weakest effect for h. influenzae and group a streptococci. with the exception of b. catarrhalis, the administration of tmp alone to adults may be just as effective against nasopharyngeal pathogens as is the smx/tmp combination in children.

TI  == a controlled trial of cefaclor versus amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media in early infancy.
AB  == optimal antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy is controversial. we studied the efficacy of cefaclor and amoxicillin in  the treatment of 40 nonconsecutive infants less than 3 months of age in a double  blind comparative trial. infants were randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin or cefaclor in a dosage of 40 mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses for 10 days. clinical responses and adverse drug effects were evaluated at 48 to 72 hours, 5 to 7 days, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. pathogenic bacteria isolated from ear aspirates in 24 cases included streptococcus pneumoniae (14), haemophilus influenzae type b (5), h. influenzae nontypeable (3), staphylococcus aureus (4),  branhamella sp. (2), and streptococcus pyogenes (1). nonpathogenic bacteria isolated in 14 cases included streptococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids and streptococcus viridans. two aspirates were sterile. a satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 15 of 21 cases (71%) treated with amoxicillin and 14 of  19 cases (74%) treated with cefaclor. we conclude that amoxicillin and cefaclor are comparable in efficacy for the therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy.

TI  == clinical trials of cefotaxime for the treatment of bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  == the efficacy of cefotaxime sodium for treatment of patients with lower respiratory infections was evaluated by three protocols in multicenter trials. the first trial studied cefotaxime alone; the second and third trials compared cefotaxime with cefazolin in observer-blind and single-blind randomized controlled studies, respectively. a total of 656 patients were entered in the three trials; 527 received cefotaxime. overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure, analyzed by pathogen, for the cefotaxime treated patients were 89.9% and 93.9%, respectively. in the two comparative trials, overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure with cefotaxime, by pathogen, were greater than 94% and numerically exceeded those for cefazolin in each instance. the efficacies in the comparative studies, when analyzed by total patient responses, were significantly different only for clinical responses to cefotaxime in the single-blind randomized trial (p = 0.03). favorable cure rates with cefotaxime were obtained in patients with infections due to streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli, and nearly comparable responses were obtained for infections due to proteus, enterobacter, and klebsiella species. cefotaxime was clinically effective in some of the infections due to serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but bacteriologic failures occurred in 67% and 61% of cases, respectively. all serratia strains were highly susceptible in vitro to cefotaxime, but the range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime for  pseudomonas isolates was wide.

AB  == a new method is described for the detection of bacterial immunoglobulin a (iga) protease which splits iga into fab and fc fragments. the method takes advantage of a recent finding that receptors for iga fragments occur commonly among type 4  group a streptococci. the bacterial preparation to be tested for protease activity was first incubated with radiolabeled purified iga1 myeloma protein, and the proportion of radioactivity bound to a standard suspension of the streptococci was then measured. since isolated fab fragments do not bind to streptococcal iga receptors, a decrease in the amount of radioactivity bound to the streptococci, as compared with the amount before digestion, indicates the presence of protease in the test preparation. using this method, protease activity was detected in neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus sanguis, but  not in escherichia coli or branhamella catarrhalis.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  == studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. mic of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of staphylococcus  aureus (36 strains), escherichia coli (35 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). mic of cefoxitin against s. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. many strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae that showed high mic to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. it is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. mic of cefoxitin against h. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. the serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. the mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. the mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours  after the injection. 3. in order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. as for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. as for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of h. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-streptococcus, enterococcus, e. coli and neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. no side effect was observed in any case. abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each  of reduction of rbc and hb, elevation of got and gpt and elevation of gpt, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of s. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less  than 0.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less  active than cefoperazone against pseudomonas aeruginosa. presence of serum, alteration of ph, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels.  bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some enterobacter, proteus, and bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365).
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime  required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)) ranged from 0.06 to  8 mug/ml for the enterobacteriaceae. the mic(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for s. aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. cefmenoxime was very active against haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis with mic(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited  78% and 73% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., respectively. mics  for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. in addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. the combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the enterobacteriaceae  and 100% of p. aeruginosa strains tested. development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial mics but more rapid for those with higher initial mics. cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or s. aureus but was less effective against p. aeruginosa.

AB  == cefadroxil (duricef, mead johnson and company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates  under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. in this kinetic model, cefadroxil  was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of escherichia coli. the other strain of e. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. s. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.

TI  == comparative study of erythromycin, amoxicillin and ampicillin antimicrobial activity against human respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == an in vitro test system was used to compare the antimicrobial activity of erythromycin, amoxicillin and ampicillin against respiratory tract pathogens isolated from man. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of fresh clinical isolates of streptoccus pyogenes, streptocuccus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae to the macrolide and penicillins ranged between 0.01 and 0.9 microgram/ml. the microbes were exposed to each antibiotic for approximately 3 h at 1x,2x and 5x the relevant mic. irreversible surface defects  and intracellular lesions were resolved by scanning and transmission electron microscopy in all antibiotic-treated bacterial species, irrespective of the antimicrobial used. in each case, inhibition of growth was recorded by turbometric assay; no significant difference was observed among the declining slopes of post-dosing growth curves for either erythromycin-, amoxicillin- or ampicillin-treated pathogens. the experimental observations show that the onset of antimicrobial activity and the bactericidal effectiveness of equipotent concentrations of erythromycin, amoxicillin and ampicillin were comparable in this study. the results complement previous clinical, bacteriologic and ultrastructure studies in vivo and demonstrate the contribution of the combined in vivo/in vitro study design for better understanding of antimicrobial activity  in human respiratory tract infections.

TI  == aetiologic agents of septic sore throat in thai children.
AB  == a bacteriological study of children with respiratory infections in bangkok during january to november 1976 revealed that 37% of the patients had symptoms and sign  of bacterial pharyngotonsillitis. twenty-six per cent of these children harboured streptococcus pyogenes in their throats. the numbers of streptococci other than group a and staphylococcus aureus were increased in the children with respiratory infections. however, staph. aureus was found as the sole organism in children with exudate more often than in the children with only uri. the possible role of  staph. aureus in bacterial pharyngitis should not be ignored. penicillin remains  a drug of choice for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. if penicillin is contraindicated, erythromycin should be preferred over lincomycin as a second choice of drug in order to avoid treatment failure if lincomycin resistant streptococci are present.

TI  == hr 756, a highly active cephalosporin: comparison with cefazolin and carbenicillin.
AB  == hr 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus spp. (indole positive), enterobacter spp., salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, providencia stuartii, and staphylococcus aureus. in every comparison, except that with the last organism, hr 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. all three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, hr 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. hr 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of streptococcus pyogenes,  lancefield group d streptococci, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against bacteriodes fragilis.  hr 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of  these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. hr 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against s. pyogenes; against lancefield group d,  penicillin was 32 times as active as hr 756. hr 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (p. aeruginosa and group d streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. a series of seven transfers of selected strains of e. coli, klebsiella spp., s. aureus, and p. aeruginosa through medium containing hr 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. resistance to hr 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.

AB  == group a streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type c (spe c) was shown to produce fever by crossing the blood-brain barrier. the toxin directly stimulated the hypothalamic fever response control center, thus bypassing a requirement for endogenous pyrogen release. spe c was detected in the cerebrospinal fluids of toxin-treated rabbits by pyrogen tests and a hemagglutination inhibition assay. the toxin altered the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to endotoxin, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae as well as to itself. spe c  did not alter the in vivo differential and total counts of peripheral blood leukocytes and did not elicit endogenous pyrogen release from leukocytes in vitro. in vivo, peripheral blood platelet counts remained unchanged after spe treatment. cycloheximide pretreatment of rabbits did not inhibit fever production by sp c. in contrast to the hypothermia observed in mice treated with endotoxin intravenously susceptibility to lethal endotoxin shock. the abilities of spe c to produce fever and enhance lethal shock were shown to be separate functions of the molecule; fever results from stimulation of the hypothalamus, and enhancement appears not to involve the central nervous system.

TI  == clinical and laboratory evaluation of cefamandole in infants and children.
AB  == fifty-three infants and children, aged three months to 15 years, were treated with an average daily dose of 100 mg of cefamandole/kg intravenously. of these patients, 47 had soft tissue cellulitis and six had pneumonia. primary pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, were isolated from 43 of the 53 patients. bacteremia was documented in six of the 53 patients. a satisfactory clinical and  bacteriologic response to cefamandole was achieved in all cases except on (98%).  the only treatment failure occurred in an infant with both periorbital cellulitis and bacteremia due to h. influenzae who developed meningitis while receiving cefamandole; no extravasation of the drug across the blood-brain barrier could be detected in spite of inflamed meninges. in general, the only aberrant effects of  cefamandole were the appearance of eosinophilia in 28% of patients and a positive indirect cooms' test without hemolysis in one patient. cefamandole showed excellent in vitro activity against 87 ampicillin-resistant strains of h. influenzae. because it has greater activity than any of the other cephalosporins  against this important pediatric pathogen, cefamandole may have particular pertinence in the treatment of infections in infants and young children.

TI  == in vitro sensitivity of hemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pyogenes to co-trimoxazole.
AB  == the invitro testing of hemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pyogenes for co-trimoxazole sensitivity requires certain "defined" media that have to be free  of inhibitory substances. the use of columbia agar base with fildes extract for h. influenzae or of blood agar for s. pyogenes may produce "false-resistant" strains. the addition of thymidine phosphorylases in the form of gentlylysed horse blood (2 to 10%) does not remove all inhibitors in those tests, especially  where "undefined" agar bases are used, and results in scanty growth of h. influenzae; the addition of more than 2% results in dark plates, making reading of sensitivities difficult. fildes agar for testing h. influenzae may be made with enriched sheep or horse blood if the proper "defined" agar base is used. the use of wellcotest or dst (oxoid) agar is recommended with fildes extract for h. influenzae or with blood for s. pyogenes for in vitro testing for co-trimoxazole  sensitivity. the addition of thymidine phosphorylase in the form of 2% lysed horse blood does not interfere with reading. however, it results in scanty growth of h. influenzae. proper inoculation of plates is important. the growth on the plates should be light, dense, but not confluent. heavy growth may render some strains "false-resistant" even when defined media are used. our results indicate  that many of the previously reported resistant strains of h. influenzae and s. pyogenes may have been "false-resistant" because of the use of "undefined" media. we believe that, in view of our results, respiratory infections may be treated with co-trimoxazole until bacteriologic studies prove that this treatment is contraindicated, since h. influenzae and s. pyogenes are usually found sensitive  in vitro under proper conditions.

TI  == immunoglobulins of the middle ear fluid in acute otitis media: relationship to serum immunoglobulin concentrations and bacterial cultures.
AB  == immunoglobulin concentrations were studied in 255 specimens of middle ear fluid (mef) from 165 episodes of acute otitis media in children. there were significant amounts of all three major immunoglobulins (ig) in mef, the mean concentration of iga being 39 mg/100 ml, of igm 63 mg/100 ml, and of igg 383 mg/100 ml. secretory  component was present in all 10 mef specimens in which it was sought. in patients over 9 months of age, there was a decreased likelihood of isolating pathogenic bacteria from mef if the patient had higher concentrations of iga in mef than in  simultaneously obtained serum. iga concentrations were greater in mef than in serum in almost half the patients, and the mean mef-serum ratio for iga was 1.38. thus, it would appear that in this disorder mef represents primarily a secretory  response to inflammation rather than a transudate.
