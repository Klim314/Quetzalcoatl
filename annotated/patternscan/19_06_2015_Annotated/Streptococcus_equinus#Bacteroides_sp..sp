TI  == susceptibility and resistance of ruminal bacteria to antimicrobial feed additives.
AB  == susceptibility and resistance of ruminal bacterial species to avoparcin, narasin, salinomycin, thiopeptin, tylosin, virginiamycin, and two new ionophore antibiotics, ro22-6924/004 and ro21-6447/009, were determined. generally, antimicrobial compounds were inhibitory to gram-positive bacteria and those bacteria that have gram-positive-like cell wall structure. mics ranged from 0.09  to 24.0 micrograms/ml. gram-negative bacteria were resistant at the highest concentration tested (48.0 micrograms/ml). on the basis of their fermentation products, ruminal bacteria that produce lactic acid, butyric acid, formic acid, or hydrogen were susceptible and bacteria that produce succinic acid or ferment lactic acid were resistant to the antimicrobial compounds. selenomonas ruminantium was the only major lactic acid-producing bacteria resistant to all the antimicrobial compounds tested. avoparcin and tylosin appeared to be less inhibitory (mic greater than 6.0 micrograms/ml) than the other compounds to the two major lactic acid-producing bacteria, streptococcus bovis and lactobacillus sp. ionophore compounds seemed to be more inhibitory (mic, 0.09 to 1.50 micrograms/ml) than nonionophore compounds (mic, 0.75 to 12.0 micrograms/ml) to the major butyric acid-producing bacteria. treponema bryantii, an anaerobic rumen spirochete, was less sensitive to virginiamycin than to the other antimicrobial compounds. ionophore compounds were generally bacteriostatic, and nonionophore compounds were bactericidal. the specific growth rate of bacteroides ruminicola was reduced by all the antimicrobial compounds except avoparcin. the antibacterial spectra of the feed additives were remarkably similar, and it appears that mics may not be good indicators of the potency of the compounds in altering ruminal fermentation characteristics.

TI  == isolation and identification of adherent epimural bacteria during succession in young lambs.
AB  == successive changes in aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts and changes in the generic composition of the epimural community in lambs from 1 to 10 weeks were determined. bacterial culture counts revealed a predominantly anaerobic community, with the mean anaerobic count being 1.4 x 10(7) cfu/cm2 of tissue surface. the aerobic count was highest at 1 week of age and declined significantly thereafter to a mean of 1.8 x 10(4) cfu/cm2, thus representing only 0.13% of the mean anaerobic count after week 1. of the 345 strains isolated anaerobically at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of age, 47, 32, 12, 32, 2, and 5% were capable of growth in a partially reduced medium, indicating a reduction in the number of facultative anaerobes with time. the majority of isolated strains were identified as belonging to genera commonly isolated from rumen contents. in  some instances, however, strains did not correspond to previously described species, and some genera were present in proportions different from those expected in rumen fluid. at three of the sampling times, one genus was dominant,  constituting 45 to 55% of the isolates. these dominant isolates were streptococcus bovis, bacteroides sp., and an anaerobic streptococcus sp. for weeks 1, 2, and 10, respectively. during the transition period (weeks 4 to 8), two or more groups were codominant.

TI  == isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  == one hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a  hay-grain ration. before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings  were counted. calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of  attached bacteria also occurred. nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. most of these types were represented among the isolates. characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed  that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), bacteroides sp. (22.4%), selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), streptococcus bovis (8.1%), propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), treponema sp. (3.1%), and eubacterium sp., lachnospira multiparus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5%  each). eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. l. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. all s. bovis strains and two strains each of bacteroides sp. and butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (r. j. wallace, k.-j. cheng, d. dinsdale, and e. r. orskov, nature (london) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. the term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.
