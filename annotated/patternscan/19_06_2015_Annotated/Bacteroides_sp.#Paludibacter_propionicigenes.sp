TI  == spatiotemporal development of the bacterial community in a tubular longitudinal microbial fuel cell.
AB  == the spatiotemporal development of a bacterial community in an exoelectrogenic biofilm was investigated in sucrose-fed longitudinal tubular microbial fuel cell  reactors, consisting of two serially connected modules. the proportional changes  in the microbial community composition were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and dna sequencing in order to relate them to the performance and stability of the bioelectrochemical system. the reproducibility of duplicated reactors, evaluated by cluster analysis and jaccard's coefficient, shows 80-90% similarity in species composition. biofilm development through fed-batch start-up and subsequent stable continuous operation results in a population shift from gamma-proteobacteria- and bacteroidetes- to firmicutes-dominated communities, with other diverse species present at much lower relative proportions. dgge patterns were analysed by range-weighted richness (rr) and pareto-lorenz evenness distribution curves to investigate the evolution of the bacterial community. the first modules shifted from dominance by species closely related to bacteroides graminisolvens, raoultella ornithinolytica and klebsiella sp. bm21 at the start of continuous-mode operation to a community dominated by paludibacter propionicigenes-, lactococcus sp.-, pantoea agglomerans- and klebsiella oxytoca-related species with stable power generation (6.0 w/m(3)) at day 97. operational strategies that consider the dynamics of the population will provide  useful parameters for evaluating system performance in the practical application  of microbial fuel cells.

TI  == paludibacter propionicigenes gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel strictly anaerobic, gram-negative, propionate-producing bacterium isolated from plant residue in irrigated rice-field soil in japan.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic, propionate-producing bacterial strain (wb4t) isolated from  rice plant residue in anoxic rice-field soil in japan was characterized phenotypically and phylogenetically. cells were gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, short rods. the strain utilized various sugars and produced propionate and acetate as major fermentation products with a small amount of succinate. the optimum growth temperature was 30 degrees c. oxidase, catalase and nitrate-reducing activities were negative. the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c(15 : 0), c(15 : 0) and anteiso-c(17 : 0) 3-oh. menaquinone mk-8(h4) was the major respiratory quinone. the genomic dna g+c content was 39.3 mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna gene sequence placed the strain in the phylum 'bacteroidetes'. the closest relative to strain wb4t was an environmental clone from water contaminated with equine manure (sequence similarity of 99.7 %) and the strain formed a distinct cluster with other environmental clones mainly from freshwater sediments. the closest recognized species were members of the genus dysgonomonas, with 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of 90.9-89.8 %. bacteroides merdae was the next closest recognized species (similarity of 88.7 % to the type strain). given that the ecological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain wb4t were different from those of any related species, a new genus and species paludibacter propionicigenes gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate it. the type strain is wb4t (= jcm 13257t = dsm 17365t).
