TI  - Rifampin, a useful drug for nonmycobacterial infections.
AB  - Rifampin has clinical efficacy against a wide variety of organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella pneumophila, group A Streptococcus, Brucella sp, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, as well as in vitro activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Haemophilus ducreyi, and many gram-negative rods. Rifampin is a useful drug for several types of bacterial infections because of its broad spectrum of activity, excellent tissue penetration, and low side effect profile. In combination with other antibiotics, it may be effective when conventional therapies are not.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of quinolones.
AB  - The quinolones are new antimicrobial agents that are descendants of nalidixic acid. As a new class of synthetic antimicrobials they exhibit a wide spectrum of activity. Newer quinolones such as ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, enoxacin, and pefloxacin are highly active against gram negative bacilli of the Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus ducreyi. They exhibit less activity against Pseudomonas sp. and Staphylococcus sp., and little in vitro activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae or Enterococci. Their activity against Mycobacterium sp. is variable, and obligate anaerobes are usually considered resistant. Of the quinolones reviewed, ciprofloxacin displays the highest degree of in vitro activity.
TI  - Roxithromycin. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  - Roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. It has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. Roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. The results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. Clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. In a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. Roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of ofloxacin.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared with that of nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, enoxacin, pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Ofloxacin was very active against nalidixic acid-susceptible isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae (MIC less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) and was also active against strains resistant to nalidixic acid (MIC less than or equal to 2 mg/l). The activity was similar to norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin but some four-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin. All of the fluoroquinolones were highly active against Vibrio cholerae (MIC less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), V. parahaemolyticus (MIC less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) Aeromonas hydrophila (MIC less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l), Plesiomonas shigelloides (MIC less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), Campylobacter jejuni (MIC less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l), Neisseria spp., Haemophilus influenzae, H. ducreyi, Bordetella pertussis and Legionella pneumophila (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l for all species). Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin (MIC less than or equal to 1, 2 and 2 mg/l, respectively) showed similar activity against Staphylococcus spp. and were somewhat more active than enoxacin (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l) and norfloxacin (MIC less than or equal to 8 mg/l). Ofloxacin was moderately active against beta-haemolytic Streptococcus spp. (MIC less than or equal to 2 mg/l), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and Cory. jeikeium (MIC less than or equal to 2 mg/l) and somewhat less active against alpha- and non-haemolytic Streptococcus spp., Str. pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l for all species) and Str. faecalis (MIC less than or equal to 8 mg/l). The activity of ofloxacin, against these species, was similar to ciprofloxacin and four to eight times greater than norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin. Ofloxacin, and all of the fluoroquinolones, were less active against anaerobic than aerobic bacteria. Clostridium perfringens (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) was more susceptible to ofloxacin than were other anaerobic species and Cl. difficile (MIC less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was more resistant. Ofloxacin was the most active compound tested against Chlamydia trachomatis SA2f (MIC less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l) with only ciprofloxacin (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) approaching similar activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The clinical use of macrolides.
AB  - Macrolides are active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella spp. and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the main causes of community-acquired pneumonia They may therefore be used for the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, although emergent resistance in Str. pneumoniae limits their use in some parts of the world. In patients with bronchitis the use of macrolides reduces the severity and duration of symptoms. Macrolides have also been used successfully in the treatment of otitis media and sinusitis; combination with sulphonamides may be desirable. They may be effective in eradicating the carrier state of Str. pyogenes, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diptheriae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Macrolides provide alternative therapy for the prophylaxis of recurrent acute rheumatic fever and of infective endocarditis after dental treatment. The cure rate with macrolides of streptococcal skin infections and of minor staphylococcal infections is equal to that achieved with penicillins. In diarrhoea due to Campylobacter jejuni, the administration of macrolides shortens the duration of the faecal excretion of organisms and may give clinical improvement in severe disease. Macrolides are the drugs of choice for infections due to Chlamydia trachomatis in pregnancy and for Haemophilus ducreyi infections. They are effective alternative therapy to benzylpenicillin for the treatment of N. gonorrhoeae and Treponema pallidum infections.
