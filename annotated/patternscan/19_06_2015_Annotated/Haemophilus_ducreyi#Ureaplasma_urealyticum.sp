TI  == ofloxacin. a reappraisal of its use in the management of genitourinary tract infections.
AB  == ofloxacin is an established fluoroquinolone agent which achieves good concentrations in genitourinary tract tissues and fluids. it has good in vitro activity against most enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus saprophyticus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis and haemophilus ducreyi, intermediate activity against ureaplasma urealyticum and most enterococci, but limited or no in vitro activity against enterococci, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and many anaerobes. however, high concentrations achieved in the urine ensure its activity against most urinary tract pathogens. ofloxacin demonstrates consistent efficacy in a broad range of urinary tract infections, achieving bacteriological response rates in excess of 80% in uncomplicated and 70% in complicated infections. the efficacy of ofloxacin was similar to that of all comparators tested including other fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). ofloxacin is also effective as a single-dose regimen in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea, as a 7-day regimen in uncomplicated c. trachomatis infections, and as monotherapy in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). again, ofloxacin  demonstrated similar efficacy to alternative treatments in each type of infection. the availability of an intravenous formulation and near-complete oral  bioavailability allow ofloxacin to be administered as a sequential regimen without loss of activity. the tolerability and drug interaction profile of ofloxacin is consistent with that of other fluoroquinolones. the most commonly reported adverse events with ofloxacin are gastrointestinal, neurological and dermatological. it was associated with a lower incidence of photosensitivity and  tendinitis and higher incidence of some neurological events than some other fluoroquinolones. ofloxacin seems to have a lower propensity to interact with xanthines than other fluoroquinolones. conclusion: ofloxacin has established efficacy in the treatment of a wide variety of urinary tract infections, although, like other fluoroquinolones, it should be used rationally to preserve its activity. currently, ofloxacin also holds an important place among fluoroquinolones in the treatment of c. trachomatis infections and uncomplicated  pid, although its acceptance as monotherapy in pid is likely to depend on clarification of the causative role of anaerobic pathogens in this infection.

TI  == the role of fluoroquinolones in sexually transmitted diseases.
AB  == the management of sexually transmitted diseases (stds) has reached a new level in the era of antibiotic resistance and human immunodeficiency virus infection. to date, no single antimicrobial is capable of eradicating the commonly encountered  std pathogens including neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, and treponema pallidum. among the marketed fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and enoxacin all provide excellent in vitro activity (mic90 < 0.06 micrograms/ml) and excellent in vivo efficacy against n. gonorrhoeae, including multiply resistant isolates (penicillinase-producing n. gonorrhoeae and chromosomally mediated resistant n. gonorrhoeae). ofloxacin is the only fluoroquinolone approved by the food and drug administration for chlamydial infection. all of the quinolones lack reliable in vitro activity against ureaplasma urealyticum, a cause of nongonococcal urethritis. although limited data suggest the usefulness of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease, these drugs cannot currently be recommended for single-agent therapy. haemophilus ducreyi infections, however, can be managed effectively with the fluoroquinolones. although their role continues to evolve, this class of drugs cannot be used equally to treat all stds, and notably, no quinolone to date inhibits t. pallidum.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.

TI  == characterization of the tet m determinants in urogenital and respiratory bacteria.
AB  == tetracycline-resistant fusobacterium nucleatum, haemophilus ducreyi, mycoplasma hominis, peptostreptococcus spp., ureaplasma urealyticum, and veillonella parvula had dna sequences which showed homology throughout the length of the tet m transposon, tn916. in contrast, gardnerella vaginalis, commensal neisseria spp.,  and the 25.2-megadalton plasmid family lacked the complete transposon.

TI  == in vitro activity of ofloxacin against chlamydia trachomatis.
AB  == the activity of ofloxacin against chlamydia trachomatis isolates obtained from eight metropolitan areas in the united states has been evaluated. growth of c. trachomatis in first passage was completely inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml of ofloxacin (all 27 isolates tested). the bactericidal effect (inability to pass in the absence of antibiotics) was less than or equal to 1 microgram for 26 of the 27 isolates. other studies have shown that less than 0.1 microgram/ml of ofloxacin is the minimal inhibitory concentration for 90 percent of strains tested (mic90) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and less than 2 micrograms/ml is the mic90 for haemophilus ducreyi. ofloxacin is less active (mic90, 8 to 25 micrograms/ml) against ureaplasma urealyticum. these in vitro results suggest that ofloxacin may be useful in the treatment of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases. because there is a need for a single antibiotic active against both chlamydiae and gonococci, this quinolone could play an important role in the management of these infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus ducreyi, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  == the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new difluorinated quinolone antimicrobial was compared to comparative agents against organisms causing sexually transmitted diseases. against chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus ducreyi, lomefloxacin exhibited mic90 of 2.0, 8.0, 8.0, less than or equal to 0.015, and 0.003 micrograms/ml, respectively. overall, the lomefloxacin activity was very similar to ciprofloxacin.

TI  == a review of the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin against genital pathogens.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin against neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, treponema pallidum, gardnerella vaginalis and haemophilus ducreyi is reviewed. roxithromycin demonstrated equivalent activity to erythromycin against n. gonorrhoeae, c. trachomatis, m. hominis, u. urealyticum, g. vaginalis and h. ducreyi. in a rabbit model for syphilis, potentially useful activity against t. pallidum has been demonstrated.
