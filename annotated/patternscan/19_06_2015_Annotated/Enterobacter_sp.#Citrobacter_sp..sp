TI  == [selective-differential nutrient medium "shewanella irhls agar" for isolation of  shewanella genus bacteria].
AB  == aim: development of a selective-differential nutrient medium for isolation of shewanella genus bacteria. materials and methods: 73 strains of shewanella bacteria (s. algae--3, s. baltica--26, s. putrefaciens--44) and 80 strains of 22  other bacteria genera were used. shewanella species were identified by methods and criteria proposed by nozue h. et al., 1992; khashe s. et al., 1998. results:  nutrient media "shewanella irhls agar" for shewanella isolation was developed. medium selective factors: irgazan dp-300 (i). 0.14-0.2 g/l and rifampicin (r) 0.0005-0.001 g/l. shevanella colonies were detected by the production of hydrogen sulfide (h), lipase presence (l), lack of sorbitol fermentation (s). the medium suppressed the growth of hydrogen sulfide producers (salmonella, proteus) and blocked hydrogen sulfide production by citrobacter. growth of escherichia, enterobacter, klebsiella, shigella, staphylococcus, bacillus was also suppressed, analytical sensitivity of the medium was 1-2 cfu/ml for shewanella and stenotrophomonas, aerombnas, serratia genera bacteria. 72 strains of shewanella were isolated from water of neva river in this medium, 91.7 +/- 3.2% of those produced h2s. 1 strain of s. algae was isolated from clinical material. conclusion: the developed media allows to use it in a complex for stenotrophomo-  nas sp., aeromonas sp., serratia sp., citrobactersp. and shewanella bacteria isolation.

TI  == biosorption of heavy metals by pseudomonas species isolated from sugar industry.
AB  == heavy metal-resistant bacteria can be efficient bioremediators of metals and may  provide an alternative or additional method to conventional methods of metal removal. in this study, 10 bacterial isolates were isolated from soil samples of  a sugar industry, located at peshawar, pakistan. morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of these isolates were observed. sequence analysis (16s ribosomal rna) revealed that isolated strains were closely related  to the species belonging to the genera pseudomonas, arthrobacter, exiguobacterium, citrobacter, and enterobacter. bacterial isolates were resistant with a minimum inhibitory concentration (500-900 ppm) to lead ion (pb2+), (500-600 ppm) nickel ion (ni2+), (500-800 ppm) copper ion (cu2+), and (600-800 ppm) chromium ion (cr3+) in solid media. furthermore, biosorption of metals proved considerable removal of heavy metals by isolated metal-resistant strains.  pseudomonas sp. reduced 37% (pb2+), 32% (ni2+), 29% (cu2+), and 32% (cr3+) and was thus found to be most effective, whereas enterobacter sp. reduced 19% (pb2+), 7% (ni2+), 14% (cu2+), and 21% (cr3+) and was found to be least effective. while  average reduction of pb2+, ni2+, cu2+, and cr3+ by citrobacter sp. was found to be 24%, 18%, 23%, and 27%, respectively, among recognized species. this study revealed that pseudomonas sp. may provide a new microbial community that can be used for enhanced remediation of contaminated environment.

TI  == dynamics of mdr enterobacter cloacae outbreaks in a neonatal unit in nepal: insights using wider sampling frames and next-generation sequencing.
AB  == objectives: there are limited data on enterobacter cloacae outbreaks and fewer describing these in association with ndm-1. with whole-genome sequencing, we tested the hypothesis that a cluster of 16 e. cloacae bacteraemia cases in a nepali neonatal unit represented a single clonal outbreak, using a wider set of epidemiologically unrelated clinical e. cloacae isolates for comparison. methods: forty-three isolates were analysed, including 23 e. cloacae and 3 citrobacter sp. isolates obtained from blood cultures from 16 neonates over a 3 month period. these were compared with two contemporaneous community-associated drug-resistant  isolates from adults, a unit soap dispenser isolate and a set of historical invasive isolates (n=14) from the same geographical locality. results: there were two clear neonatal outbreaks and one isolated case in the unit. one outbreak was  associated with an ndm-1 plasmid also identified in a historical community-associated strain. the smaller, second outbreak was likely associated with a contaminated soap dispenser. the two community-acquired adult cases and three sets of historical hospital-associated neonatal isolates represented four additional genetic clusters. conclusions: e. cloacae infections in this context represent several different transmission networks, operating at the community/hospital and host strain/plasmid levels. wide sampling frames and high-resolution typing methods are needed to describe the complex molecular epidemiology of e. cloacae outbreaks, which is not appropriately reflected by routine susceptibility phenotypes. soap dispensers may represent a reservoir for  e. cloacae and bacterial strains and plasmids may persist in hospitals and in the community for long periods, sporadically being involved in outbreaks of disease.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamases in faecal enterobacteriaceae recovered from healthy humans in spain: focusing on ampc polymorphisms.
AB  == the intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampc genes in species of citrobacter, enterobacter or escherichia genera. in this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampc beta-lactamase  genes. fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 escherichia coli, 4 citrobacter braakii, 9 citrobacter freundii, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 proteus vulgaris, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 serratia sp. and 1 cronobacter sp. a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the ampc phenotype in 22  isolates (31 %) and the esbl phenotype in 3 isolates. ampc molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla cmy and bla act genes from citrobacter and enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. the prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampc genes obtained in this study was 2 %. the unique plasmid-mediated bla ampc identified in this study was the bla cmy-2 gene, detected in an e. coli isolate ascribed to  the sequence type st405 which belonged to phylogenetic group d. the hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the isecp1-bla cmy-2-blc structure  was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable inck plasmid. this study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. extensive ampc-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.

TI  == molecular detection of esbls production and antibiotic resistance patterns in gram negative bacilli isolated from urinary tract infections.
AB  == background: beta-lactam resistance is more prevalent in gram negative bacterial isolates worldwide, particularly in developing countries. in order to provide data relating to antibiotic therapy and resistance control, routine monitoring of corresponding antibiotic resistance genes is necessary. aims: the aim of this study was the characterization of beta-lactam resistance genes and its plasmid profile in bacteria isolated from urinary tract infection samples. materials and  methods: in this study, 298 gram negative bacteria isolated from 6739 urine specimens were identified by biochemical standard tests. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains were also detected by the double-disk synergy test. the presence of blatem and blashv genes in the strains studied was ascertained by polymerase chain reaction. results: of all gram negative bacteria, escherichia coli (69.1%) was the most common strain, followed by klebsiella sp. (12.1%), enterobacter sp. (8.4%), proteus sp. (4.4%),  citrobacter (4%) and pseudomonas sp. (2%). the most antibiotic resistance was shown to tetracycline (95.16%), nalidixic acid (89.78%) and gentamycin (73.20%) antibiotics. among all the strains tested, 35 isolates (11.75%) expressed esbl activity. the prevalence of tem and shv positivity among these isolates was 34.29%, followed by tem (31.43%), tem and shv negativity (20.0%) and shv (14.29%), respectively. conclusions: regular monitoring of antimicrobial drug resistance seems necessary to improve our guidelines in the use of the empirical  antibiotic therapy.

TI  == are community environmental surfaces near hospitals reservoirs for gram-negative  nosocomial pathogens?
AB  == background: hospital visitors and staff visit neighboring businesses, creating the potential for contamination of surfaces with hospital flora. methods: cultures were obtained from environmental surfaces in hospital lobbies and the surrounding community of 6 hospitals in brooklyn, ny. as a control, cultures were taken from surfaces >1.5 miles from any hospital. screening for beta-lactamases was done by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and select isolates were fingerprinted by the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr method. results: of 493 cultures, most (70%) involved doors from local businesses. cephalosporin-resistant citrobacter freundii (n = 3), escherichia coli (n = 2), and enterobacter sp (n = 2) were recovered from surfaces near hospitals, but not  from control sites. one isolate of stenotrophomonas maltophilia harbored an integron-associated vim-2. acinetobacter baumannii was recovered in 15 samples, including 4.5% of swabs from </=0.5 miles of the hospitals versus 0% from >/=0.6  miles (p = .004). eleven a baumannii isolates were clonally related by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr and were also related to a known clinical isolate. conclusions: strains of a baumannii and cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae can be recovered from environmental surfaces surrounding hospitals. finding these pathogens in the perihospital environment suggests hand  cleansing should be emphasized for all people entering and leaving hospitals. the finding of integron-associated vim-2 in our region is disconcerting, and further  vigilance is warranted.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of biofouling bacteria and profiling of  quorum sensing signal molecules from membrane bioreactor activated sludge.
AB  == the formation of biofilm in a membrane bioreactor depends on the production of various signaling molecules like n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls). in the present study, a total of 200 bacterial strains were isolated from membrane bioreactor activated sludge and screened for ahls production using two biosensor  systems, chromobacterium violaceum cv026 and agrobacterium tumefaciens a136. a correlation between ahls production and biofilm formation has been made among screened ahls producing strains. the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed the dominance of aeromonas and enterobacter sp. in ahls production; however few a species of serratia, leclercia, pseudomonas, klebsiella, raoultella and citrobacter were also identified. the chromatographic characterization of sludge  extract showed the presence of a broad range of quorum sensing signal molecules.  further identification of sludge ahls by thin layer chromatography bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography confirms the presence of c4-hsl, c6-hsl, c8-hsl, 3-oxo-c8-hsl, c10-hsl, c12-hsl, 3-oxo-c12-hsl and c14-hsl. the occurrence of ahls in sludge extract and dominance of aeromonas and enterobacter sp. in activated sludge suggests the key role of these bacterial strains in ahls production and thereby membrane fouling.

TI  == pseudocitrobacter gen. nov., a novel genus of the enterobacteriaceae with two new species pseudocitrobacter faecalis sp. nov., and pseudocitrobacter anthropi sp. nov, isolated from fecal samples from hospitalized patients in pakistan.
AB  == four isolates of gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacteria, three of them producing ndm-1 carbapenemase, were isolated from hospitalized patients and outpatients attending two military hospitals in rawalpindi, pakistan, and studied for their taxonomic position. initially the strains were phenotypically identified as citrobacter species. comparative analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences then showed that the four strains shared >97%, but in no case >98.3%, 16s rrna gene sequence similarities to members of the genera citrobacter, kluyvera, pantoea, enterobacter and raoultella, but always formed a separate cluster in respective phylogenetic trees. based on multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) including partial recn, rpoa, thdf and rpob gene sequence and respective amino acid sequence analysis it turned out that the strains also here always formed separate clusters. based on further comparative analyses including dna-dna hybridizations, genomic fingerprint analysis using rep- and rapd-pcrs and physiological tests, it is proposed to classify these four strains into the novel genus pseudocitrobacter gen. nov. with a new species pseudocitrobacter faecalis sp. nov. with strain 25 cit(t) (=ccm 8479(t)=lmg 27751(t)) and pseudocitrobacter  anthropi sp. nov. with strain c138(t) (=ccm 8478(t)=lmg 27750(t)), as the type strains, respectively.

TI  == mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyra and parc in enterobacteriaceae isolates from brazil.
AB  == mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) in chromosomal gyra and parc genes and fluoroquinolone susceptibility profiles were investigated in quinolone-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolated from community and hospitalized patients in the brazilian southeast region. a total of 112 nalidixic acid-resistant enterobacterial isolates collected from 2000 to 2005 were investigated for mutations in the topoisomerases genes gyra and parc by amplifying and sequencing the qrdr regions. susceptibility to fluoroquinolones was tested by the agar dilution method. amongst the 112 enterobacterial isolates, 81 (72.3%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 5 (4.5%) showed reduced susceptibility. twenty-six (23.2%) were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. several alterations were detected in gyra and parc genes. escherichia coli isolates (47.7%) showed double mutations in the gyra gene and a single one in the parc gene. two unusual aminoacid substitutions are reported, an asp87-asn in a citrobacter freundii isolate with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and  a glu84-ala in one e. coli isolate. only a parc gene mutation was found in fluoroquinolone-susceptible enterobacter aerogenes. none of the isolates susceptible to ciprofloxacin presented mutations in topoisomerase genes. this comprehensive analysis of qrdrs in gyra and parc genes, covering commonly isolated enterobacteriaceae in brazil is the largest reported up to now.

TI  == determination of antimicrobial and heavy metal resistance profiles of some bacteria isolated from aquatic amphibian and reptile species.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to determine the level of antibiotic resistance  patterns and distribution of heavy metal resistance of bacterial isolates from aquatic animals (lissotriton vulgaris, pelophylax ridibundus, emys orbicularis, mauremys rivulata, and natrix natrix) in turkey (kavak delta). a total of 153 bacteria have been successfully isolated from cloaca and oral samples of the aquatic amphibians and reptilians which were found, namely, aeromonas sp. (n = 29), plesiomonas sp. (n = 7), vibrio sp. (n = 12), citrobacter sp. (n = 12), enterobacter sp. (n = 11), escherichia sp. (n = 22), klebsiella sp. (n = 22), edwardsiella sp. (n = 6), hafnia sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 19), providencia sp. (n = 8), and pseudomonas sp. (n = 4). in terms of antibiotic and heavy metal  susceptibility testing, each isolate was tested against 12 antibiotics and 4 metals. there was a high incidence of resistance to cefoxitin (46.40 %), ampicillin (44.44 %), erythromycin (35.29 %), and a low incidence of resistance to gentamicin (6.53 %), kanamycin (8.49 %), chloramphenicol (9.15 %), and cefotaxime (10.45 %). the multiple antibiotic resistance index of each bacterial  species indicated that bacteria from raised amphibians and reptiles have been exposed to tested antibiotics, with results ranging from 0 to 0.58. most isolates showed tolerance to different concentrations of heavy metals, and minimal inhibition concentrations ranged from100 to >3,200 mug/ml. according to these results, a significant occurrence of bacteria in the internal organs of reptiles  and amphibians, with a high incidence of resistance against antibiotics and heavy metals, may risk aquatic animals and the public health. these data appoint the importance of epidemiological surveillance and microbiological monitoring and reinforce the need to implement environment protection programs for amphibian and reptile species.

TI  == resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a wwtp.
AB  == the microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. this fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli (three strains), enterobacter cloacae, kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), kluyvera intermedia, citrobacter freundii (two strains), bacillus sp. and enterobacter sp. the first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.l(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees c). the results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.l(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees c for 30 min. the other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.l(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). the results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == enterobacterial detection and escherichia coli antimicrobial resistance in parrots seized from the illegal wildlife trade.
AB  == enteric bacteria are considered important potential pathogens in avian clinical medicine, causing either primary or opportunistic infections. the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of enterobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of psittacine birds and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility  of the escherichia coli isolates cultured. fecal samples were collected from 300  parrots captured from the illegal wildlife trade in goias, brazil and were processed using conventional bacteriological procedures. a total of 508 isolates  were obtained from 300 fecal samples: 172 e. coli (33.9% of isolates; 57.3% of individuals); 153 enterobacter spp. (30.1% of isolates; 51.0% of individuals); 89 klebsiella spp. (17.7% of isolates; 29.7% of individuals); 59 citrobacter spp. (11.6% of isolates; 19.7% of individuals), 21 proteus vulgaris (4.2% of isolates; 7.0% of individuals), 5 providencia alcalifaciens (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 5 serratia sp. (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 3 hafnia  aivei (0.59% of isolates; 1.00% of individuals), and 1 salmonella sp. (0.20% of isolates; 0.33% of individuals). escherichia coli isolates were subsequently tested for susceptibility to the following antibiotics: amoxicillin (70.93% of the isolates were resistant), ampicillin (75.58%), ciprofloxacin (23.25%), chloramphenicol (33.14%), doxycycline (64.53%), enrofloxacin (41.28%), tetracycline (69.19%), and sulfonamide (71.51%). multi-resistance to three and four groups of antibiotics occurred in 40 samples (23.25%) and 4 samples (2.32%), respectively. these results demonstrate that illegally traded birds are carriers  of potentially pathogenic bacteria, including e. coli strains with antimicrobial  resistance.

TI  == distribution of chitin/chitosan-like bioflocculant-producing potential in the genus citrobacter.
AB  == some strains belonging to the genera citrobacter and enterobacter have been reported to produce chitin/chitosan-like bioflocculants (bfs) from acetate. in this study, to investigate the distribution of the bf-producing potential in the  genus citrobacter and to screen stably and highly bf-producing strains, we obtained 36 citrobacter strains from different culture collection centers, which  were distributed among seven species in the genus, and tested for the flocculating activities of their culture supernatants using a kaolin suspension method. as a result, 21 strains belonging to c. freundii (17 strains in 23 strains tested), c. braakii (two in two), c. youngae (one in one), and c. werkmanii (one in two) showed flocculating activity, but this ability was limited to cells grown on acetate. gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (gc/ms) analysis  of the hydrolysates from the bfs of five selected strains indicated that they consisted of glucosamine and/or n-acetylglucosamine, such as the chitin/chitosan-like bf (bf04) produced by citrobacter sp. tkf04 (fujita et al. j biosci bioeng 89: 40-46, 2000). gel filtration chromatography using a high-performance liquid chromatography system revealed that the molecular weight  ranges of these bfs varied, but the average sizes were all above 1.66 x 10(6)da.

TI  == de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia due to difficult-to-treat  gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == purpose: to examine the status and clinical outcome of de-escalating antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia due to hospital-acquired, gram-negative bacilli that are difficult to treat. methods: among 1,610 patients presenting with positive blood cultures collected at our medical centre over a 6-year period, 133 were infected with serratia, pseudomonas, acinetobacter, citrobacter  or enterobacter sp. (spaces). we examined the appropriateness of an empiric initial administration of antimicrobials based on in vitro sensitivity, and the success and outcomes of a pathogen-directed de-escalation of therapy. the treatment was considered to be successfully de-escalated when the antimicrobial spectrum was narrowed according to a spectrum ranking or when >/= 2 antimicrobials prescribed initially were lowered to one agent. outcome measures included persistent, recurrent and metastatic infections, infection-related deaths and cost of antimicrobials. results: the treatment was initially appropriate in 79 of 133 patients (59 %), of whom 49 (62 %) were candidates for and 28 (57 %) underwent treatment de-escalation. no treatment failure was observed among these 28 patients, while 2 of 11 patients (18 %) whose treatment was not de-escalated died (p = 0.13). the median cost of antimicrobials was <euro>250/patient lower in the de-escalated than in the non-de-escalated group (p < 0.001). conclusions: antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia due to hard-to-treat spaces was de-escalated in 57 % of candidates, based on the in vitro sensitivity, with no deaths and significantly lower costs of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == biohydrogen production by dark fermentation of glycerol using enterobacter and citrobacter sp.
AB  == glycerol is an attractive substrate for biohydrogen production because, in theory, it can produce 3 mol of hydrogen per mol of glycerol. moreover, glycerol  is produced in substantial amounts as a byproduct of producing biodiesel, the demand for which has increased in recent years. therefore, hydrogen production from glycerol was studied by dark fermentation using three strains of bacteria: namely, enterobacter sph1, enterobacter sph2, and citrobacter freundii h3 and a mixture thereof (1:1:1). it was found that, when an initial concentration of 20 g/l of glycerol was used, all three strains and their mixture produced substantial amounts of hydrogen ranging from 2400 to 3500 ml/l, being highest for c. freundii h3 (3547 ml/l) and enterobacter sph1 (3506 ml/l). the main nongaseous fermentation products were ethanol and acetate, albeit in different ratios. for enterobacter sph1, enterobacter sph2, c. freundii h3, and the mixture (1:1:1), the ethanol yields (in mol etoh/mol glycerol consumed) were 0.96, 0.67, 0.31, and 0.66, respectively. compared to the individual strains, the mixture (1:1:1) did not show a significantly higher hydrogen level, indicating that there was no synergistic effect. enterobacter sph1 was selected for further investigation because of its higher yield of hydrogen and ethanol.

AB  == diversity and prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were investigated in environmental bacteria isolated from surface seawater of jiaozhou bay, china. five qnr gene alleles were identified in 34 isolates by pcr  amplification, including qnra3 gene in a shewanella algae isolate, qnrb9 gene in  a citrobacter freundii isolate, qnrd gene in 22 proteus vulgaris isolates, qnrs1  gene in 1 enterobacter sp. and 4 klebsiella spp. isolates, and qnrs2 gene in 1 pseudomonas sp. and 4 pseudoalteromonas sp. isolates. the qnrc, aac(6')-ib-cr, and qepa genes could not be detected in this study. the 22 qnrd-positive proteus  vulgaris isolates could be differentiated into four genotypes based on eric-pcr assay. the qnrs1 and qnrd genes could be transferred to escherichia coli j53 azi(r) or e. coli top10 recipient strains using conjugation or transformation methods. among the 34 qnr-positive isolates, 30 had a single point mutation in the qrdrs of gyra protein (ala67ser, ser83ile, or ser83thr), indicating that cooperation of chromosome- and plasmid-mediated resistance contributed to the spread and evolution of quinolone resistance in this coastal bay. eighty-five percent of the isolates were also found to be resistant to ampicillin, and bla(cmy), bla(oxy), bla(shv), and bla(tem) genes were detected in five isolates that also harbored the qnrb9 or qnrs1 gene. our current study is the first identification of qnrs2 gene in pseudoalteromonas and pseudomonas strains, and qnrd gene in proteus vulgaris strains. high prevalence of diverse qnr genes in jiaozhou bay indicates that coastal seawater may serve as an important reservoir, natural source, and dissemination vehicle of quinolone resistance determinants.

TI  == rectal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli in community settings in madagascar.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum ss-lactamase-producing enterobacteria (esbl-pe) emerged at the end of the 1980s, causing nosocomial outbreaks and/or hyperendemic situations in hospitals and long-term care facilities. in recent years, community-acquired infections due to esbl-pe have spread worldwide, especially across developing countries including madagascar. objectives: this study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal carriage of esbl-pe in the community of antananarivo. methods: non-hospitalized patients were recruited  in three health centers in different socio economic settings. fresh stool collected were immediately plated on drigalski agar containing 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxone. gram-negative bacilli species were identified and esbl production was tested by a double disk diffusion (cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanate) assay. characterization of esbls were perfomed by pcr and direct sequencing. molecular epidemiology was analysed by rep-pcr and eric-pcr. results: 484 patients were screened (sex ratio = 1.03, median age 28 years). 53 esbl-pe were isolated from 49 patients (carrier rate 10.1%). the isolates included escherichia coli (31), klebsiella pneumoniae (14), enterobacter cloacae (3), citrobacter freundii (3), kluyvera spp. (1) and pantoae sp. (1). in multivariate  analysis, only the socioeconomic status of the head of household was independently associated with esbl-pe carriage, poverty being the predominant risk factor. conclusions: the prevalence of carriage of esbl in the community of  antananarivo is one of the highest reported worldwide. this alarming spread of resistance genes should be stopped urgently by improving hygiene and streamlining the distribution and consumption of antibiotics.

TI  == occurrence of yeasts, pseudomonads and enteric bacteria in the oral cavity of patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of yeasts, pseudomonads and  enteric bacteria in the oral cavity of patients undergoing radiotherapy (rt) for  treatment of head and neck cancer. fifty patients receiving rt were examined before, during and 30 days after rt. saliva, mucosa, and biofilm samples were collected and microorganisms were detected by culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the most prevalent yeasts in patients submitted to rt were candida albicans, c. tropicalis, c. krusei, c. glabrata and c. parapsilosis. citrobacter, enterobacter, enterococcus, klebsiella, proteus, and pseudomonas were the most frequently cultivated bacteria. before rt, targeted bacteria were cultivated from 22.2% of edentulous patients and 16.6% of dentate patients; 30 days after rt, these microorganisms were recovered from 77.8% edentulous and 46.8% dentate patients. by pcr, these microorganisms were detected from all edentulous patients, 78.1% of dentate patients. the presence of gram-negative enteric roads and fungi was particularly frequent in patients presenting mucositis level iii or iv. modifications in the oral environment due to rt treatment seem to facilitate the colonization of oral cavity by members of family enterobacteriaceae, genera enterococcus and candida.

TI  == the influence of environmental bacteria in freshwater stingray wound-healing.
AB  == invasion by bacteria can influence the course of healing of wounds acquired in aquatic environment. in this study, the bacteria present in potamotrygon motoro stingray mucus and in the alto parana river water were identified, and their ability to induce tissue injury and resist antibiotics was determined. biochemical identification analysis showed that 97% of all bacterial isolates were gram negative, aeromonas spp., enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii being the species most prevalent. gelatinase and caseinase were produced by aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas sobria and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. erythrocyte hemolysis assay showed that a. sobria, a. hydrophila and to a lesser  extent, other gram-negative bacteria produced hemolysin. it was also observed that molecules released in culture by these bacteria were toxic to human epithelial cells. antibiogram results showed that 68% of all bacterial isolates were resistant to at least one type of antibiotic, mainly b-lactams. finally, it  was demonstrated that although p. motoro venom was toxic to epithelial cells it did not influence bacterial proliferation. in summary, the results obtained in this work indicate that during the accident, the mucus of p. motoro and the environmental water may transfer into the wound pathogenic multi-resistant bacteria with the potential to cause severe secondary infections.

TI  == analysis of the dna region mediating increased thermotolerance at 58 degrees c in cronobacter sp. and other enterobacterial strains.
AB  == cronobacter spp. are opportunistic pathogens associated with serious infections in neonates. the increased stress tolerance, including thermoresistance, of some  cronobacter strains can promote their survival in production facilities and thus  raise the possibility of contamination of dried infant milk formula, which has been identified as a potential source of infection. in this study, we characterized a dna region which is present in some cronobacter strains and which contributes to their prolonged survival at 58 degrees c. the 18 kbp long region containing 22 open reading frames was sequenced in cronobacter sakazakii atcc 29544. the major feature of the region contained a cluster of conserved genes, most of them having significant homologies with bacterial proteins involved in some type of stress response, including heat, oxidation and acid stress. the same thermoresistance dna region was detected in strains belonging to the genera cronobacter, enterobacter, citrobacter and escherichia and its presence positively correlated with increased thermotolerance.

TI  == bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes from a greek vineyard.
AB  == grape bacterial microbiota plays central roles in the quality of grapes and wine, yet its diversity remains poorly described. in the present study, bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes of two cultivars originating from the same vineyard were assessed. isolates were identified by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and sequence analysis of partial 16s rrna gene. comparable counts were recorded between botrytis-infected  and sound grape samples. in all cases, the majority of isolates belonged to different species of enterobacteriaceae. the dominant species in the vineyard was klebsiella oxytoca that was found in different combinations with citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., erwinia sp., pantoea dispersa, tatumella ptyseos or  other species. in fermenting musts, those populations declined while other species evolved, like lactobacillus plantarum and enterobacter ludwigii. populations in botrytised samples persisted longer during spontaneous fermentations. present study suggests that bacterial diversity on grapes may be wider than previously described.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteria from the gut of bombyx mori that degrade cellulose, xylan, pectin and starch and their impact on digestion.
AB  == bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. it feeds on mulberry leaves. mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of b. mori, including the gram positive bacillus circulans and gram negative proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, serratia liquefaciens, enterobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, p. aeruginosa, aeromonas sp., and erwinia sp.. three of these isolates, p. vulgaris, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, p. fluorescens and erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and k. pneumoniae degraded starch. aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the cmcellulose and xylan. s. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including cmcellulose, xylan and pectin. b. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. the gut of b. mori has  an alkaline ph and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline ph. the number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.

TI  == phytoremediation of mercury in pristine and crude oil contaminated soils: contributions of rhizobacteria and their host plants to mercury removal.
AB  == the rhizospheric soils of three tested legume crops: broad beans (vicia faba), beans (phaseolus vulgaris) and pea (pisum sativum), and two nonlegume crops: cucumber (cucumis sativus) and tomato, (lycopersicon esculentum) contained considerable numbers (the magnitude of 10(5)g(-1) soil) of bacteria with the combined potential for hydrocarbon-utilization and mercury-resistance. sequencing of the 16s rrna coding genes of rhizobacteria associated with broad beans revealed that they were affiliated to citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, exiquobacterium aurantiacum, pseudomonas veronii, micrococcus luteus,  brevibacillus brevis, arthrobacter sp. and flavobacterium psychrophilum. these rhizobacteria were also diazotrophic, i.e. capable of n(2) fixation, which makes  them self-sufficient regarding their nitrogen nutrition and thus suitable remediation agents in nitrogen-poor soils, such as the oily desert soil. the crude oil attenuation potential of the individual rhizobacteria was inhibited by  hgcl(2), but about 50% or more of this potential was still maintained in the presence of up to 40 mgl(-1) hgcl(2). rhizobacteria-free plants removed amounts of mercury from the surrounding media almost equivalent to those removed by the rhizospheric bacterial consortia in the absence of the plants. it was concluded that both the collector plants and their rhizospheric bacterial consortia contributed equivalently to mercury removal from soil.

TI  == reconstruction of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from duganella sp. b2 in different heterologous hosts.
AB  == violacein is a bacteria-originated indolocarbazole pigment with potential applications due to its various bioactivities such as anti-tumor, antiviral, and  antifungal activities. however, stable mass production of this pigment is difficult due to its low productivities and the instability of wild-type violacein-producing strains. in order to establish a stable and efficient production system for violacein, the violacein synthesis pathway from a new species of duganella sp. b2 was reconstructed in different bacterial strains including escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes by using different vectors. the gene cluster that encodes five enzymes involved in the violacein biosynthetic pathway was first isolated from duganella sp. b2, and  three recombinant expression vectors were constructed using the t7 promoter or the alkane-responsive promoter palkb. our results showed that violacein could be  stably synthesized in e. coli, c. freundii, and e. aerogenes. interestingly, we found that there were great differences between the different recombinant strains, not only in the protein expression profiles pertaining to violacein biosynthesis but also in the productivity and composition of crude violacein. among the host strains tested, the crude violacein production by the recombinant  c. freundii strain reached 1.68 g l(-1) in shake flask cultures, which was 4-fold higher than the highest production previously reported in flask culture by other  groups. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficient production of violacein by genetically engineered strains.

TI  == origin and diversity of metabolically active gut bacteria from laboratory-bred larvae of manduca sexta (sphingidae, lepidoptera, insecta).
AB  == cultivation-independent analyses based on genetic profiling of partial bacterial  16s rrna genes by pcr-single-strand conformation polymorphism (pcr-sscp), reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr-sscp of the 16s rrna itself, and stable isotope probing (sip), followed by rt-pcr-sscp, were applied to characterize the diversity of metabolically active bacteria in the larval gut of manduca sexta bred on tobacco  leaves under greenhouse conditions. for sip, hatching larvae were fed with leaves from tobacco plants grown in a (13)co(2)-enriched atmosphere. dominant sscp bands were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. only one major gut colonizer, an enterococcus relative, was detected; it occurred in the heavy rna fraction, demonstrating its metabolic activity, and it originated from eggs, where its metabolic activity was also indicated by rrna-based sscp profiles. in contrast, a citrobacter sedlakii relative was detected on eggs by dna-sscp, but rrna-sscp and sip-rrna-sscp were negative, suggesting that these bacterial cells were inactive. a burkholderia relative was dominant and metabolically active on the tobacco leaves but inactive inside the gut, where it was also quantitatively reduced, as  suggested by lower band intensities in the dna-based sscp profiles. sip-rna-sscp  detected another metabolically active gut bacterium (enterobacter sp.) and more bacteria in the light rna fraction, indicating low or no metabolic activity of the latter inside the gut. we conclude that the larval gut supported only a low diversity of metabolically active bacteria.

(2) indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of sfc-2 cell-free  culture supernatant. the results showed that: sfc-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from sfc-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from  the culture of sfc-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease k.

TI  == carbohydrate and ethane release with erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum--induced necrosis.
AB  == erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum, also known as e. betavasculorum and pectobacterium betavasculorum, is a soil bacterium that has the capacity to cause root rot necrosis of sugarbeets. the qualitatively different pathogenicity exhibited by the virulent e. carotovora strain and two avirulent strains, a citrobacter sp. and an enterobacter cloacae, was examined using digital analysis  of photographic evidence of necrosis as well as for carbohydrate, ethane, and ethylene release compared with uninoculated potato tuber slices. visual scoring of necrosis was superior to digital analysis of photographs. the release of carbohydrates and ethane from potato tuber slices inoculated with the soft rot necrosis-causing erwinia was significantly greater than that of potato tuber slices that had not been inoculated or that had been inoculated with the nonpathogenic e. cloacae and citrobacter sp. strains. interestingly, ethylene production from potato slices left uninoculated or inoculated with the nonpathogenic citrobacter strain was 5- to 10-fold higher than with potato slices inoculated with the pathogenic erwinia strain. these findings suggest that (1) carbohydrate release might be a useful measure of the degree of pathogenesis, or  relative virulence; and that (2) bacterial suppression of ethylene formation may  be a critical step in root rot disease formation.

AB  == study objective: to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients with bacteremia caused by enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, or citrobacter freundii. design: retrospective cohort study. setting: 1300-bed tertiary academic medical center. patients: one hundred twenty-four patients who  had bloodstream infections caused by e. cloacae (3), e. aerogenes (71), or c. freundii (50) between 1998 and 2004. measurements and main results: data from patients with bloodstream infections caused by enterobacter sp or c. freundii were retrospectively segregated according to hospital survival (98 survivors, 26  nonsurvivors). multiple patient characteristics and processes of care were evaluated to identify factors contributing to in-hospital mortality. multiple logistic regression was performed based on univariate comparisons to determine independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. among the 124 cases of bacteremia, the crude in-hospital mortality rate was 21% (26 cases). univariate analysis revealed that survivors were more likely to receive an aminoglycoside as part of their empiric antimicrobial regimen (40% [39/98]) compared with nonsurvivors (19% [5/26], p=0.05). other factors related to antimicrobial therapy including choice and number of agents used did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors (p>0.05). vasopressor use (31% [30/98] vs 62% [16/26]), care in an intensive care unit (19% [19/98] vs 54% [14/26]), and acute renal failure (13% [13/98] vs 31% [8/26]) occurred more frequently in nonsurvivors (p<0.05). multiple logistic regression identified resistance to second- or third-generation cephalosporins (adjusted odds ratio [or] 5.16, 95% confidence interval [ci] 2.66-10.0, p=0.013), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance (adjusted or 5.44,  95% ci 2.53-11.7, p=0.027), and mechanical ventilation (adjusted or 12.2, 95% ci  5.99-24.5, p<0.001) as independent determinants of mortality. conclusion: among patients with enterobacter sp or c. freundii bloodstream infections, those with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant or second or third-generation cephalosporin-resistant strains or those who required mechanical ventilation had  an increased risk of mortality.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == confirmation of e. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  == paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. some are rich in wood  fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their  coliform microflora. therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. for the first series of analyses, the medium used was colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to  isolate bacteria in pure culture on macconkey agar. in a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase  activities, were used to isolate bacteria. first, the presence of thermotolerant  coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 mpn/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. from this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on macconkey medium and identified as citrobacter freundii, enterobacter sp, e. sakazakii, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, k. pneumoniae subsp.  ozaenae, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, pantoea sp, raoultella terrigena, r. planticola. second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 mpn/g (d.w) sludge, whereas e. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 mpn/g (d.w.) sludge. the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and e. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in  large quantities. also, indigenous e. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated e. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. in this second series of isolations, api20e and biolog identified most isolates as e. coli, but others remained unidentified. the sequences of the 16s rdna confirmed that most isolates were likely e. coli, few burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. this study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

TI  == temporal association of entomopathogenic nematodes (rhabditida: steinernematidae  and heterorhabditidae) and bacteria.
AB  == galleria mellonella l. larvae were infected with three species (seven strains) of steinernema spp. or three species (three strains) of heterorhabditis spp. infected larvae were incubated at 22, 27, and 32 degrees c. larvae were dorsally  dissected every 6h over a 48-h period. hemolymph was collected and streaked on tryptic soy agar plates. several non-symbiotic bacterial species were identified  from infected insect cadavers: enterobacter gergoviae, vibrio spp., pseudomonas fluorescens type c, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and serratia proteomaculans. at 18-24 h incubation, the nematode-associated symbiont occurred  almost exclusively. bacterial associates generally appeared outside the 18-24 h window. infective juveniles of steinernema feltiae (filipjev) (27), steinernema riobrave cabanillas, poinar, and raulston (oscar), or steinernema carpocapsae (weiser) (kapow) were left untreated, or surface sterilized using thimerosal, then pipetted under sterile conditions onto tryptic soy agar plates. several additional species of associated bacteria were identified using this method compared with the less extensive range of species isolated from infected g. mellonella. there was no difference in bacterial species identified from non-sterile or surface sterilized nematodes, suggesting that the bacteria identified originated from either inside the nematode or between second and third stage juvenile cuticles. infective juveniles of s. feltiae (cowles), s. carpocapsae (cowles), and h. bacteriophora poinar (cowles) were isolated from field samples. nematodes were surface-sterilized using sodium hypochlorite, mixed with g. mellonella hemolymph, and pipetted onto biolog bug (with blood) agar. only the relevant symbionts were isolated from the limited number of samples available. the nematodes were then cultured in the laboratory for 14 months (sub-cultured in g. mellonella 7-times). other enterobacteriaceae could then be isolated from the steinernematid nematodes including s. marcescens, salmonella sp., and e. gergoviae, indicating the ability of the nematodes to associate with  other bacteria in laboratory culture.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  == 'enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain salmonella serotypes, notably: salmonella typhi, a gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, salmonella paratyphi a, b and c. in addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". brucella sp., campylobacter sp., edwardsiella tarda, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia alcalifaciens, pseudomonas sp., serratia marcescens, francisella sp. and yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever this is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of citrobacter to be reported  presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in thailand.

TI  == microbiological quality of sous and tamarind, traditional drinks consumed in jordan.
AB  == this study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological quality of sous (a drink prepared by extracting dried roots of glycyrrhiza glabra) and tamarind (a drink prepared by infusing tamarindus indica dried pulp), traditional drinks consumed in jordan. twenty-one samples of sous and 44 samples of tamarind were collected from the local market in amman, jordan. water is the major component of the drinks. sous drink is characterized by having an alkaline ph (range, 6.6 to 9.9;  mean, 8.6), whereas tamarind drink has an acidic ph (range, 1.8 to 3.7; mean, 2.8). the drinks are not processed for safety before serving, and at some vendors drinks are not properly refrigerated. the mean counts for aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts in sous drink samples were 5.9, 5.0, and 3.8 log cfu/ml, respectively; those in tamarind drink samples were 4.0, <1, and 5.8 log cfu/ml, respectively. the lactic acid bacteria isolated were enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus buchneri. the yeast isolates in sous drink were from the genera candida, filobasidium, hanseniaspora, lodderomyces, pichia, and williopsis, and those in tamarind drink were from arthroascus, brettanomyces, candida, debaromyces, filobasidiella, hanseniaspora, klavispora, lodderomyces, pichia, saccharomycodes, trichosporon, and zygosaccharomyces. enterobacteriaceae were detected in two sous samples and were identified as enterobacter sakazakii and erwinia sp., and in two tamarind samples and were identified as citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae. salmonella was detected in one sous and one tamarind sample. pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in only one sous sample. these findings highlight the importance of application of hygienic practices throughout preparation and vending of drinks, starting with raw ingredients and continuing through preparation, storage, display, and serving.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase mediated resistance in urinary tract isolates of family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background & objectives: extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) hydrolyse expanded spectrum cephalosporins like ceftazidime, cefotaxime and monobactam aztreonam. esbl producing bacteria may not be detectable in the routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics and treatment failures. as information on esbl producers causing urinary tract infection (uti) is not available from our country, the occurrence of esbl producing strains causing uti was studied as also the differences between the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of esbl and non-esbl producers. methods: urinary isolates (233) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by stoke's method and esbl production by double disk diffusion method (ceftazidime and clavulanic acid). the clinical and demographic profile of the patients was noted. results: sixty two of the 233 isolates tested (26.6%) were esbl producers. approximately 38.5 per cent of klebsiellae, 24.7 per cent of escherichia coli, 24 per cent of enterobacter aerogenes, 33.3 per cent of proteus sp. and the only citrobacter strain produced esbl. recent surgery was found to be a significant (p < 0.01) risk factor for acquisition of esbls. approximately 30 per cent of the esbl producers appeared falsely sensitive or moderately sensitive to cefotaxime/ceftazidime in routine susceptibility testing. there was no difference between the esbl producers and non-producers in the susceptibility to non-beta lactam agents except for gentamicin. interpretation & conclusion: a high percentage of urinary tract isolates produced esbl. since they are likely to be missed in routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests, all microbiology laboratories should look for esbl production routinely to avoid treatment failures.

TI  == but-1: a new member in the chromosomal inducible class c beta-lactamases family from a clinical isolate of buttiauxella sp.
AB  == an atypical enterobacteriaceae strain with a beta-lactam susceptibility pattern of inducible cephalosporinase was isolated in tenon hospital (paris, france) from a patient's skull wound infection. identifications by the api-50che biochemical system and 16s rrna gene sequencing concluded that it was a member of the buttiauxella genus. the bla gene was cloned and sequenced. the deduced translated product was a 383-amino acid protein (but-1) with 75-78% identity with the chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli. the isoelectric point of 9.0 and the kinetic constants of but-1 were comparable with results described for other ambler class c enzymes. bla(but-1) and the associated ampr transcriptional regulator gene were divergently transcribed from a common intercistronic region,  a genetic organization already described for other inducible class c beta-lactamases. the deduced amino acid sequence of ampr shared 85% and 81% identity with ampr from e. cloacae and c. freundii respectively.

TI  == potential microbiological hazards in the production of refined paper products for food applications.
AB  == this study sought to investigate the significance of raw materials (starch-based  glues, raw material papers) at different microbiologically critical stages in the manufacturing process of refined paper products. the study examined the occurrence of microorganisms in the process and in end-product samples. microbiological surveys verified that the production and use of pasteurized starch-based glue was the most important factor threatening the process hygiene and product safety. subsequently, the production and use of starch-based glue was changed, and a follow-up programme targeting the microbiological quality of glue  was developed as part of a hygiene and safety management system. a total of 33 spore-forming bacterial and 15 enterobacterial isolates were ribotyped, and 22 and 10 different ribogroups (ribotypes), respectively, were generated. these isolates from starch-based glue, raw material paper and end products were atypical and, thus, in many cases physiological, chemotaxonomic (fame) and molecular (partial 16s rdna) results did not correspond. the most common spore-forming bacteria (55% of the isolates) were paenibacillus sp. and within this genus several new species were also proposed. the most common enterobacteria (87%) were enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii belonging to bacteria in hazard group 2, or species closely related to them. it was demonstrated that the  same spore-forming bacteria (ribotypes) were present in both the glue samples and the end products (45% of isolates). all riboprint patterns were saved at the vtt  identification library for future use.

TI  == characterization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in rendered animal products.
AB  == antibiotics are used in food animal production to treat diseases and also to improve performance. antibiotics are not used on all farms, and antibiotic resistance is occasionally found on farms that do not use antibiotics. rendered animal protein products are often included in poultry feeds and could potentially serve as a source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. one hundred sixty-five rendered animal protein products from cattle, poultry, and fish were aseptically  collected from poultry feed mills. fifty-five percent of the poultry meal samples had detectable levels of gram-negative bacteria ranging from 40 to 10,440 colony-forming units/g of sample. poultry meal and meat and bone meal had the greatest number of samples with bacteria resistant to five or more antibiotics. a high percentage of feed samples (85%) contained bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid, or cephalothin, whereas few samples contained bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. acinetobacter calcoaceticus, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter cloacae were the most commonly isolated antibiotic-resistant bacteria. isolation for salmonella was also performed, with 14% of the meat and bone meal samples containing salmonella sp. only one of the meat and bone meal isolates, salmonella livingstone, was resistant to five or more antibiotics. many of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria contained integrons, genetic elements that mediate multiple drug resistance.

TI  == detection and distribution of insertion sequence 1 (is1)-containing bacteria in the freshwater environment(1).
AB  == the distribution of insertion sequence 1 (is1)-containing bacteria was investigated in windermere (cumbria, uk), a freshwater body impacted by treated sewage discharge and run-off from the surrounding catchment. culturable is1-containing bacteria were recovered from the water column at three depths in windermere north basin (wnb) and south basin (wsb), and from sediment at both sites (at the sediment surface in wsb and to a depth of 12-13 cm in wnb). polymerase chain reaction amplification of is1 and the escherichia coli/shigella  sp. specific gene uida, from community dna from shallow sediments, extended the detection limit beyond that of culture at both sites. this detection was extended further into deep sediment extracted from wnb as is1 and uida were detected in sub-samples to a depth of 4.7 and 2.3 m, respectively. analysis of a representative subset of 90 is1-carrying isolates recovered from water and sediment at both sites demonstrated 21 heterogeneous is1 profiles with estimated  copy numbers ranging from 1 to 16. identification of the host bacteria showed that the element was confined mainly to enterobacter spp. however, this study showed is1 to be present in citrobacter freundii for the first time. plasmids were carried by 75.3% of enterobacterial isolates and four plasmids (2.6%) carried is1. dna sequence analysis of five is1 clones demonstrated that is1 isoforms from this study were similar (>89% nucleotide identity) to known is1 isoforms. two isoforms of is1 from a single enterobacter cloacae isolate differed by 6.7% at the nucleotide level suggesting that they had been acquired independently.

(34 samples), staphylococcus epidermis (22), yeasts (11), proteus sp. (11), pseudomonas sp. (11), klebsiella sp. (8), enterobacter sp. (6), citrobacter sp. (3), and acinetobacter sp. (1). the uropathogenic e. coli strains found were p-fimbriated, as demonstrated by hemoagglutination activity against human erythrocytes with and without mannose, sds-page of fimbrial proteins and transmission electron microscopy (tem). all e. coli strains found were exposed in vitro to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (1/8 mic). our results showed that: 1) p-fimbriated e. coli is the most prevalent microorganism in acute uti (34%); 2) exposure to sub-mics of ciprofloxacin inhibits fimbrial production  in 79% of e. coli strains; 3) the pattern of sds-page fimbrial proteins is modified after exposure; in particular, the most affected synthesis involves the  protein at 18 kd known as p-fimbriae.

AB  == the incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in ile-ife, nigeria. gram-positive organisms, specifically staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent  of the isolates. listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic  neonates. pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and escherichia coli from 7 per cent. other gram-negative bacilli cultured were enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), citrobacter freundii, salmonella sp., and proteus sp. (2 per cent each). the bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. the study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. it highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  == a genomic library of clostridium perfringens atcc 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the c. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. a positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb dna fragment insert was selected  and purified. lytic and lysogenic escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. the 3.8 kb dna fragment was amplified by pcr and found to hybridize with one band from c. perfringens dna digested with ecor1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. the fragment also hybridized with dna from other azoreductase-producing clostridium species, a eubacterium sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter amalonaticus and e. coli, but  not with dna from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. the data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of c. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in  others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == [in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpirome compared to other broad-spectrum beta-lactam drugs against 804 clinical isolates from 9 brazilian hospitals].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro activity of the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefpirome in comparison to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and imipenem in a multicenter study involving nine hospitals from six  cities (four states). material and method: a total of 804 isolates from patients  hospitalized in either intensive care units or oncology/hematology units was evaluated. the isolates were collected between june and november of 1995, i.e. before cefpirome became commercially available in brazil, and susceptibility tested by broth microdilution following the nccls procedures. all isolates resistant to cefpirome were retested by e-test. results: against enterobacteriaceae (n = 344), cefpirome demonstrated an activity 2 to 32-fold higher than that of the third-generation cephalosporins (tgcs) and similar to that of imipenem. the percentages of enterobacteriaceae susceptible were: 88%, 69% and 96% for cefpirome, tgcs and imipenem, respectively. the cefpirome spectrum was greater or equal than that of imipenem against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, morganella morganii and serratia marcescens. against acinetobacter sp. (n = 77), cefpirome was slightly more active than ceftazidime;  however, the percentages of isolates resistant to these compounds were high (84%  and 88%, respectively). the activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime and imipenem were very similar against p. aeruginosa isolates (n = 128), with mic50(mg/ml)/percent susceptible of 8/59%, 8/62% and 4/62% respectively. against  aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the cefpirome activity was 4 to 16-fold higher than that of tgcs but 2 to 8-fold lower than that of imipenem. conclusion: the results suggest that, in brazil, cefpirome has a spectrum of activity which is higher than that of the tgcs against aerobic gram-negative (enterobacteriaceae and non-enterobacteriaceae) and gram-positive bacteria and similar to that of imipenem against some enterobacteriaceae species and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

TI  == coliforms and salmonella in seawater near to domestic sewage sources in fortaleza (ceara, brazil).
AB  == the bacteriological conditions of the coastal region of fortaleza (ceara, brasil), including the coastal zones of the ceara and coco rivers, were examined. the study was conducted during june, september and december 1993, and march 1994. the region was divided into two areas: (i) direct influence area (dia), consisting of 20 sampling stations located near to discharge zones of the submarine pipeline system, where collections were carried out at the surface, and (ii) indirect influence area (iia), located near to the coastal zone, including barra do ceara, kartodromo, volta de jurema, mucuripe, farol and caca e pesca beaches, totalling 26 sampling stations. the most probable number (mpn) of both total and fecal coliforms in dia was positive only in station number 6, near to the sewage discharge exit. the following bacteria were identified: citrobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes and escherichia coli. kartodromo beach was contaminated throughout the sampling period. results of total fecal mpn was essentially lower than 3.0 x 10(2) coliforms/100 ml at caca e pesca beach. in december, at both dia and iia, salmonella was identified in several samples. in dia, the spatial distribution for salmonella suggests that there should be a coastal sea current from east to west along the coastline. in iia, salmonella was identified at kartodromo and farol beaches throughout the sampling period.

TI  == bacterial isolates from indigenous weaning foods in rural ethiopian setting, jimma zone, south west ethiopia.
AB  == a community based bacteriological study of weaning foods was conducted from november 1994 to august 1995 in six peasant associations, jimma zone. the households in the study community were found to be in poor sanitary conditions with cattle and pets living in the same room with humans, and the community gets  water from unprotected sources. the predominant weaning foods in the study community were cereals. these and other foods given to weaning age children were  found to be grossly contaminated, aerobic mesophilic bacterial counts being 10(5) cfu/ml of sample. the most frequent bacterial isolates were enterobacter sp, gram positive cocci including staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp.,  and escherichia coli in that order. various factors such as unsafe water, unhygienic handling of food, storage of food at ambient temperature for a long time, poor domestic and personal hygiene may have contributed for the gross contamination of weaning foods in the study community. this calls for educating the community on the relationship between contamination of weaning foods and diarrhoeal diseases, and promoting measures such as reheating of weaning foods which have been kept at ambient temperature for a long time before serving infants and children.

AB  == background: the new cephalosporins with heterocyclic positively charged substituent at position c3 belong to the 4th generation cephalosporins. it is not evident, whereas these antibiotics are effective against cefotaxime-ceftazidime-resistant bacteria. we investigated the efficiency of the  cefepime (maxipime, bms) against acinetobacter sp., x. maltophilia, pseudomonas sp., flavobacterium sp., sphingobacterium sp. and against strains with production of esbl (extended spectrum beta-lactamases) (enterobacter sp., citrobacter sp., klebsiella sp.). methods and results: we determined the susceptibility of the 54  strains resistant to 50 mg/l and more of ceftazidime. the majority of the strains (35) are susceptible to cefepime and mic is the range 1.65-3.15 mg/l of cefepime. 17 strains have mic = 6.25 mg/l. two strains (one strain p. aeruginosa a one strain k. pneumoniae) were resistant to cefepime and mic = 12.5 mg/l. the activity of beta-lactamases was determined by quantitative macroiodometric method in one strain of p. cepacia and two strains of sphingobacterium multivorum. they  hydrolyse actively imipenem (they produce metallo-beta-lactamase) and ceftazidime (they are highly resistant to this antibiotic), but cefepime is more slowly hydrolysed than ceftazidime. conclusions: at the present time cefepime is effective against ceftazidime-resistant strains in so-called "problematic" species of bacteria. however, it is important to protect its efficiency in the future, this requires its rational use.

AB  == bacterial cultures from 1801 human diarrhoeal faecal specimens were examined for  verocytotoxins i and ii by monoclonal antibody-based sandwich elisas. of the 68 elisa-positive cultures selected from initial screening, 32 were positive by elisa on repeat or from freshly grown cultures. elisa-positive pure cultures were obtained from 13 of these, of which seven were confirmed as verocytotoxin positive by cytotoxicity assay. these seven strains were typed as o26 (5) and o146 (2). the six false positive results were from isolates of enterobacter sp. (1), citrobacter freundii (1) and escherichia coli (4), one each of types o1, o18ac and o98 and an untypable strain. despite the occurrence of false positive reactions, sandwich elisa was a useful method for the rapid screening of samples, and detected verocytotoxin-positive e. coli strains, other than o157, from patients with clinical conditions in which they could be implicated.

TI  == [variation in transfer resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam in strains of acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp. and citrobacter sp. isolated from  the same university hospitals].
AB  == background: in the last decade were in sr documented new problems in resistance to the newer antibiotics that with regard to their structure and antibacterial properties resisted to the known mechanism of bacterial resistance. the emergence of multiple drug resistance to the new betalactams is connected both with frequent application of these drugs in the hospitals and transfer of r plasmids.  methods and results: we studied composition and transferability of resistance to  newer betalactam antibiotics in strains of acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp, and citrobacter sp. isolated during one month in patients from two teaching university hospitals. all strains studied were resistant to cefotaxime (ctx), ceftazidime (caz) and aztreonam (atm) but acinetobacter strains, although resistant also to caz and atm transferred the resistance to ctx only. thus, resistance to caz and atm has a chromosomal origin in these strains. a strain of  citrobacter sp., resistant to ctx, caz and atm, produced a esbl betalactamase detectable in a double-disk diffusion method (fig. 1). an enterobacter cloacae strain transfers directly the resistance to all new betalactams indicated. their  hydrolysis by these strains points to their production of new types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases esbl). conclusions: we strongly recommend to be strictly rational in the use of new betalactams of ctx, cza or atm type because it is suspected that, especially in so-called empirical prophylaxis or treatment, they exert a strong selective pressure toward the prevalence of mutants with transferable esbl-producing nosocomial bacteria resistant to these drugs.

TI  == phosphatase-mediated heavy metal accumulation by a citrobacter sp. and related enterobacteria.
AB  == a citrobacter sp. was reported previously to accumulate heavy metals as cell-bound heavy metal phosphates. metal uptake is mediated by the activity of a  periplasmic acid-type phosphatase that liberates inorganic phosphate to provide the precipitant ligand for heavy metals presented to the cells. amino acid sequencing of peptide fragments of the purified enzyme revealed significant homology to the phon product (acid phosphatase) of some other enterobacteria. these organisms, together with klebsiella pneumoniae, previously reported to produce acid phosphatase, were tested for their ability to remove uranium and lanthanum from challenge solutions supplemented with phosphatase substrate. the coupling of phosphate liberation to metal bioaccumulation was limited to the metal accumulating citrobacter sp.; therefore the participation of species-specific additional factors in metal bioaccumulation was suggested.

(30), methicillin susceptible s. aureus (36) and e. faecalis (34). the geometric means (gm) of mics ranged from 0.08 to 0.63 and % of resistance from 0.0 to 14.7. higher mics (gm from 1.02 to 2.67) were shown against citrobacter sp. (32), klebsiella sp. (27), e. coli (36), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (33), enterobacter sp. (32), proteus sp. (31) and methicillin-susceptible  coagulase negative staphylococci (34); resistant strains ranged from 18.7 to 41.2%. the in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (33) (72.7% of resistance to brodimoprim) was very low. regression  analysis, obtained correlating the results of mics with those of agar diffusion,  shows that the resistant strains have a diameter less than 11 mm, the intermediate ones a diameter of 11-13 mm and susceptible strains a diameter greater than 13 mm. the pae was determined using the abbott avantage system. strains were exposed to brodimoprim (1/4 x mic - 4 x mic range) for 2 or 6 h.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == multipoint identification of enterobacteriaceae: report of the british society for microbial technology collaborative study.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of multipoint identification schemes in a multicentre trial. methods: forty two strains of enterobacteriaceae  were distributed to 22 laboratories for identification by routine multipoint methods. analysis of results enabled inter- and intralaboratory reproducibility of a variety of tests, and the ability of laboratories to identify individual organisms to be determined. results: interlaboratory reproducibility of most of the biochemical tests was acceptable. the least reproducible tests, both within and between laboratories, were citrate utilisation, production of urease and beta galactosidase, detection of motility, and decarboxylation of lysine and ornithine. inconsistent results for these tests were often associated with misidentified strains. most laboratories performed identifications satisfactorily. most isolates (72.1%) were identified correctly to species level; 9.6% were incorrectly identified, and 6.4% could not be identified at all. the most difficult organisms to identify were citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei and aeromonas hydrophila. strains of enterobacter, serratia sp, and providencia sp were difficult to speciate. several laboratories could not identify organisms exhibiting at least one atypical biochemical reaction. conclusion: this study emphasises the need for quality control of media and reagents for multipoint identification of gram negative enteric bacilli.

TI  == resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in barbados.
AB  == resistance to third-generation, or extended-spectrum, cephalosporins caused by induction of class i beta-lactamases has been reported rarely from developing countries. seven isolates of cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative rods were recovered recently from urine, burns and ulcers in the queen elizabeth hospital,  barbados. the isolates were identified as acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), citrobacter freundii (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), morganella morganii (1), providencia stuartii (1) and proteus sp. (1). induction of beta-lactamase by cefoxitin was demonstrated, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution. beta-lactamases were demonstrated by isoelectric focusing; the presence of chromosomal beta-lactamases was confirmed in at least three of the resistant isolates. the only antibiotics which were uniformly active against these resistant strains were imipenem and ciprofloxacin. these data confirm the existence of resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins in barbados, and emphasise the necessity for continuous surveillance of resistance patterns in the caribbean region.

AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == mobilization of nonconjugative pbr322-derivative plasmids from laboratory strains of escherichia coli to bacteria isolated from seawater.
AB  == mobilization of derivatives of plasmids pbr322 and pbr325 was shown to occur between escherichia coli k12 strains in lb-broth at 37 degrees c, provided a mobilizer plasmid (f') was present either together with the nonconjugative plasmid or in a second donor strain. evidence from restriction endonuclease analysis suggested that the mobilization was facilitated by a transposition phenomenon involving the "gamma-delta" sequence of f'. it was shown that mobilization of a derivative of pbr325 from e. coli k12 to bacteria isolated from seawater occurred in incubations in both lb-broth and filtered seawater and that  pseudomonas sp., enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella oxytoca, e. coli, and citrobacter amalonaticus isolates were recipient-active.

TI  == epidemiological role of arthropods detectable in health facilities.
AB  == a total of 161 arthropod specimens were collected from 55 sites in a health care  facility during july and september 1990. of the 116 bacterial isolates obtained from their body surfaces 6% were from parasites (mosquitoes), 59% from eusynanthropic arthropods (tenebrionid beetles, flies, german cockroaches, wasps), 16% from hemisynanthropic arthropods (ants, spiders) and 19% from occasionally encountered insects (non-biting midges, moths, beetles). most (88%)  of the isolated bacteria were gram-negative rods of the species e. coli, enterobacter, klebsiella, citrobacter, proteus, serratia, pseudomonas and acinetobacter. gram-positive cocci accounted for 13% of isolates and were primarily represented by coagulase-negative staphylococci. the highest isolation  rates were from body surfaces of flies, german cockroaches, non-biting midges (chironomids) and tenebrionid beetles. about one third of all isolates were resistant to more than three antimicrobials using a standard disc diffusion assay. the presence of multiple resistance to antibiotics was observed in two thirds of enterobacter isolates, namely those of enterobacter cloacae from the body surface of germany cockroaches, in 13% of citrobacter spp and in 8% of klebsiella spp as well as acinetobacter calcoaceticus strains. strains of morganella and hafnia species were very infrequent but all of them shared resistance to the antibiotics tested. in contrast, strains of serratia spp were relatively antibiotic-sensitive. the group of isolated gram-positive organisms was represented by two strains of staphylococcus hominis and one strain of enterococcus sp, all of them were multiply-resistant to antimicrobials.

(1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a novel cephalosporin derivative, cp6162, possessing a dihydroxypyridone moiety at the c-3 side chain, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, with ceftazidime, aztreonam and cefoperazone as the reference  antibiotics. cp6162 showed weak or little activity against gram-positive bacteria, but potent activity against clinical isolates of the gram-negative species including strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, ps. cepacia, acinetobacter sp., xanthomonas maltophilia, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to the reference antibiotics. the mics of cp6162 were only slightly affected by the high producers of beta-lactamases except for cephalosporinase-producing c. freundii. it was, however, affected by the presence of ferric ion. cp6162 showed in-vivo activity paralleling the in-vitro activity, and also showed pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of ceftazidime in mice and rats.

TI  == cefotaxime and aminoglycoside treatment of meningitis caused by gram-negative enteric organisms.
AB  == we reviewed cases of gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at texas children's hospital from january, 1984, through june, 1989. seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. the etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were klebsiella sp, 9;  escherichia coli, 4; enterobacter cloacae, 3; citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2.  with the exception of one isolate of acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. in addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. children with meningitis caused by klebsiella sp. or non-klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). the mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the klebsiella and non-klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against  gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection.

TI  == hemolysin as a marker for serratia.
AB  == all serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. dna fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal dna of s. marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. kiliensis, s. grimesii, s. proteamaculans, s. plymutica, s. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. the restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. s. ficaria and s. marinorubra expressed  a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the s. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. the dna of the latter strains did not hybridize with the s. marcescens hemolysin dna probes. some s. marcescens strains, s. kiliensis and s. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. no hybridization was found with dna of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella arerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosus, listeria sp.,  aeromonas sp., legionella sp. and a meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin dna probes are specific for serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than serratia.

TI  == ticarcillin/clavulanate in the treatment of severe peritonitis.
AB  == a prospective study was performed on 50 consecutive patients with secondary peritonitis. all patients received ticarcillin/clavulanate 5.2 g three times daily as initial antibiotic therapy. in 30 patients a primary perforation was found in the gastro-intestinal tract and 20 had post-operative peritonitis. in two thirds of the patients a diffuse peritonitis was found which affected the whole abdomen. thirty-six patients underwent one or two laparotomies and 11 patients had more than three laparotomies. subsequently, 17 patients died. the cause of death was a therapeutic failure as a result of the surgical procedure in ten patients (nine patients with persisting intestinal fistulae, one patient with bleeding), whereas in seven cases antibiotic therapy failed. micro-organisms found in the latter patients were producers of type 1 beta-lactamase (pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter sp., citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens) and enterococci. ticarcillin/clavulanate is characterized by its broad antimicrobial  spectrum against anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and seems, therefore, to be well  suited for initial chemotherapy in patients with diffuse peritonitis.

AB  == antimicrobial agents susceptibility of 42, 940 strains of clinical isolates (from 1979 to 1986) were investigated and the data were analyzed on the basis of the sources of isolates; materials from in- and out-patients or from the different hospital units. bacteria studied were limited to the species of which isolates were 100 or more during 1979 to 1986. the following results were obtained. i) when the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates from the out-patient-materials were compared with that from the in-patient-materials, the following 13 bacterial species isolated from the former source were found to be more susceptible to antibiotics than that of the latter. these were s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, citrobacter sp., klebsiella sp., serratia sp., p. vulgaris, p. rettgeri, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa, p. putida, s. sonnei and salmonella sp.. ii) the frequency of isolation and their antibiotic susceptibility of s. aureus, enterobacter sp. and p. aeruginosa from both the in- and out-patients were comparable through 1979. however, s. aureus isolated from the in-patient-materials tended to show increased antibiotic resistance since 1983. this is probably due to the frequent use of the 3rd generation cephalosporins. iii) comparison of the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates from the different hospital units showed that the resistant strains were more frequently isolated in the materials from the urology unit and the susceptible strains were  more frequently isolated in the materials from the infectious diseases unit. iv)  antibiotic resistant s. aureus and p. aeruginosa increased abruptly since 1983 in the materials from the surgery and urology unit, respectively.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in vitro activity of tigemonam, a new oral monobactam, was studied with special attention to minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). against 250 clinical isolates, it inhibited 100% of escherichia sp., klebsiella sp., serratia sp., citrobacter sp., providencia sp., proteus sp., morganella sp., aeromonas sp., yersinia sp., shigella sp., and haemophilus sp. at 0.5 mg/l or less. with 1 mg/l, 75% of enterobacter sp. were inhibited; however, three of the 20 strains tested needed more than 16 mg/l. proteus sp., morganella sp. and providencia sp. were more susceptible, with mic90s of 0.06 mg/l or less. the mbc was equal to or two times  higher than the mic. increasing the inoculum size from 10(3) to 10(5) colony-forming units had little effect on mic and mbc; with an inoculum of 10(7)  or more, mic and mbc increase three to eight times. mic and mbc were a little lower in mueller-hinton base, and the presence of serum did not significantly change the mic or the mbc. tigemonam exhibits a rapid killing rate, but an increased antibiotic concentration was not accompanied by greater lethal effect,  and the lethal rate at mbc was lower in trypticase soy broth (tsb) + 40% serum than in tsb alone.

TI  == antibacterial activity of tigemonam dicholate (sq 30836) and interaction with beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == sq 30836 is an orally absorbed salt of tigemonam, a new monobactam similar to aztreonam in structure and microbiologic properties. when assayed against 400 clinical isolates, tigemonam's activity was similar to that of aztreonam and carumonam. it was highly effective against enterobacteriaceae but showed poor activity against gram-positive organisms. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella, shigella, yersinia, proteus, providencia, and morganella strains at 0.5 micrograms/ml or less, and all salmonella and hafnia strains at 1 micrograms/ml or less. citrobacter, enterobacter, and serratia strains were less  susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations [mic30] of 2, 32, and 8 micrograms/ml respectively). the activity of the new compound against enterobacteriaceae is comparable with and often higher than that of third-generation cephalosporins and oral comparison compounds. in contrast to aztreonam, tigemonam had minimal activity against pseudomonas sp and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria. data suggest that poor penetration through  the outer membranes of pseudomonas sp may be responsible for this failure. tigemonam was stable to hydrolysis by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the kl enzyme of klebsiella and by the proteus vulgaris beta-lactamase. also, measurement of the ic50 (concentration of inhibitor able to reduce the activity of the enzyme by 59%) showed that tigemonam has less affinity than aztreonam for class i cephalosporinases. however, only levels of beta-lactamase, not hydrolysis rates or affinity, correlated to mics of the two monobactams for the resistant enterobacter and citrobacter strains.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

AB  == inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation  of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the  kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == carumonam's in-vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria and its stability to their beta-lactamases.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the novel monobactam carumonam (ro17-2301) was evaluated on 311 gram-negative clinical isolates in comparison to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefotetan and ceftriaxone. carumonam showed an antibacterial potency equal to or higher than any other reference compound; in particular it was the most effective against proteus indole positive and klebsiella sp. its antipseudomonal activity was comparable to that of ceftazidime and it showed, together with aztreonam, the highest activity against the citrobacter, enterobacter and escherichia coli isolates. the minimal inhibitory concentrations performed on permeability altered organisms indicated that carumonam has a penetration rate comparable to aztreonam and higher than cefotetan and ceftriaxone. carumonam demonstrated excellent stability to chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and that correlated with its antibacterial activity against the producing strains and inoculum size effect.

TI  == occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance and r-plasmids in gram-negative bacteria isolated from faecally contaminated fresh-water streams in hong kong.
AB  == the bacterial populations of six freshwater streams in populated areas of the hong kong new territories were studied. there is considerable faecal contamination of these streams, with coliform counts as high as 10(5) c.f.u./ml and the contaminating organisms show a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance and multiple resistance. with direct plating of water samples onto antibiotic-containing media, an average of 49% of the gram-negative bacteria were ampicillin-resistant, 3% chloramphenicol-resistant and 1% gentamicin-resistant. at individual sites resistance to these drugs was as high as 98%, 8% and 3% respectively. more than 70% of strains were resistant to two or more antibiotics, 29% to five or more and 2% to eight or more. a total of 98 patterns of antibiotic resistance were detected with no one pattern predominating. twenty-eight gram-negative bacterial species were identified as stream contaminants. escherichia coli was the commonest bacterial species isolated and other frequent  isolates were enterobacter sp., klebsiella sp. and citrobacter sp., but no enteric pathogens were detected. the greatest prevalence of resistance and multiple resistance was associated with the heaviest contamination by e. coli. analysis of selected stream isolates revealed multiple plasmid bands arranged in  many different patterns, but multiple antibiotic resistances were shown to be commonly mediated by single transferable plasmids. faecally-contaminated freshwater streams in hong kong may be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance plasmids for clinically-important bacteria.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on cefminox].
AB  == laboratory and clinical studies were performed on cefminox (cmnx, mt-141), a new  cephamycin antibiotic, and results were as follows. antimicrobial activities. mics of cmnx against various clinical isolates were determined with the inoculum  size of 10(6) cells/ml. percentages of strains susceptible to 12.5 micrograms/ml  or less were 4% for s. aureus, 0% for e. faecalis, 100% for e. coli, 81% for k. pneumoniae, 3% for enterobacter sp., 18% for s. marcescens, 90% for p. mirabilis, 88% for indole-positive proteus sp. 100% for s. flexneri, 100% for salmonella sp., 0% for citrobacter sp. and 0% for p. aeruginosa. most of those sensitive strains were inhibited by 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. these activities were better than those of cefmetazole and cefazolin, but were not as good as those of cefoperazone. clinical efficacy three patients with pneumonia, 1 with pneumonia and sepsis, and 1 with urinary tract infection were treated with cmnx daily dose  of 1-4 g for 7-31 days. clinical responses were excellent in 1, good in 3, poor in 2 patients (contained a double case). bacteriological effects were good for e. coli, k. pneumoniae and s. liquefaciens, poor for p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. c. freundii, a. calcoaceticus and e. faecalis were cultured after treatment. no side effect and no abnormal change of laboratory findings were seen in our cases.

TI  == [effects of ks-r1 (ampicillin suppository) and ampicillin oral dosing on fecal flora of children].
AB  == a newly developed product, ks-r1 (a suppository containing 250 mg potency of ampicillin (abpc)), was given to 7 children (5 boys and 2 girls) ranging from 4 years and 5 months to 8 years and 10 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily  dose, 62.4 mg/kg) for 5 days. as a control, the same amount of abpc dry syrup was given orally to 7 children (4 boys and 3 girls) ranging from 2 years and 8 months to 7 years and 7 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily dose, 55.3 mg/kg) for 5 days. the effects of these 2 preparations on the bacterial flora of the feces were investigated, and concentrations of abpc in the feces and sensitivities of the isolated strains to abpc were determined. the results were as follows. as for gram-negative bacilli in the feces from children given ks-r1,  there was no change in escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. and enterobacter sp. which were isolated from many children 3 days after the end of treatment, but they did not show any constant pattern of change in mean number. other species did not show any pattern of increase in the number of children from whom they were isolated, or in the number of bacteria during the course after the beginning of treatment. the total number of bacteria identified as enterobacteriaceae was at the level of 10(8) cells/g on any day of examination. of gram-negative bacilli other than enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas sp. showed no constant pattern of change in number. on the other hand, of gram-positive bacteria, there was no constant pattern of change in the number of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci began to be isolated from many children  5 days after the beginning of treatment and were isolated from all children 5 days after the end of treatment, but there was no tendency for the mean number to increase. enterococcus sp. was not isolated from 3 children 3 days after the beginning of treatment, and was decreased in number by one order in 3 out of other 4 children as compared with before-treatment. however, this species was isolated from all children 3 days after the end of treatment, and the mean number of bacteria was similar to that before-treatment although the number of bacteria  was different in individual children.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (fos) was tested with mueller-hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms fos + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). for 3 411 strains, inhibition  zone diameters were recorded. almost all e. coli, citrobacter, salmonella and s.  aureus were susceptible to fos as well as 70% of serratia, e. cloacae, p. mirabilis and 50% of klebsiella and enterobacter sp. only 27% of p. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive proteus and 8% of acinetobacter were sensitive to fos. e.  coli, citrobacter and s. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to fos. sensitivity rates of e. cloacae, serratia, p. aeruginosa, and especially klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. this method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate g6p concentrations at this point of the disk.

TI  == [multicenter study of the antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin: cm 40874].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of cm were evaluated on 2 548 bacterial strains isolated in 8 hospitals. cm demonstrated high activity on enterobacteriaceae, the mic being less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 71% of the 1 362 strains tested, less than or equal to 1 for 99.6%, and less than or equal to 4 for 99.9%. mode mic varies little among the different groups of enterobacteriaceae (from 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms/ml), with the exception of serratia sp. (mode mic : 0.25) and klebsiella oxytoca (mode mic : 0.03). most of  enterobacter, serratia, and citrobacter sp. strains not inhibited by cefotaxime are readily inhibited by cm at the same concentrations than susceptible strains.  cm has less activity on p. aeruginosa (mic 2-32 micrograms/ml) and acinetobacter  sp. (mic 8-128). staphylococci (mic 32) and enterococci are not susceptible. variable activity is found against other streptococci. cm inhibits haemophilus sp. at mics of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml and gonococci at mics of 0.03 to 0.5 (whether the strains produce beta-lactamase or not). meningococci have a mode mic of 0.03 micrograms/ml (range 0.008 to 0.25). thus, cm 40874 is a new third generation cephalosporin with high activity on enterobacteriaceae, including those strains not susceptible to cefotaxime and good activity on haemophilus sp.  and neisseria sp. this additional activity is probably supported by enhanced resistance to enzymatic inactivation by beta-lactamases.

TI  == [pathogen distribution in waste water sprinkler irrigation].
AB  == the spray irrigation with pretreated wastewater was investigated on the sewage farm of the braunschweig sewage utilization association. the emission of airborne bacteria was measured by means of andersen sampler (as), reuter centrifugal sampler (rcs), and sedimentation plates (sp). there was a good correlation of results obtained by parallel measurings of as and rcs. the rcs was more effective by the factor 11.5 than the as sampling airborne microorganisms. however, the as  gaves the distribution curve of differently big airborne particulates (table 1).  the medium decrease of bacteria from the sprinkler determined by as and sp was similar (fig. 1). with low wind velocity, an aerosol containing enterobacteria was yet detectable at a distance of 60-160 m down-wind from the spray sprinkler.  the transport of bacteria as a function of the wind velocity is given in fig. 2 increasing about 25 m for an increase of the wind velocity of 1 m/sec. during the spray irrigation, the composition of bacteria in the airborne particles is varying continuously. the following order of succession of die-away rates was found: aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio greater than acinetobacter, pseudomonas greater than enterobacter greater than citrobacter greater than e. coli greater than klebsiella greater than gram-positive bacteria (table 3). only seldom and under extreme conditions, gram-negative bacteria were detected in a range between 200-300 m beyond of concentrations as they were found also in controls without irrigation. this result substantiates a minimum protective distance of 300 m between sprinkler and human settlements.

AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

AB  == the activity of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound, against 147 strains of microorganisms was studied and was compared with the activities of cinoxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin, and four beta-lactam antimicrobials. the minimal concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited by amifloxacin was lowest for escherichia coli and klebsiella sp (less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), followed by proteus sp (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml),  enterobacter sp and citrobacter sp (less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), providencia sp (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). when compared with the ranges of activity of seven  reference antimicrobials, the range of amifloxacin activity was lowest for p aeruginosa, citrobacter sp, proteus sp, and a calcoaceticus var anitratus and similar to aztreonam's activity against enterobacter sp. for amikacin-resistant p aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of amifloxacin ranged from 1 to 16 micrograms/ml. the mics and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of amifloxacin were similar. for all strains tested, microbial susceptibilities to amifloxacin were greater than those to currently available oral antimicrobial drugs, such as cinoxacin and trimethoprim.

TI  == efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. the majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. one hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. the clinical response rates, by organism, were: streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter sp, serratia sp, pseudomonas sp, klebsiella sp, citrobacter sp, and morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). in the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other us trials of the drug. the findings indicate that ceftizoxime,  1 to 2 gm bid, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract  infections in hospitalized patients. this low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.

AB  == the developmental dynamic of enterococci and coliforms was followed up in the entire technologic process and the storage of kashkaval (yellow cheese of ewe milk) under the conditions of modern industrial production. it was found that during the whole industrial cycle up to the steam cooking of curd the amount of enterococci grew and reached its peak value in the cheddarized cheese curd (2.4--30 million per gram), increasing from 10 to 34 times as against its level in the initial milk used. the coliform bacteria also rose in number, and their amount reached maximum values of 10 to 120 mill/g in the processed and dipped curd, after which a slowly advancing reduction set in. species of the enterobacter (55.1%), escherichia (14.1%), citrobacter (19.2%), and klebsiella (11.5%) genera were isolated. the steam cooking of cheddarized curd produced an unfavourable effect on enterococci (pasteurization effect of up to 98.3 to 99.9%) and a lethal effect on the coliforms. enterococci that resisted steaming multiplied in kashkaval and reached their highest level--960 000 up to 39 mill/g--between the 30th and the 60th day of production after which their numbers dropped. their amount in the ripened product varied from 95000 to 17.8 mill/g, and on the 240th following production--from below 100 to 1.6 mill/g. coliform bacteria were not found in 0.1 g of the product mass during ripening and storage  of kashkaval. out of the 196 strains that were differentiated as enterococci 30.7 per cent of the fecalis subgroup, and 69.3 per cent--of the sp. faecium-durans subgroup. after steaming 92.3 per cent of the strains were of the str. faecium and str. durans species.

AB  == the automicrobic system (ams) is capable of identifying most enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. all automicrobic system identifications with probability (p) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of morganella morganii, acinetobacter sp., yersinia spp., salmonella spp. (other than salmonella typhi), shigella spp. (other than shigella sonnei), enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas spp. (other than pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas maltophilia), klebsiella spp. (other than klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca), citrobacter amalonauticus, serratia liquefaciens, or vibrio spp. should be considered nonspecific responses, even when p greater than or equal to 0.80. other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. at least half of our isolates (60% of our enterobacteriaceae)  could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.

TI  == poly(adenylic acid) in small amounts, free or covalently linked to substrate, protects rna from hydrolysis by ribonuclease.
AB  == short lengths (18 residues) of poly(a), covalently linked to the 3'-termini of escherichia coli 5 s rrna, induce powerful inhibitions (38-87%) of the activities of rnaases (ribonucleases) from citrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., bovine pancreas, human spleen and human plasma. as the polypurine chain length is extended, enzyme activity declines. furthermore, poly(a) sequences, present only  on a small subpopulation of rna, and accounting for less than 1% of total rna, serve to protect all rna, polyadenylated or not, from enzyme-catalysed degradation. the quantity of 3'-terminal adenylic acid residues, relative to the  amount of substrate, determines enzyme activity. the exact distribution of a fixed amount of poly(a) residues on the 3'-termini of substrate molecules is unimportant in this respect. comparison of the efficacies of inhibition of rnaase activity, by using linked poly(a) and similar quantities of free poly(a), revealed that although the free polypurine inhibits rnaase activity, covalent linkage of poly(a) to rna is more advantageous to the stability of an rna substrate. however, the ratio of inhibited activities obtained by using linked or free poly(a) may change considerably with alterations in either substrate concentration or polyadenylic acid segment length.

AB  == the mrna for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the ecori and one of the hindiii restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total dna from nine bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae: e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes,  edwardsiella tarda, serratia marcescens, and erwinia amylovora. however, among the enterobacteriaceae, dna from two species of proteus (p. mirabilis and p. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized  with the e. coli lipoprotein mrna. furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in  four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp. ho1-n, caulobacter crescentus, and myxococcus xanthus. envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified e. coli free-form lipoprotein in the ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. both species of proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. all of the above four bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-e. coli lipoprotein serum. from these results, the rate of  evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that  observed for various soluble enzymes of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == combined activitiy of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin against ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (brl 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. ticarcillin mics were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. thirty-nine strains of enterobacteriaceae tested included escherichia coli (14), klebsiella pneumoniae (16), citrobacter sp. (3), enterobacter sp. (3), salmonella enteritidis (1), serratia marcescens (1), and proteus mirabilis (1). ticarcillin mics for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. against 33 strains (85%), the mics were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. in contrast, the mics for seven of eight strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (mic >/= 2,048 mug/ml) e. coli, k. pneumoniae, enterobacter, and p. mirabilis.

TI  == [in vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
AB  == in vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (ab-pc), carbenicillin (cb-pc), sulbenicillin (sb-pc) cephalothin (cet), cefazolin (cez) and gentamicin (gm). fifty three % of escherichia coli strains 53.3% of citrobacter sp., 80% of proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of morganella and 80% of bacteroides sp. were susceptible (mic being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to ab-pc. the eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. cb-pc  and sb-pc were almost as effective as ab-pc against escherichia coli and citrobacter sp. they were less active against klebsiella sp., but more active against enterobacter sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus group and pseudomonas sp. than ab-pc, sb-pc was more effective than cb-pc against pseudomonas sp. the strains of pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of cb-pc and sb-pc were pyocyanine-negative strains. all strains (100%) of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp. and citrobacter sp. were susceptible to cet and cez, while none of enterobacter sp. , serratia sp., proteus vulgaris.  morganella, rettgerella, providencia and pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. the mics of cet and cez against bacteroides sp. were moderately low. some strains of providencia and alkaligenes sp. were resistant of gm but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high mics against bacteroides sp. when seen from the mic distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).

TI  == susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  == the susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. the three strains of listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. there was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of salmonellae, citrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas sp. cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus sp., providence sp., flavobacter sp., herellea vaginicola, and mima polymorpha. cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against bacteroides sp. thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
