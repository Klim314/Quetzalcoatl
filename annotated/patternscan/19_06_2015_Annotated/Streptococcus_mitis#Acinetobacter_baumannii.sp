TI  == real-time comparative evaluation of biomerieux vitek ms versus bruker microflex ms, two matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry systems, for identification of clinically significant bacteria.
AB  == background: matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) recently became available for the identification of bacteria in routine diagnostic laboratories. it is rapid and cost-effective and likely to replace phenotypic identification. this study was undertaken to compare two maldi-tof ms-based, bruker microflex ms (bms) and vitek ms (vms) systems, for identification (id) of clinically significant bacterial isolates. clinically relevant broad diversity of bacterial isolates obtained during a 6-consecutive months of routine laboratory processing of clinical specimens were subjected to id by the bms and vms in parallel with vitek 2, a conventional phenotypic system  (cps). for the bms, the isolates were tested in duplicates directly and after pretreatment. identification was provided with accompanying scores according to manufacturers' instructions. with vms, single deposits of the same sets of isolates were tested in duplicates directly on maldi-plate. results were interpreted according to the manufacturer's protocols. discrepant results were resolved by 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing. results: a total of 806 pathogens comprising 507 gram-negative bacilli (gnb), 16 gram-negative cocci (gnc), 267 gram-positive cocci (gpc), and 16 gram-positive bacilli (gpb) were tested. bms and vms correctly identified isolates to genus and species levels (id 97.3% and 93.2%, and 99.8% and 99.0%, respectively). both systems as well as the  cps correctly identified the majority of the species in the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp., and acinetobacter baumannii. turnaround time for identification by bms and vms was <20 min compared with 24-48 h by the cps. conclusions: vms performed slightly better than bms with gpc id, especially  the streptococcus spp. some s. mitis isolates were identified as s. pneumoniae by bms. bms and vms were rapid and proved to be consistently accurate for producing  bacterial identification in a fraction of time it takes for identification by cps.

TI  == [etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia in children].
AB  == objective: to investigate the etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) in children. method: a retrospective hospital infection  study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from january 2005 to december 2008. result: six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as hap. the incidence of hap was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset hap and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset hap. the hap patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). the proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. there was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in icu, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. one hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. there were 30 (13.0%) gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%)  fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. the predominant bacterial pathogens were klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. the isolation rates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations  cephalosporins. the main pathogens of early-onset hap were respiratory syncytial  virus (rsv), streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset hap were esbls-positive klebsiella pneumonia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: hap in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. the main pathogens are gram-negative bacteria. rsv was an important pathogen of hap. the pathogens of early-onset hap are different from those of late-onset hap. these results may be of some help in prevention and control of hap in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice.
