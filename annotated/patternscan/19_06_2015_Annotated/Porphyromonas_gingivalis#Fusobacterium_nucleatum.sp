TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum alters atherosclerosis risk factors and enhances inflammatory markers with an atheroprotective immune response in apoenull mice.
AB  == the american heart association supports an association between periodontal disease (pd) and atherosclerotic vascular disease (asvd) but does not as of yet support a causal relationship. recently, we have shown that major periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola are causally associated with acceleration of aortic atherosclerosis in apoenull hyperlipidemic mice. the aim of this study was to determine if oral infection with another significant periodontal pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum can accelerate aortic inflammation and atherosclerosis in the aortic artery of apoenull mice. apoenull  mice (n = 23) were orally infected with f. nucleatum atcc 49256 and euthanized at 12 and 24 weeks. periodontal disease assessments including f. nucleatum oral colonization, gingival inflammation, immune response, intrabony defects, and alveolar bone resorption were evaluated. systemic organs were evaluated for infection, aortic sections were examined for atherosclerosis, and inflammatory markers were measured. chronic oral infection established f. nucleatum colonization in the oral cavity, induced significant humoral igg (p=0.0001) and igm (p=0.001) antibody response (12 and 24 weeks), and resulted in significant (p=0.0001) alveolar bone resorption and intrabony defects. f. nucleatum genomic dna was detected in systemic organs (heart, aorta, liver, kidney, lung) indicating bacteremia. aortic atherosclerotic plaque area was measured and showed a local inflammatory infiltrate revealed the presence of f4/80+ macrophages and cd3+ t cells. vascular inflammation was detected by enhanced systemic cytokines (cd30l, il-4, il-12), oxidized ldl and serum amyloid a, as well as altered serum  lipid profile (cholesterol, triglycerides, chylomicrons, vldl, ldl, hdl), in infected mice and altered aortic gene expression in infected mice. despite evidence for systemic infection in several organs and modulation of known atherosclerosis risk factors, aortic atherosclerotic lesions were significantly reduced after f. nucleatum infection suggesting a potential protective function for this member of the oral microbiota.

TI  == peripheral blood neutrophil cytokine hyper-reactivity in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == pro-inflammatory cytokine release (il-8, il-6, tnf-alpha, il-1beta) by peripheral blood neutrophils, isolated from periodontitis patients (before/after therapy) and matched controls, was determined after 18 h culture in the presence/absence of escherichia coli lps, opsonised staphylococcus aureus, heat-killed fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. all cultures demonstrated differences in the amounts of each cytokine detected (p < 0.0001), with a clear release pattern (il-8 > il-6 > tnf-alpha = il-1beta). median cytokine release from unstimulated patient neutrophils was consistently, but non-significantly, higher than from control cells. stimulated cytokine release from untreated patient neutrophils was also consistently higher than from control cells. this hyper-reactivity was significant for all tested cytokines when data for all stimuli were combined (p < 0.016). in terms of individual stimuli, significant hyper-reactivity was detected with lps (il-8), f. nucleatum (il-8, tnf-alpha), opsonised s. aureus (il-8, tnf-alpha, il-1beta) and p. gingivalis (il-8, il-1beta). cytokine production by patient neutrophils did not reduce following successful non-surgical periodontal therapy and, except for responses to f. nucleatum, the cytokine hyper-reactivity detected pre-therapy was retained. these data demonstrate that chronic periodontitis is characterised by neutrophils that  constitutively exhibit cytokine hyper-reactivity, the effects of which could modulate local and systemic inflammatory-immune responses and influence the risk  and severity of periodontitis-associated systemic inflammatory diseases.

TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == a clinical study evaluating changes in the microbial flora around dental implants during various stages of implant restoration.
AB  == purpose: this study evaluated the microbial colonization of dental implants in healthy patients before placing the implants and during the various stages of implant treatment. materials and methods: saliva (in completely edentulous patients) and gingival crevicular fluid samples (in partially edentulous patients) were collected from patients and analyzed to estimate the growth of microorganisms after culture. samples were collected during 10 phases of implant  placement and prosthesis insertion. sixty dental implants, 18 of nobelreplace select (nobel biocare) and 42 of gsiii/tsiii (osstem), were evaluated. the microbial titer was estimated in colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter. the percentage distribution of the organisms during the various phases was noted and  the average was compared. results: most prevalent microorganism found was gram-positive streptococci (3.59 x 10 cfu/ml). the titer of fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and pseudomonas being 0.42 x 10 cfu/ml, 0.15 x 10 cfu/ml, 0.09 x 10 cfu/ml, and 0.03 x 10 cfu/ml, respectively. the titer of these organisms noted during the experimental phase was low. a similarity was observed in the maximum colony-forming unit per milliliter between baseline and completion of implant therapy indicating establishment of equilibrium. conclusion: regular microbial evaluation along with clinical and radiographic monitoring could help in recognizing the potential for  periimplantitis and in prevention of the same.

TI  == real-time monitoring of the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == bacterial metabolic activity is associated with the onset and progression mechanisms of oral biofilm-mediated disease; however, at present no method to monitor bacterial metabolism exists, especially for periodontopathic bacteria. therefore, we aimed to establish a novel method for monitoring the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella  intermedia (pi) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), as well as streptococcus mutans (sm) for comparison. the method is based on the dye resazurin, which is converted to the fluorescent molecule resorufin by reducing molecules derived from bacterial metabolism. additionally, the effects of antimicrobial substances on bacterial metabolic activity were evaluated using this method. when bacterial suspensions were incubated with tryptone, glutamate, aspartate or glucose in the  presence of resazurin, the fluorescence intensity increased over time by these bacterial metabolic reactions, indicating that this method can be used to monitor the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria. chlorhexidine showed the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 15-49mug/ml for tryptone metabolism by pg, pi, and fn, and 7.1-18mug/ml for glucose metabolism by pi and sm. the ic50s for cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium dodecyl sulfate were 0.8-2.1 and 28-44mug/ml, respectively for all bacteria examined. fluoride had no effect except the ic50 of 640mug/ml for sm, while minocycline hydrochloride had no effect on any of the bacteria. the present study established the method for real-time monitoring of the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria, and the method might be useful for evaluating the effects of antimicrobial substances on the bacterial metabolic activity.

TI  == quantitation of biofilm and planktonic life forms of coexisting periodontal species.
AB  == background: complexity of oral polymicrobial communities has prompted a need for  developing in vitro models to study behavior of coexisting bacteria. little knowledge is available of in vitro co-growth of several periodontitis-associated  species without early colonizers of dental plaque. the aim: was to determine temporal changes in the quantities of six periodontal species in an in vitro biofilm model in comparison with parallel planktonic cultures. material and methods: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus and fusobacterium nucleatum were anaerobically grown as multispecies and monospecies biofilms and parallel planktonic cultures using cell culture plates and microfuge tubes, respectively. after incubating 2, 4, 6, 8 days, biofilms and planktonic cultures  were harvested, dna extracted and the target species quantified using qpcr with species-specific 16s rdna primers. biofilm growth as monocultures was visualized  at day 2 and 8 with confocal microscopy and crystal violet staining. results: the six species were found throughout the test period in all culture conditions, except that p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were not detected in multispecies planktonic cultures at day 8. in multispecies biofilm, p. gingivalis qpcr counts  (cells/ml) increased (p<0.05) from day 2-8 and were then higher (p<0.05) than those of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, whereas in monospecies biofilm,  p. gingivalis counts were lower (p<0.05) than those of the other species, except  a. actinomycetemcomitans. when multi- and monospecies biofilm cultures were compared, p. gingivalis counts were higher (p<0.05) but those of the other species, except p. intermedia, lower (p<0.05) in multispecies biofilm. comparison between planktonic and biofilm cultures showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  micra and c. rectus had higher (p<0.05) counts in planktonic cultures no matter whether grown in mono- or multispecies environment. conclusions: six periodontal  species were able to form multispecies biofilm up to 8 days in vitro without pioneer plaque bacteria. p. gingivalis seemed to prefer multispecies biofilm environment whereas p. micra and a. actinomycetemcomitans planktonic culture.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of subgingival microbiota in distinct periodontal conditions.
AB  == subgingival microorganisms are potentially associated with periodontal diseases.  however, changes in the subgingival microbiota during the progress of periodontal diseases are poorly understood. in this study, we analyzed bacterial communities  in the subgingival paper point samples from 32 korean individuals with no sign of disease, gingivitis, or periodontitis using 454 flx titanium pyrosequencing. a total of 256,113 reads representing 26 phyla, 433 genera, and 1,016 species were  detected. bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, synergistetes, and spirochaetes were the abundant phyla in periodontitis subjects, whereas firmicutes and proteobacteria were identified as the dominant phyla in the gingivitis and healthy subjects, respectively. although high levels of porphyromonas, fusobacterium, fretibacterium, rothia, filifactor, and treponema genera were observed in the periodontitis subjects, streptococcus, capnocytophaga, leptotrichia, and haemophilus genera were found at high frequency in the gingivitis subjects. species including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and fretibacterium fastidiosum were significantly increased in periodontitis subjects. on the other hand, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and leptotrichia hongkongensis were preferentially observed in the gingivitis subjects. intriguingly, the halophile halomonas hamiltonii was revealed as a predominant species in the healthy subjects. based on fast unifrac  analysis, distinctive bacterial clusters were classified for the healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis state. the current findings might be useful for understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == bacterial profile of aggressive periodontitis in morocco: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: aggressive periodontitis (agp) is one of the most severe forms of periodontal diseases. in morocco, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has been  strongly associated with agp, however limited knowledge is available about the implication of other periodontal pathogens in this entity. therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota in moroccan patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 50 aggressive, 13 localized and 37 generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 20 chronic periodontitis (chp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were  pooled in pre-reduced transport fluid and examined by culture. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more frequent (p = 0.004) in generalised  agp compared to chp, and porphyromonas gingivalis was less prevalent in localized agp, when compared with generalized agp (p = 0.040) or chp (p = 0.016). prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia were also frequently detected in all groups. mean proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in agp groups, when compared to chp, and generalized agp patients harbored significantly higher proportions of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, when compared to localized agp or chp. conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum were frequently detected in this moroccan population with agp. differences in frequency of detection, counts and proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. forsythia suggests the presence of distinct microbiological profiles for localized agp, generalized agp and chp patients.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == [features of adhesion of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria and candida albicans fungi to experimental samples of basis dental plastic depending on surface roughness and polishing method].
AB  == aim: study the main surface parameters of milled polyacrylic materials using atomic force microscopy and primary microbial adhesion of periodontopathogenic group bacteria and candida albicans fungi taking into consideration the method of sample polishing. materials and methods: studied samples: mill-treated without polishing (control); ergobox polished; polished in dental laboratory conditions;  polished by a rubber brush in dentists' office. microbial strains belonging to periodontopathogenic species (clinical isolates) that had been isolated from periodontal pockets of periodontitis patients: porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sanguis, c. albicans fungi were used for modelling experiments of primary adhesion of microbes to the material samples. results: s. sanguis had the highest degree of adhesion to polymer after milling,  p. gingivalis, c. albicans--medium, f. nucleatum--low. a significant reduction of adhesion is observed during polishing in dental laboratory conditions or ergobox, less significant--during polishing in dental office. conclusion: the data obtained allow to make a conclusion that the samples from polymer materials for preparation of prosthesis basis have varying degree of intensity of microbial adhesion of members of periodontopathogenic microflora and c. albicans fungi that depends on the polishing method, that accordingly determined the differences in colonization resistance against formation of microbial biofilm during polymer use in clinical conditions. . ,

TI  == abnormal pregnancy outcomes in mice using an induced periodontitis model and the  haematogenous migration of fusobacterium nucleatum sub-species to the murine placenta.
AB  == objectives: to investigate if there is subspecies specific migration to the placenta by fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and to determine whether experimentally  induced periodontitis results in adverse pregnancy outcomes (apo) in mice. methods: periodontitis was induced in pregnant mice using an inoculum of fn and porphyromonas gingivalis. in parallel, four sub-species of fn were individually injected into the circulatory system. at day 18 of gestation, the placenta, liver, spleen and blood were harvested and litter size, number of viable fetuses  and resorptions, maternal, fetal and placenta weights were recorded. for the direct inoculation group, some mice were allowed to deliver for assessment of length of gestation, litter size, maternal, placental and pup weight. the presence of fn was assessed by pcr and inflammatory mediators were measured by elisa or multiplex analysis. results: mice with alveolar bone loss, a marker of periodontitis, demonstrated significantly higher fetal weights (p = 0.015) and fetal/placental weight ratios (p = 0.030). pcr analysis of maternal organs did not identify fn in any extracted tissues. in mice that received direct injection  of fn subspecies, varying degrees of apo were observed including preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal loss. haematogenous spread of only fn  subsp. nucleatum to the placenta was confirmed. litter size was significantly smaller (p = 0.023) and the number of resorptions was higher in inoculated versus control groups. mice injected with subsp. nucleatum had significantly increased circulating crp levels (p = 0.020) compared to controls while the mice with induced periodontitis had increased levels of il-6 (p = 0.047) and il-8 (p = 0.105). conclusions: periodontitis in mice elevated fetal weight and the fetal weight/placental weight ratio. this study found that subsp. nucleatum migrated haematogenously to the placenta, leading to apo in mice. the study supports the potential role of fn in the association between periodontitis and apo.

TI  == the effect of blue light on periodontal biofilm growth in vitro.
AB  == we have previously shown that blue light eliminates the black-pigmented oral bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and prevotella melaninogenica. in the present study, the in vitro photosensitivity of the above black-pigmented microorganisms and four fusobacteria species (fusobacterium nucleatum ss. nucleatum, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, f. nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum) was investigated in pure cultures and human dental plaque suspensions. we also tested the hypothesis that phototargeting the above eight key periodontopathogens in plaque-derived biofilms in vitro would control growth within the dental biofilm environment. cultures of the eight bacteria were exposed to blue light at 455 nm  with power density of 80 mw/cm2 and energy fluence of 4.8 j/cm2. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis of bacteria was performed to demonstrate the presence and amounts of porphyrin molecules within microorganisms. suspensions of human dental plaque bacteria were also exposed once to blue light  at 455 nm with power density of 50 mw/cm2 and energy fluence of 12 j/cm2. microbial biofilms developed from the same plaque were exposed to 455 nm blue light at 50 mw/cm2 once daily for 4 min (12 j/cm2) over a period of 3 days (4 exposures) in order to investigate the cumulative action of phototherapy on the eight photosensitive pathogens as well as on biofilm growth. bacterial growth was evaluated using the colony-forming unit (cfu) assay. the selective phototargeting of pathogens was studied using whole genomic probes in the checkerboard dna-dna format. in cultures, all eight species showed significant growth reduction (p < 0.05). hplc demonstrated various porphyrin patterns and amounts of porphyrins in  bacteria. following phototherapy, the mean survival fractions were reduced by 28.5 and 48.2 % in plaque suspensions and biofilms, respectively, (p < 0.05). dna probe analysis showed significant reduction in relative abundances of the eight bacteria as a group in plaque suspensions and biofilms. the cumulative blue light treatment suppressed biofilm growth in vitro. this may introduce a new avenue of  prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == antibacterial photodynamic treatment of periodontopathogenic bacteria with indocyanine green and near-infrared laser light enhanced by trolox(tm).
AB  == background and objectives: it has been shown that certain vitamins can significantly enhance the effect of photodynamic anti-tumor therapy. unfortunately, there is no sufficient information available about the impact of those antioxidants on antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt). the present study is aimed at investigating the antimicrobial effect of the dye indocyanine green (icg) in the presence of trolox(tm) , a vitamin e analogue, upon irradiation with near-infrared (nir) laser light (808 nm) on the gramnegative periodontopathogenic bacteria aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.). methods: bacteria solved in pbs were incubated with icg (50-500 mug/ml) in the presence and absence of trolox(tm) (2 mm). irradiation was performed after 10 minutes of dark-incubation with nir-laser-light (25-100 j/cm(2) , 810 nm). during treatment, temperature was also recorded inside the bacterial solutions. the treated suspensions were serial diluted and plated onto blood agar plates. after anaerobe cultivation for 5 days the colony-forming units (cfu/ml) were determined. results: the antibacterial effect was icg-concentration and exposure dependent. it was found that high icg-concentrations and light fluence rates caused bacterial reduction due to hyperthermia. where low icg-concentrations (<250 mug/ml) and fluence rates only induced minor regression, additional trolox(tm) -administration significantly enhanced the photodynamic effect. while treatment of a.a. (250 mug/ml icg, 100 j/cm(2) ) without trolox(tm) caused no bacterial reduction, additional administration led to total eradication. in the presence of trolox(tm) reduction to one-fifth of the original icg-concentration (50 mug/ml) still induced total suppression of p.g. and f.n. at identical fluence (100 j/cm(2) ). treatment with icg, nir-light or trolox(tm) alone showed no remarkable bactericidal effect. application of high icg-concentrations (500 mug/ml) and exposure values (100 j/cm(2) ) caused peak temperatures of 64.53 degrees c. conclusions: the results clearly show that trolox(tm) significantly enhanced the  antibacterial effect of icg upon irradiation with nir-laser-light. additional administration of trolox(tm) may also increase the efficiency of other apdt systems.

TI  == dna methylation differentially regulates cytokine secretion in gingival epithelia in response to bacterial challenges.
AB  == epigenetic modifications are changes in gene expression without altering dna sequence. we previously reported that bacteria-specific innate immune responses are regulated by epigenetic modifications. our hypothesis is that dna methylation affects gingival cytokine secretion in response to bacterial stimulation. gingival epithelial cells (gecs) were treated with dnmt-1 inhibitors prior to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) or fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) exposure. protein secretion was assessed using elisa. gene expression was quantified using qrt-pcr. the ability of bacteria to invade inhibitor pretreated gecs was assessed utilizing flow cytometry. changes were compared to unstimulated gecs. gec upregulation of il-6 and cxcl1 by pg or fn stimulation was significantly diminished by inhibitor pretreatment. pg stimulated il-1alpha secretion and inhibitor pretreatment significantly enhanced this upregulation, while fn alone or with inhibitor pretreatment had no effect on il-1alpha expression. gec upregulation of human beta-definsin-2 in response to pg and fn exposure was enhanced following the inhibitor pretreatment. gec susceptibility to bacterial invasion was unaltered. these results suggest that dna methylation differentially affects gingival cytokine secretion in response to pg or fn. our data provide basis for better understanding of how epigenetic modifications, brought on by exposure to oral bacteria, will subsequently affect host susceptibility to oral diseases.

TI  == killing dental pathogens using antibacterial graphene oxide.
AB  == dental caries and periodontal diseases have a close relationship with microbes such as streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. graphene oxide (go), as the derivative of graphene, plays an important role in many areas including biology and medicine. in particular, it has been known as a promising antimicrobial nanomaterial. in this study, we focused on the antimicrobial property of go against dental pathogens. with the utilization of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) reduced test, colony forming units (cfu) counting, growth curve observation, live/dead fluorescent staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), we found go  nanosheets were highly effective in inhibiting the growth of dental pathogens. transmission electron microscopy (tem) images revealed that the cell wall and membrane of bacteria lost their integrity and the intracellular contents leaked out after they were treated by go. therefore, go nanosheets would be an effective antibacterial material against dental pathogens and the potential applications in dental care and therapy are promising.

TI  == bactericidal effect of visible light in the presence of erythrosine on porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum compared with diode laser, an in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: recently, photodynamic therapy (pdt) has been introduced as a new modality in oral bacterial decontamination. besides, the ability of laser irradiation in the presence of photosensitizing agent to lethal effect on oral bacteria is well documented. current research aims to evaluate the effect of photodynamic killing of visible blue light in the presence of plaque disclosing agent erythrosine as photosensitizer on porphyromonas gingivalis associated with  periodontal bone loss and fusobacterium nucleatum associated with soft tissue inflammation, comparing with the near-infrared diode laser. materials and methods: standard suspension of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were exposed to light emitting diode (led) (440-480 nm) used to photopolymerize composite resine  dental restoration in combination with erythrosine (22 microm) up to 5 minutes. bacterial sample were also exposed to a near-infrared diode laser (wavelength, 830 nm), using identical irradiation parameters for comparison. bacterial samples from each treatment groups (radiation-only group, erythrosine-only group and light or laser with erythrosine group) were subcultured onto the surface of agar  plates. survival of these bacteria was determined by counting the number of colony forming units (cfu) after incubation. results: exposure to visible blue light and diode laser in conjugation with erythrosine significantly reduced both  species examined viability, whereas erythrosine-treated samples exposed to visible light suggested a statically meaningful differences comparing to diode laser. in addition, bactericidal effect of visible light or diode laser alone on  p. gingivalis as black-pigmented bacteria possess endogenous porphyrins was noticeably. conclusion: our result suggested that visible blue light source in the presence of plaque disclosing agent erythrosine could can be consider as potential approach of pdt to kill the main gram-negative periodontal pathogens. from a clinical standpoint, this regimen could be established as an additional minimally invasive antibacterial treatment of plaque induced periodontal pathologies.

TI  == recovery of putative periodontal pathogens from curette sampling at different depths of periodontal lesions: an in vivo cross-sectional clinical study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the depth of curette sample collection from periodontal lesions on the recovery of putative periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: twenty-two periodontal pockets 6 to 8 mm deep with bleeding on probing at a single-rooted tooth were sampled, yielding 66 separate samples. curette samples were obtained at three different levels of the periodontal lesion (orifice, shallow--2 mm into the pocket; or base of lesion), and processed using pcr to identify 10 periodontal pathogens. the chi-square procedure was used to determine whether probe depth affected the distribution of bacterial counts observed. a repeated measures analysis of variance tested the hypotheses related to level of  probe and microorganism on mean rank of bacterial counts. results: the effect of  probe level on mean bacterial counts depends on the type of microorganism. likewise, the effect of microorganism type on mean bacterial counts significantly depends on probe level, where sampling from 2 mm into the periodontal pocket was  found to yield significantly higher results than sampling from the orifice. overall mean counts of pathogenic microorganisms were found to differ significantly across the three probe depths. the microorganisms differed in their observed levels over all three probe levels. further analysis found several significant differences that characterize the nature of the interaction between probe level and microorganism type. conclusion: there is significant difference in the amount of putative periodontal pathogens at varying depths of the pocket when sampled with a periodontal curette.

TI  == selected dietary (poly)phenols inhibit periodontal pathogen growth and biofilm formation.
AB  == periodontitis (pd) is a chronic infectious disease mediated by bacteria in the oral cavity. (poly)phenols (pps), ubiquitous in plant foods, possess antimicrobial activities and may be useful in the prevention and management of periodontitis. the objective of this study was to test the antibacterial effects  of selected pps on periodontal pathogens, on both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. selected pps (n = 48) were screened against streptococcus mitis (s. mitis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). the antibacterial potential of each compound was evaluated in terms  of planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (pmic) and planktonic minimum bactericidal concentration (pmbc) using standardized broth microdilution assays.  the most active pps were further tested for their effect on mono-species and multi-species biofilms using a colorimetric resazurin-based viability assay and scanning electron microscopy. of the 48 pps tested, 43 showed effective inhibition of planktonic growth of one or more test strains, of which curcumin was the most potent (pmic range = 7.8-62.5 mug ml(-1)), followed by pyrogallol (pmic range = 2.4-2500 mug ml(-1)), pyrocatechol (mic range = 4.9-312.5 mug ml(-1)) and quercetin (pmic range = 31.2-500 mug ml(-1)). at this concentration,  adhesion of curcumin and quercetin to the substrate also inhibited adhesion of s. mitis, and biofilm formation and maturation. while both curcumin and quercetin were able to alter architecture of mature multi-species biofilms, only curcumin-treated biofilms displayed a significantly reduced metabolic activity. overall, pps possess antibacterial activities against periodontopathic bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. further cellular and in vivo studies are necessary to confirm their beneficial activities and potential use in the prevention and or treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  == nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. all the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (control). all the interventions had a duration of 30 days. the dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. the supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). the total genome counts  from the control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). after 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis. other major periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels.  the toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts  in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == primate pulpal healing after exposure and theracal application.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this in vivo study was to compare the effectiveness of a new  light cured resin based dicalcium/tricalcium silicate pulp capping material (theracallc, bisco), pure portland cement, resin based calcium hydroxide or glass ionomer in the healing of bacterially contaminated primate pulps. study design: the experiment required four primates each having 12 teeth prepared with buccal penetrations into the pulpal tissues with an exposure of approximately 1.0 mm. the exposed pulps of the primate teeth were covered with cotton pellets soaked in a bacterial mixture consisting of microorganisms normally found in human pulpal abscesses. after removal of the pellet, hemostasis was obtained and the pulp capping agents applied. the light cured resin based pulp capping material (theracal lc) was applied to the pulpal tissue of twelve teeth with a needle tip  syringe and light cured for 15 seconds. pure portland cement mixed with a 2% chlorhexidine solution was placed on the exposed pulpal tissues of another twelve teeth. twelve additional teeth had a base of gic applied (triage, fuji vii gc america) and another twelve had a pulp cap with vlc dycal (dentsply), a light cured calcium hydroxide resin based material. the pulp capping bases were then covered with a rmgi (fuji ii lc gc america). the tissue samples were collected at 4 weeks. the samples were deminerilized, sectioned, stained and histologically graded. results: there were no statistically significant differences between the  groups in regard to pulpal inflammation (h = 0.679, p = 1.00). however, both the  portland cement and light cured theracal lc groups had significantly more frequent hard tissue bridge formation at 28 days than the gic and vlc dycal groups (h = 11.989, p = 0.009). the measured thickness of the hard tissue bridges with the pure portland and light cured theracal lc groups were statistically greater than that of the other two groups (h = 15.849, p = 0.002). in addition, the occurrence of pulpal necrosis was greater with the gic group than the others. four premolars, one each treated according to the protocols were analyzed with a  microct machine. the premolar treated with the light cured theracal lc demonstrated a complete hard tissue bridge. the premolar treated with the gic did not show a complete hard tissue bridge while the premolar treated with vlc dycal  had an incomplete bridge. the pure portland with chlorhexidine mixture created extensive hard tissue bridging. conclusion: theracal lc applied to primate pulps  created dentin bridges and mild inflammation acceptable for pulp capping.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == n-acetylcysteine and the human serum components that inhibit bacterial invasion of gingival epithelial cells prevent experimental periodontitis in mice.
AB  == purpose: we previously reported that human serum significantly reduces the invasion of various oral bacterial species into gingival epithelial cells in vitro. the aims of the present study were to characterize the serum component(s)  responsible for the inhibition of bacterial invasion of epithelial cells and to examine their effect on periodontitis induced in mice. methods: immortalized human gingival epithelial (hok-16b) cells were infected with various 5- (and 6-)  carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-labeled oral bacteria, including fusobacterium nucleatum, provetella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponiema denticola, in the absence or presence of three major serum components  (human serum albumin [hsa], pooled human igg [phigg] and alpha1-antitrypsin). bacterial adhesion and invasion were determined by flow cytometry. the levels of  intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros) and activation of small gtpases were  examined. experimental periodontitis was induced by oral inoculation of p. gingivalis and t. denticola in balb/c mice. results: hsa and phigg, but not alpha1-antitrypsin, efficiently inhibited the invasion of various oral bacterial  species into hok-16b cells. hsa but not phigg decreased the adhesion of f. nucleatum onto host cells and the levels of intracellular ros in hok-16b cells. n-acetylcysteine (nac), a ros scavenger, decreased both the levels of intracellular ros and invasion of f. nucleatum into hok-16b cells, confirming the role of ros in bacterial invasion. infection with f. nucleatum activated rac1, a  regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. not only hsa and nac but also phigg decreased the f. nucleatum-induced activation of rac1. furthermore, both hsa plus phigg and nac significantly reduced the alveolar bone loss in the experimental periodontitis induced by p. gingivalis and t. denticola in mice. conclusions: nac and the serum components hsa and phigg, which inhibit bacterial invasion of oral  epithelial cells in vitro, can successfully prevent experimental periodontitis.

TI  == fap2 of fusobacterium nucleatum is a galactose-inhibitable adhesin involved in coaggregation, cell adhesion, and preterm birth.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is a common oral anaerobe involved in periodontitis that  is known to translocate and cause intrauterine infections. in the oral environment, f. nucleatum adheres to a large diversity of species, facilitating their colonization and creating biological bridges that stabilize the multispecies dental biofilm. many of these interactions (called coadherences or coaggregations) are galactose sensitive. galactose-sensitive interactions are also involved in the binding of f. nucleatum to host cells. hemagglutination of some f. nucleatum strains is also galactose sensitive, suggesting that a single galactose-sensitive adhesin might mediate the interaction of fusobacteria with many partners and targets. in order to identify the fusobacterial galactose-sensitive adhesin, a system for transposon mutagenesis in fusobacteria  was created. the mutant library was screened for hemagglutination deficiency, and three clones were isolated. all three clones were found to harbor the transposon  in the gene coding for the fap2 outer membrane autotransporter. the three fap2 mutants failed to show galactose-inhibitable coaggregation with porphyromonas gingivalis and were defective in cell binding. a fap2 mutant also showed a 2-log  reduction in murine placental colonization compared to that of the wild type. our results suggest that fap2 is a galactose-sensitive hemagglutinin and adhesin that is likely to play a role in the virulence of fusobacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of pgla-am1, cpf-am1, and magainin-am1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (hdps). three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla-am1), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf-am1) and magainin-am1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the african volcano frog xenopus amieti (pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. minimal effective concentrations (mecs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined by microbroth dilution. pgla-am1 and cpf-am1 were particularly active against streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against fusobacterium  nucleatum, whereas enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. a type strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. pgla-am1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. all three peptides  showed less binding to p. gingivalis lps than to lps from the other species studied. oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 mum peptide treatments. production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 mum magainin-am1 but not following treatment with pgla-am1 or cpf-am1. in conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the x. amieti peptides bound to lps from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. cpf-am1 and pgla-am1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.

TI  == regulation of adrenomedullin and nitric oxide production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: in periodontitis the host response to bacterial challenge includes activity of the multifunctional molecules adrenomedullin (am) and nitric oxide (no). the aim of this study was to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria in regulating the production of these molecules from cultured cells. material and methods: regulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes when challenged with culture supernatants from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, veillonella atypica, streptococcus salivarius and candida  albicans was examined. am and no were measured in cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitrate/nitrite (no metabolites) griess assay respectively. cellular production of am and inducible no synthase was also analysed in target cells by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. the inter-relationship of am and no production were further investigated with macrophages. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus induced maximal levels of both am and no after 6 and 48 h respectively from oral  keratinocytes. am production in macrophages was upregulated in response to the no donor s-nitrosoglutathione and partially blocked by the inducible no synthase inhibitor, nomega -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. likewise, no production was increased upon exposure to am, while the am receptor antagonist am 22-52 reduced the release of no. conclusions: pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, were more effective than those associated with chronic periodontitis, p. gingivalis and prev. intermedia, and commensals, s. salivarius and v. atypica, as regards the upregulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes. interaction between these molecules was also demonstrated with macrophages. understanding the coordinated regulation of am and no production in response to periodontal bacteria may identify ways to promote their protective effects and minimize destructive potential.

TI  == shifts in campylobacter species abundance may reflect general microbial community shifts in periodontitis progression.
AB  == background: oral campylobacter species have been found to be associated with periodontitis progression. while the etiological significance of campylobacter rectus is quite established, the association of c. gracilis, c. concisus, and c.  curvus with health or disease remains contradictory. objectives: this study hypothesizes that the proportion of species within the campylobacter genus rather than the absolute abundance of a single species is a suitable indicator for periodontitis progression. design: subgingival plaque from 90 periodontitis patients and gingival sulcus fluid of 32 healthy individuals were subjected to a  newly developed nested pcr approach, in which all campylobacter spp. were amplified simultaneously. the resulting mixture of 16s-rrna-gene-amplicons were separated by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (sscp) gel electrophoresis, followed by sequencing and identification of excised bands and relative quantification of band intensities. in all samples, the abundance of selected periodontitis marker species was determined based on dna hybridization on a microarray. results: the highly prevalent campylobacter community was composed of varying proportions of c. rectus, c. gracilis, c. concisus, and c. curvus. cluster analysis based on sscp-banding pattern resulted in distinct groups which in turn coincided with significant differences in abundance of established periodontitis marker species (tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum) and progression. conclusions: the shift  in the campylobacter community composition seems to display the general microbial community shift during clinical progression in a simplified manner. the focus on  members of the campylobacter in this study suggests that this genus can be an indicator of ecological changes in the subgingival oral microflora.

AB  == objective: to compare the prevalence and levels of six bacterial pathogens within the subgingival/submucosal microbiota at teeth versus implants with various clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty-two chinese were included. four subgingival/submucosal sites were selected for microbiological sampling within each subject, that is, (1) healthy peri-implant tissues; (2) peri-implantitis [ppd >/= 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (bop) and confirmed radiographic bone loss]; (3) healthy gingiva; and (4) periodontitis (ppd >/=4 mm). subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr) was used to quantify six pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), treponema denticola (t.d.), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), and staphylococcus aureus (s.a.). counts were log10-transformed. results: the most commonly detected species were s. a. and f.  n., while a. a. and. p. i. had the lowest detection frequency. the detection frequencies of diseased tooth or implant sites for each of the six target species were either equal to or higher than the respective frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. there were no statistically significant differences  for any of the species or clinical sites (p > 0.05, cochran's q test). no statistically significant differences in the bacterial loads were found among the four clinical sites; with the exception of f. nucleatum. this was more abundant in periodontitis sites (p = 0.023, friedman's 2-way anova). both periodontal and  peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbor  s. aureus cells. the log10-transformed loads of s. aureus were approximately 3.5  within each of the clinical sites (p = 0.232). this was the highest of the six species analyzed. conclusions: within the same subjects, putative periodontal pathogens were common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites irrespective of  health status. the prevalence and levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were significantly associated with periodontitis, but not with peri-implantitis. a. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with both disease conditions, periodontitis  and peri-implantitis, but not with either gingival or mucosal health.

TI  == prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in subgingival samples of italian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in 352 italian patients with chronic periodontitis. possible correlations with clinical parameters, age, gender and smoking status were also investigated. at first visit a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained for each subject by using the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analysed according to a commercially available quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (meridol(r) perio diagnostics, gaba international, switzerland). porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were investigated.  fn resulted the most frequently detected (95%) while tf showed the highest load (12x105 cells/plaque sample). aa was the less represented bacteria for load and presence. bacterial load of pg, td, tf and fn showed a direct correlation to bleeding on probing (bop) and presence of suppuration (p=0.0001). the bacterial load was always directly correlated to probing pocket depth (ppd) (p=0.0001). among the investigated variables, ppd resulted the most important risk indicator  for periodontal pathogens. bop appeared as a risk indicator for td, tf, pg detection. few studies have described the microbiological pattern of chronic periodontal disease in the italian population. considering the different forms of periodontitis, similar investigations in other countries are needed to disclose any microbiological differences among populations, which may lead to more specific approaches to prevention and therapy.

TI  == essential oils and isolated compounds from lippia alba leaves and flowers: antimicrobial activity and osteoclast apoptosis.
AB  == in the present study, essential oils extracted from the leaves and flowers of lippia alba (mill.) n.e.br. (l. alba) were analyzed for their antimicrobial activity and their effects on osteoclasts. the periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans; atcc 43717), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum; atcc 25586) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis); atcc 33277) were used in antimicrobial activity assays for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), whereas bacteroides fragilis (b. fragilis; atcc 25285) was used as the control microorganism. osteoclast (oc) apoptosis was assessed by tunel assay and fas receptor expression was detected by immunocytochemistry. the analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that p. gingivalis had the lowest mic values, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans had the highest. l. alba essential oils were found to be toxic to human cells, although the compounds, carvone, limonene and citral, were non-toxic and induced apoptosis in the ocs. this study demonstrates that l. alba has potential biotechnological application in dentistry. in fact periodontal disease has a multifactorial etiology, and the immune response to microbial challenge leads to osteoclast activation and the resorption of the alveolar bone, resulting in tooth loss.

TI  == interactions of anaerobic bacteria with dental stem cells: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: in patients with periodontitis, it is highly likely that local (progenitor) cells encounter pathogenic bacteria. the purpose of this in vitro study was to elucidate how human dental follicle stem cells (hdfsc) react towards a direct challenge with anaerobic periodontal pathogens under their natural oxygen-free atmosphere. hdfsc were compared to human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hbmsc) and differentiated primary human gingival fibroblasts (hgif), as well as permanent gingival carcinoma cells (ca9-22). methodology/principal findings: the different cell types were investigated in a co-culture system with  porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) and fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum). the viability of the cells and pathogens under anaerobic conditions,  as well as interactions in terms of adherence and internalization, were examined. additionally, the release of pro-inflammatory interleukin-8 (il-8) and anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (il-10) was quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the bacteria adhered less efficiently to hdfsc compared to ca9-22 (p. gingivalis: 0.18% adherence to hdfsc; 3.1% adherence to ca9-22). similar results were observed for host cell internalization (f. nucleatum: 0.002% internalization into hdfsc; 0.09% internalization into ca9-22). statistically significantly less il-8 was secreted from hdfsc after stimulation with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis in comparison with hgif (f. nucleatum: 2080.0 pg/ml--hgif; 19.7 pg/ml--hdfsc). the il-10 response of the differentiated cells was found to be low in relation to their pro-inflammatory il-8 response. conclusions/significance: the results indicate that dental stem cells are less prone to interactions with pathogenic bacteria than differentiated cells in an anaerobic environment. moreover, during bacterial challenge, the stem cell immune response seems to be more towards an anti-inflammatory reaction. for a potential  future therapeutic use of hdfsc, these findings support the idea of a save application.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma and other plasma preparations against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: in addition to releasing a pool of growth factors during activation,  platelets have many features that indicate their role in the anti-infective host  defense. the antimicrobial activities of platelet-rich plasma (prp) and related plasma preparations against periodontal disease-associated bacteria were evaluated. methods: four distinct plasma fractions were extracted in the formulation used commonly in dentistry and were tested for their antibacterial properties against three periodontal bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the minimum inhibitory concentration of each plasma preparation was determined, and in vitro  time-kill assays were used to detect their abilities to inhibit bacterial growth. bacterial adhesion interference and the susceptibility of bacterial adherence by  these plasma preparations were also conducted. results: all plasma preparations can inhibit bacterial growth, with prp showing the superior activity. bacterial growth inhibition by prp occurred in the first 24 hours after application in the  time-kill assay. prp interfered with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans attachment and enhanced exfoliation of attached p. gingivalis but had no influences on f. nucleatum bacterial adherence. conclusions: prp expressed antibacterial properties, which may be attributed to platelets possessing additional antimicrobial molecules. the application of prp on periodontal surgical sites is advisable because of its regenerative potential and its antibacterial effects.

TI  == effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on short chain fatty acid levels in  gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: short chain fatty acids (scfas) play important roles in periodontal diseases. however, the concentrations of scfas in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with aggressive periodontitis are not known. the aim of this intervention study was to investigate the influences of non-surgical periodontal  therapy on levels of scfas in the gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (g-agp), and analyze the concentrations of scfas in sites with or without the detected putative periodontal pathogens. material and methods: eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected on filter paper strips from patients with g-agp (n = 20; mean age  24.5 years), before and at 2 wk, 2, 4 and 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal treatment. eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected from periodontally healthy controls (n = 20; mean age 26.2 years). concentrations of formic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and isovaleric acid from the supernatant of gingival crevicular fluid samples were measured by high performance capillary electrophoresis. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum from the precipitate of the same pretreatment samples of gingival crevicular fluids were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. results: the clinical parameters of patients with g-agp during the 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal  treatment were improved remarkably. the formic acid concentration increased significantly after treatment; the level of formic acid was lower in the p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with the negative sites. the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid reduced significantly after treatment and reached the lowest level at 2 wk post-treatment, although showed a tendency to increase after 2 mo post-treatment, and the three scfa levels were significantly higher in p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with those in the negative sites. conclusion: non-surgical periodontal treatment resulted in a significant decrease of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid levels and increase of formic acid level in gingival crevicular fluids in patients with g-agp, accompanied by improvement in clinical parameters. a marked lower level of formic acid, as well as higher levels of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with g-agp was consistent with periodontal pathogen infection.

TI  == [effects of cetylpyridinium chloride buccal tablets on halitosis induced by oral  conditions].
AB  == objective: to investigate the effect of cetylpyridinium chloride buccal tablets on halitosis induced by oral conditions. methods: with porphyromonas gingivalis,  prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum as the testing bacteria, the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of cetylpyridinium chloride buccal tablets was determined using minute amount serial dilution test. the production of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) was measured using sulfide detector halimeter in the anaerobic bacteria culture at 4 and 8 h after addition of the tablets. the effect of the tablets in suppressing odor production by mouth-borne halitosis bacteria was assessed using cysteine challenge test in healthy volunteers, and the effectiveness was evaluated by measuring the reduction in vscs production and the duration of the effect. results: cetylpyridinium chloride buccal tablets inhibited the growth of all the 3 bacteria. the tablets obviously inhibited vscs  production by the 3 bacteria with a effect similar to chlorhexidine. compared with distilled water gargle, the buccal tablets significantly reduced cysteine-induced vscs production level in the healthy volunteers (p<0.05), and the effect lasted for 230 min. conclusion: cetylpyridinium chloride tablets can obviously suppress bacteria responsible for oral halitosis and produce good effects in the treatment of halitosis induced by oral conditions.

TI  == effect of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus hd100 on multispecies oral communities.
AB  == the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on different periodontal pathogens has already been described. however, it is necessary to consider the polymicrobial nature of periodontal disease. the current study explores the predation of bdellovibrio on oral pathogens organized in multispecies communities. the effect of the predator was evaluated on in vitro six species communities with microbial culturing. additionally, the effect on ex vivo subgingival plaque and saliva samples from periodontitis patients was assessed. in the latter experiment results were examined with microbial culturing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the latter technique was used to get an overview of the whole mixed microbial population. results showed that even in more complex models, b. bacteriovorus was still able to predate on fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. however predation on prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis could not be validated in multispecies models. the effect of bdellovibrio was not restricted to the target bacteria. changes in the  overall ecology of the different models were evident. it could be concluded that  the efficiency of predation decreased when complexity of the models increased. however, b. bacteriovorus was able to attack two important oral pathogens, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, even when present in ex vivo clinical samples. these effects still have to be validated in in vivo models to see the impact of bdellovibrio on the whole bacterial ecology.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == real-time pcr quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva samples from  healthy young adults.
AB  == objective: the use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid for the evaluation of periodontal health has gained attention recently. most published real-time pcr assays focused on quantification of bacteria in subgingival plaque, not in saliva. the aims of this study were to develop a real-time pcr assay for quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva and to establish a relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and colony-forming unit (cfu). materials and methods: taqman primers/probe sets were used for the detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), and total bacteria. six periodontal pathogens and total bacteria in saliva from 24 periodontally healthy individuals  were determined. the relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and cfu was established by measuring the concentrations of extracted bacterial dna and cfu per milliliter of bacteria on agar plates. results: fn, ec, and pi were detected  in all saliva samples, while 58.5, 45.8, and 33.3% were detected for tf, pg, and  aa, respectively. numbers of ec and fn in saliva were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.01). the values of dna (fg) per cfu ranged from 64 for ec to 121 for  pg. conclusion: the real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu can be used to quantitate periodontal pathogens in saliva and estimate the number of live bacteria (cfu). clinical relevance: this real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu has the potential to be an adjunct in evaluation of periodontal health status.

TI  == bimix antimicrobial scaffolds for regenerative endodontics.
AB  == introduction: eliminating and/or inhibiting bacterial growth within the root canal system has been shown to play a key role in the regenerative outcome. the aim of this study was to synthesize and determine in vitro both the antimicrobial effectiveness and cytocompatibility of bimix antibiotic-containing polydioxanone-based polymer scaffolds. methods: antibiotic-containing (metronidazole [met] and ciprofloxacin [cip]) polymer solutions (distinct antibiotic weight ratios) were spun into fibers as a potential mimic to the double antibiotic paste (dap, a met/cip mixture). fiber morphology, chemical characteristics, and tensile strength were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and tensile testing, respectively. antimicrobial efficacy was tested over time (aliquot collection) against enterococcus faecalis (ef), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). similarly, cytotoxicity was evaluated in human dental pulp stem cells. data were statistically analyzed (p < .05). results: scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that electrospinning was able to produce antibiotic-containing fibers with a diameter mostly in the nanoscale. the tensile strength of 1:1met/cip scaffolds was significantly (p < .05) higher than pure polydioxanone (control). meanwhile, all other groups presented similar strength as the control. aliquots obtained from antibiotic-containing scaffolds inhibited the growth of ef, pg, and fn, except pure met, which did not show an inhibitory action toward pg or fn. antibiotic-containing aliquots promoted slight human dental pulp stem cell viability reduction, but none of them were considered to be cytotoxic. conclusions: our data suggest that the incorporation of multiple antibiotics within a nanofibrous scaffold holds great potential toward the development of a drug delivery system for regenerative endodontics.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == proteomics of fusobacterium nucleatum within a model developing oral microbial community.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is a common oral organism that can provide adhesive and metabolic support to developing periodontal bacterial communities. it is within the context of these communities that disease occurs. we have previously reported whole cell proteomics analyses of porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii in early-stage communities with each other and with f. nucleatum, modeled using 18 h pellets. here, we report the adaptation of f. nucleatum to the same experimental conditions as measured by differential protein expression. about 1210 f. nucleatum proteins were detected in single species f. nucleatum control samples, 1192 in communities with p. gingivalis, 1224 with s. gordonii, and 1135 with all three species. quantitative comparisons among the proteomes revealed important changes in all mixed samples with distinct responses to p. gingivalis or s. gordonii alone and in combination. the results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david (database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery). extensive changes were detected in energy metabolism. all multispecies comparisons showed reductions in amino acid fermentation and a shift toward butanoate as a metabolic byproduct, although the  two organism model community with s. gordonii showed increases in alanine, threonine, methionine, and cysteine pathways, and in the three species samples there were increases in lysine and methionine. the communities with p. gingivalis or all three organisms showed reduced glycolysis proteins, but f. nucleatum paired with s. gordonii displayed increased glycolysis/gluconeogenesis proteins.  the s. gordonii containing two organism model also showed increases in the ethanolamine pathway while the three species sample showed decreases relative to  the f. nucleatum single organism control. all of the nascent model communities displayed reduced translation, lipopolysaccharide, and cell wall biosynthesis, dna replication and dna repair.

TI  == an in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: the impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. the aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. the  selected species used represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. the number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative pcr (qpcr). as outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. results: the bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. significance: while the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of  inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.

TI  == axenic culture of a candidate division tm7 bacterium from the human oral cavity and biofilm interactions with other oral bacteria.
AB  == the diversity of bacterial species in the human oral cavity is well recognized, but a high proportion of them are presently uncultivable. candidate division tm7  bacteria are almost always detected in metagenomic studies but have not yet been  cultivated. in this paper, we identified candidate division tm7 bacterial phylotypes in mature plaque samples from around orthodontic bonds in subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment. successive rounds of enrichment in laboratory media led to the isolation of a pure culture of one of these candidate division tm7 phylotypes. the bacteria formed filaments of 20 to 200 mum in length within agar plate colonies and in monospecies biofilms on salivary pellicle and exhibited some unusual morphological characteristics by transmission electron microscopy, including a trilaminated cell surface layer and dense cytoplasmic deposits. proteomic analyses of cell wall protein extracts identified abundant polypeptides predicted from the tm7 partial genomic sequence. pleiomorphic phenotypes were observed when the candidate division tm7 bacterium was grown in dual-species biofilms with representatives of six different oral bacterial genera. the tm7 bacterium formed long filaments in dual-species biofilm communities with actinomyces oris or fusobacterium nucleatum. however, the tm7 isolate grew as short rods or cocci in dual-species biofilms with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, or streptococcus gordonii, forming notably robust biofilms with the latter two species. the ability to cultivate tm7 axenically should majorly advance understanding of the physiology,  genetics, and virulence properties of this novel candidate division oral bacterium.

TI  == reducing the bioactivity of tannerella forsythia lipopolysaccharide by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is considered a pathogen of periodontitis and forms a biofilm with multi-species bacteria in oral cavity. lipopolysaccharide is a powerful immunostimulator and induces inflammation and shock. the purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of t. forsythia lps in its co-cultivation with fusobacterium nucleatum or porphyromonas gingivalis. t. forsythia was co-cultured in the presence and absence of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis and then t. forsythia lps was extracted. the extracts were analyzed by sds-page and nf-kappab reporter cho cell lines. thp-1 cells were treated with the lps and evaluated induction of cytokine expression by real-time rt-pcr and elisa. for analysis of the bioactivity of t. forsythia lps, the binding assay on lps-binding protein (lbp) and cd14 was processed. the extracts did not contaminate other molecules except lps and showed tlr4 agonists. co-cultured t. forsythia lps with p. gingivalis exhibited a lower level of induction of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-6 expression than single- or co-cultured t. forsythia lps with f. nucleatum in the conditions of human serum. however, the three t. forsythia lps did not show difference of cytokine induction in the serum free conditions. co-cultured t. forsythia lps with p. gingivalis exhibited a lower affinity to lbp and cd14 as binding site of o-antigen and attached at a lower level to thp-1 cells compared to single- or co-cultured t. forsythia lps with f.  nucleatum. the virulence of t. forsythia lps was decreased by co-culturing with p. gingivalis and their affinity to lbp and cd14 was reduced, which may due to modification of o-antigen chain by p. gingivalis.

TI  == microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16s rrna gene clone library analysis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. methodology: apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the  kyushu university hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. dna was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16s rrna gene. enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and specific fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis with specific primers. results: bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were p. gingivalis (19.9%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and propionibacterium acnes (9%). bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. in addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: prevotella spp., treponema spp., peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113, olsenella uli, slackia exigua, selemonas infelix, p. gingivalis with type iv fima, and a combination of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113 and predominance of streptococcus spp. on the other hand, neither enterococcus faecalis nor c. albicans were detected in any of the samples. conclusion: whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the  persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. the diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.

AB  == periodontal disease is a polymicrobial inflammatory disease that leads to chronic systemic inflammation and direct infiltration of bacteria/bacterial components, which may contribute to the development of alzheimer's disease. apoe-/- mice were orally infected (n = 12) with porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum as mono- and polymicrobial infections. apoe-/- mice were sacrificed following 12 and 24 weeks of chronic infection. bacterial genomic dna was isolated from all brain tissues except for the f. nucleatum mono-infected group. polymerase chain reaction was performed using universal 16 s rdna primers and species-specific primer sets for each organism to determine whether the infecting pathogens accessed the brain. sequencing amplification products confirmed the invasion of bacteria into the brain during infection. the innate immune responses were detected using antibodies against complement activation products of c3 convertase stage and the  membrane attack complex. molecular methods demonstrated that 6 out of 12 apoe-/-  mice brains contained p. gingivalis genomic dna at 12 weeks (p = 0.006), and 9 out of 12 at 24 weeks of infection (p = 0.0001). microglia in both infected and control groups demonstrated strong intracellular labeling with c3 and c9, due to  on-going biosynthesis. the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in 4 out of 12 infected mice brains demonstrated characteristic opsonization with c3 activation  fragments (p = 0.032). these results show that the oral pathogen p. gingivalis was able to access the apoe-/- mice brain and thereby contributed to complement activation with bystander neuronal injury.

TI  == high-level antimicrobial efficacy of representative mediterranean natural plant extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  == nature is an unexplored reservoir of novel phytopharmaceuticals. since biofilm-related oral diseases often correlate with antibiotic resistance, plant-derived antimicrobial agents could enhance existing treatment options. therefore, the rationale of the present report was to examine the antimicrobial impact of mediterranean natural extracts on oral microorganisms. five different extracts from olea europaea, mastic gum, and inula viscosa were tested against ten bacteria and one candida albicans strain. the extraction protocols were conducted according to established experimental procedures. two antimicrobial assays--the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) assay--were applied. the screened extracts were  found to be active against each of the tested microorganisms. o. europaea presented mic and mbc ranges of 0.07-10.00 mg ml(-1) and 0.60-10.00 mg ml(-1), respectively. the mean mbc values for mastic gum and i. viscosa were 0.07-10.00 mg ml(-1) and 0.15-10.00 mg ml(-1), respectively. extracts were less effective against c. albicans and exerted bactericidal effects at a concentration range of  0.07-5.00 mg ml(-1) on strict anaerobic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and parvimonas micra). ethyl acetate i. viscosa extract and total mastic extract showed considerable antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms and could therefore be considered as alternative natural anti-infectious agents.

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == development of an in vitro periodontal biofilm model for assessing antimicrobial  and host modulatory effects of bioactive molecules.
AB  == background: inflammation within the oral cavity occurs due to dysregulation between microbial biofilms and the host response. understanding how different oral hygiene products influence inflammatory properties is important for the development of new products. therefore, creation of a robust host-pathogen biofilm platform capable of evaluating novel oral healthcare compounds is an attractive option. we therefore devised a multi-species biofilm co-culture model  to evaluate the naturally derived polyphenol resveratrol (rsv) and gold standard  chlorhexidine (chx) with respect to anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: an in vitro multi-species biofilm containing s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans was created to represent a  disease-associated biofilm and the oral epithelial cell in okf6-tert2. cytotoxicity studies were performed using rsv and chx. multi-species biofilms were either treated with either molecule, or alternatively epithelial cells were  treated with these prior to biofilm co-culture. biofilm composition was evaluated and inflammatory responses quantified at a transcriptional and protein level. results: chx was toxic to epithelial cells and multi-species biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.2%. rsv did not effect multi-species biofilm composition, but was toxic to epithelial cells at concentrations greater than 0.01%. in co-culture, chx-treated biofilms resulted in down regulation of the inflammatory chemokine il-8 at both mrna and protein level. rsv-treated epithelial cells in co-culture were down-regulated in the release of il-8 protein, but not mrna. conclusions: chx possesses potent bactericidal properties, which may impact downstream inflammatory mediators. rsv does not appear to have bactericidal properties against multi-species biofilms, however it did appear to  supress epithelial cells from releasing inflammatory mediators. this study demonstrates the potential to understand the mechanisms by which different oral hygiene products may influence gingival inflammation, thereby validating the use  of a biofilm co-culture model.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == effects of stress hormones on the production of volatile sulfur compounds by periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == little is known about the effects of stress hormones on the etiologic agents of halitosis. thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the effects of adrenaline (adr), noradrenaline (na) and cortisol (cort) on bacteria that produce volatile sulfur compounds (vsc), the major gases responsible for bad breath. cultures of fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas endodontalis (pe), prevotella intermedia (pi) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were exposed to 50 microm adr, na and cort or equivalent volumes of sterile water as controls for 12 and 24 h. growth was evaluated based on absorbance at 660 nm. portable gas chromatography was used to measure vsc concentrations. kruskal-wallis and the dunn post-hoc test were used to compare the groups. for fn, adr, na and cort significantly reduced bacterial growth after 12 h and 24 h (p<0.05). all the substances tested increased hydrogen sulfide (h2s) production (p<0.05). for pe, all the substances tested reduced bacterial development after 24 h (p<0.05), and  na significantly increased the h2s concentration after 12 h (p<0.05). in the pg and pi cultures, no effects on bacterial growth were observed (p>0.05). in the pi cultures, adr, na and cort increased h2s (p<0.05). catecholamines and cortisol can interfere with growth and h2s production of sub-gingival species in vitro. this process appears to be complex and supports the association between stress and the production of vsc.

TI  == the interaction of implant luting cements and oral bacteria linked to peri-implant disease: an in vitro analysis of planktonic and biofilm growth - a preliminary study.
AB  == background: there is little consensus on the most appropriate cement to use when  restoring a cement-retained, implant-supported restoration. one consideration should be the interaction of pathogenic oral bacteria with restorative cements. purpose: to determine how oral bacteria associated with peri-implant disease grow in the presence of implant cements. materials and methods: five test cements with varying composition (zinc oxide-eugenol [tbo], eugenol-free zinc oxide [tbne], zinc orthophosphate [fl], and two resin cements [pic and ml]) were used to fabricate specimen disks. the disks were submerged in bacterial suspensions of either aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, or porphyromonas gingivalis. planktonic bacterial growth within the test media was measured by determining the optical density of the cultures (od600 ). positive controls (media and bacteria without cement disks) and negative controls (media alone) were similarly evaluated. the mean and standard deviations (sd) were calculated for planktonic growth from three separate experiments. anova statistical analysis with post hoc tukey tests was performed where differences existed (p < .05). selected cement disks (tbo and ml) were further examined for bacterial biofilm growth. surface bacteria were removed and grown on agar media,  and colony-forming units (cfus) were quantified. results: planktonic growth for both a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis was significantly inhibited (p <  .05) when grown in the presence of cement disks consisting of tbne, pic, fl, and  tbo. in contrast, neither of these bacteria displayed growth inhibition in the presence of ml cement disks. f. nucleatum growth was also significantly inhibited by pic, fl. and tbo (p < .05), but not by ml and tbne cement disks. cfu counts for the biofilm study for tbo gave minimal and, in some instances, no bacterial adherence and growth, in contrast to ml, which supported substantially greater bacterial biofilm growth. conclusion: cements display differing abilities to inhibit both planktonic and biofilm bacterial growth. cements with the ability to reduce planktonic or biofilm growth of the test bacteria may be advantageous in reducing peri-implant disease. understanding the microbial growth-inhibiting characteristics of different cement types should be considered important in the selection criteria.

TI  == internal bacterial colonization of implants: association with peri-implant bone loss.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present longitudinal study was to investigate bacterial colonization of the internal implant cavity and to evaluate a possible  association with peri-implant bone loss. methods: a total of 264 paper point samples were harvested from the intra-implant cavity of 66 implants in 26 patients immediately following implant insertion and after 3, 4, and 12 months. samples were evaluated for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola,  and tannerella forsythia as well as total bacterial counts by real-time pcr. bone loss was evaluated on standardized radiographs up to 25 months after implant insertion. for the statistical analysis of the data, mixed effects models were fitted. results: there was an increase in the frequency of detection as well as in the mean counts of the selected bacteria over time. the evaluation of the target bacteria revealed a significant association of pr. intermedia at 4 and 12  months with peri-implant bone loss at 25 months (4 months: p = 0.009; 12 months:  p = 0.021). conclusions: the present study could demonstrate a progressive colonization by periodontopathogenic bacteria in the internal cavities of two-piece implants. the results suggest that internal colonization with pr. intermedia was associated with peri-implant bone loss.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  == background: localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. the causative bacterial species in israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of lagp in this population. the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an israeli lagp population who were also clinically assessed. methods: twenty-one lagp patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. mann-whitney u test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. results: higher  levels of parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), fusobacterium nucleatum/f. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the lagp group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia were higher in the cp group. conclusions: the characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of lagp patients in israel is mainly comprised of p. micra, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum/f. periodonticum and t. forsythia. similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of lagp when individual sampling is not possible.

TI  == subgingival bacteria in ghanaian adolescents with or without progression of attachment loss.
AB  == objective: this study describes subgingival bacterial profiles associated with clinical periodontal status in ghanaian adolescents with or without progression of attachment loss. materials and methods: among 500 adolescents included in a cohort study, 397 returned 2 years later for a periodontal re-examination, including full-mouth cal measurements. at follow-up, a subgroup of 98 adolescents was also subjected to bacterial sampling with paper points at four periodontal sites (mesial aspect of 11, 26, 31, and 46) and analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique against dna-probes from nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species. results: the 98 ghanaian adolescents  examined in the present study were similar to the entire group examined at the 2-year follow-up with respect to age, gender, and cal >/=3 mm. a high detection frequency of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia (>99%) using checkerboard analysis was found, while for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  the detection frequency was <50%. a strong correlation was found at the individual level between the presence of p. intermedia and the total cal change,  and p. intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis were strongly correlated with a change in cal and probing pocket depth (ppd) at the sampled sites. in a linear regression model, a significant discriminating factor for the total cal change in the dentition during the 2-year follow-up period was obtained for p. intermedia and public school. conclusion: this study indicates that subgingival bacterial species other than a. actinomycetemcomitans, for example, p. intermedia, have a significant association with periodontal breakdown (change in cal) in ghanaian adolescents with progression of periodontal attachment loss.

TI  == relationship between expression of human gingival beta-defensins and levels of periodontopathogens in subgingival plaque.
AB  == background and objective: human beta-defensins (hbds) are a group of antimicrobial peptides important in epithelial innate immunity, and their differential expression is associated with periodontal diseases. the aim of this  study was to explore relationships among hbds, total subgingival bacteria and periodontopathogens in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: the periodontal clinical parameters of 29 healthy subjects and 25 patients with chronic periodontitis were recorded. the relative expression of hbd1, hbd2 and hbd3 genes in gingival biopsies was measured using real-time pcr. the numbers of total bacteria and of treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque were quantified by real-time pcr. data were analyzed using the mann-whitney u-test and spearman's rank correlation test. results: no significant differences in expression of the hbd genes were found between the group of healthy subjects and  the group of patients with chronic periodontitis. total bacteria and t. denticola were detected in all participants. f. nucleatum and t. forsythia were detected in all patients with chronic periodontitis and in 86.21% and 51.72%, respectively, of healthy volunteers. p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in 24.14% and 17.24%, respectively, of the healthy group and in 84.00% and 12.00%, respectively, of the chronic periodontitis group. the prevalence of all bacteria, except a. actinomycetemcomitans, was significantly higher in the group  of patients with chronic periodontitis than in the group of healthy subjects (p < 0.05). a significant, negative correlation was observed between total bacteria and hbd-2 (r = -0.384, p = 0.011). upon analyzing the data in different groups, total bacteria and hbd-2 were significantly correlated (r = -0.492, p = 0.026) only in the group of healthy subjects. conclusion: the negative correlations between hbd-2 and total bacteria, especially in the group of healthy subjects, indicate that hbds may play an important role by limiting an increase of bacterial load at the initial stage of periodontitis.

TI  == a periodontitis-associated multispecies model of an oral biofilm.
AB  == purpose: while single-species biofilms have been studied extensively, we know notably little regarding multispecies biofilms and their interactions. the purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate an in vitro multispecies dental biofilm model that aimed to mimic the environment of chronic periodontitis. methods: streptococcus gordonii kn1, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc23726, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc33384, and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc33277 were used for this experiment. the biofilms were grown on 12-well plates with a round glass slip (12 mm in diameter) with a supply of fresh medium. four different single-species biofilms and multispecies biofilms with the four bacterial strains listed above were prepared. the biofilms were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (clsm) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) for four different planktonic single-species and multispecies bacteria were determined. the mics of doxycycline and chlorhexidine for four different single-species biofilms and a multispecies biofilm were also determined. results: the clsm and sem examination revealed that the growth pattern of the multispecies biofilm was similar to those of single-species biofilms. however, the multispecies biofilm became thicker than the single-species biofilms, and networks between bacteria were formed. the mics  of doxycycline and chlorhexidine were higher in the biofilm state than in the planktonic bacteria. the mic of doxycycline for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, or a. actinomycetemcomitans. the mic of chlorhexidine for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. conclusions: to mimic the natural dental biofilm, a multispecies biofilm composed of four bacterial species was grown. the 24-hour multispecies biofilm may be useful as a laboratory dental biofilm model system.

AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == an endodontic-periodontal lesion with primary periodontal disease: a case report  on its bacterial profile.
AB  == the microflora in the periodontal pockets can affect the dental pulp and cause endodontic-periodontal lesions or retrograde pulpitis. here we report an endodontic-periodontal lesion together with its bacterial profile. the lesion occurred in the maxillary right first molar of a 40-year-old woman who presented  at our hospital complaining of a violent toothache since the previous night. clinically, the tooth was caries-free and an electric pulp test showed it to be vital. the tooth showed signs of advanced periodontitis and the periodontal pocket was deep, reaching the apex of the palatal root. the clinical diagnosis was an endodontic-periodontal lesion with primary periodontal disease. subsequent endodontic treatment comprised pulp extirpation and root canal filling, followed  by periodontal treatment consisting of scaling and root planing. the tooth was finally restored with a full metal crown. no further signs of periodontal disease or periapical lesions have been observed to date. bacteria were sampled from the  root canal and periodontal pocket for a microbiological assessment using 16s rrna gene-based pcr. microbiologically, the profile of the bacterial species from the  palatal root canal was similar to that from the periodontal pocket of the palatal root. porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens were detected in both samples. the occurrence of bacteria common to both sites in this patient further supports the proposition that periodontal disease is the definitive source of root canal infections. the present results suggest that a bacterial examination would be helpful in confirming and supporting the clinical  diagnosis in such lesions.

AB  == background: a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method has been used to identify oral anaerobic pathogens in biofilms on voice prostheses. the purpose of the present study was to determine the location of those pathogens inside the biofilms. methods: biofilms of 15 voice prostheses were sampled and used to identify the oral pathogens. fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied on smears made on glass slides and on sections of intact biofilms visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). results: fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) was the most frequently detected pathogen and the only tested species  detected in microcolonies. the other microbes (parvimonas micra [p. micra], porphyromonas gingivalis [p. gingivalis], tannerella forsythia [t. forsythia], and treponema denticola [t. denticola]) were not detected or only detected as single cells. clsm analysis showed that f. nucleatum resided on the biofilm surface. conclusion: although detectable, oral anaerobic pathogens seem to be no  more than passers-by that adhere without further observed proliferation and apparently play no striking role in biofilm formation on voice prostheses.

TI  == microbiological assessment of the implant-abutment interface in different connections: cross-sectional study after 5 years of functional loading.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the bacterial microflora present inside the implant connection and in the peri-implant sulcus fluid of healthy implants, and to analyze the relationships between these harboring sites for four different implant systems after at least 5 years of functional loading. materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was performed involving 40 patients treated with metal-ceramic cemented bridges supported by at least two healthy implants functionally loaded for 5 years. four different implant-abutment connections were studied: external hexagon (control group), double internal hexagon (test group 1), internal hexagon with external collar (test group 2), and conical connection  (test group 3). samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three types of sites: peri-implant sulci, connections' inside and abutments surface and, as control, gingival sulci of neighboring teeth. quantitative real-time pcr  was carried out for total bacterial count and for 10 microorganisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and candida albicans. the response variables were percentage of positive sites and absolute bacterial load. the relations of the response variables with the type of connection and of sampling site were assessed using generalized estimating equations. results: regarding the analysis of positivity to bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus no significant differences were observed. analyzing the connection's inside, none of the connection designs had the capacity to prevent microbiological leakage through the implant/abutment microgap. test group 3 presented the lowest mean values for red complex bacteria and control group the highest, although differences were non-significant. statistical significance was  only reached for treponema denticola in the bacterial load analysis inside the connection. test groups 1 and 2 yielded lower values for orange complex bacteria  but only for peptostreptococos micros the differences resulted significant. test  groups 2 and 3 had significantly lower total bacterial counts in the peri-implant sulcus and inside the connection. conclusions: outcomes suggested that all the analyzed connections resulted contaminated after 5 years of functional loading. however, the connection design might influence bacterial activity levels qualitatively and quantitatively, especially inside the implant connection.

TI  == evaluation of the sealing capability of implants to titanium and zirconia abutments against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum under different screw torque values.
AB  == statement of problem: when evaluating long-term implant success, clinicians have  always been concerned with the gap at the implant-abutment junction, where bacteria can accumulate and cause marginal bone loss. however, little information regarding bacterial leakage at the implant-abutment junction, or microgap, is available. purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate sealing at 2 different implant-abutment interfaces under different screw torque values. material and methods: twenty sterile zirconia abutments and 20 sterile titanium abutments were screwed into 40 sterile implants and placed in test tubes. the ability of a bacterial mixture of prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum to leak through an implant-titanium abutment seal under 20 and 35 ncm torque values and an implant-zirconia abutment  seal under 20 and 35 ncm torque values was evaluated daily until leakage was noted. once a unit demonstrated leakage, a specimen was plated. after 4 days, the number of colonies on each plate was counted with an electronic colony counter. plating was used to verify whether or not bacterial leakage occurred and when leakage first occurred. the implant-abutment units were removed and rinsed with phosphate buffered saline solution and evaluated with a stereomicroscope. the marginal gap between the implant and the abutment was measured and correlated with the amount of bacterial leakage. the data were analyzed with anova. results: bacterial leakage was noted in all specimens, regardless of material or screw torque value. with titanium abutments, changing the screw torque value from 20 to 35 ncm did not significantly affect the amount of bacterial leakage. however, with zirconia abutments, changing the screw torque value from 20 to 35 ncm was statistically significant (p<.017). overall, the marginal gap noted was larger at the zirconia-abutment interface (5.25 +/-1.99 mum) than the titanium-abutment interface (12.38 +/-3.73 mum), irrespective of the screw torque value. stereomicroscopy revealed a nonuniform marginal gap in all specimens. conclusion: the results of this study showed that, over time, bacteria will leak through the  implant-abutment microgap at the implant-abutment interface. implants with a titanium abutment demonstrate a smaller microgap than implants with a zirconia abutment. tightening the zirconia abutment screw from 20 to 35 ncm decreases the  size of the microgap, which suggests a more intimate fit between the implant and  the abutment.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of various saturated and unsaturated fatty acids against several oral pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of various saturated fatty acids (sfa) and unsaturated fatty acids (usfa) against different oral pathogens which are implicated in the cause of dental caries, stomatitis, gingivitis, and periodontitis was examined. the saturated fatty acids pa, sta and ara, and the unsaturated omega-7 fatty acids pla and omega-9 fatty acids oa showed either none to low antimicrobial activity against all of the 12 oral pathogenic strains used in this study. in contrast, the omega-3 pufas, ala, sda, epa and dha, and the omega-6 pufas, la, gla, and aa showed considerable antimicrobial activity against 8, 7, 6 and 5 strains, and 6, 10 and 5 strains, respectively. in particular, the omega-3 and omega-6 pufas showed strong antimicrobial activity against porphyromonas gingivalis kctc 381, the cause of periodontitis, and against aggregatibacter segnis kctc 5968, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum kctc 5172 and prevotella intermedia kctc 25611, all organisms implicated in the cause of gingivitis. to date, no bacterial resistance to free fatty acids has been encountered and no resistance phenotype has emerged. therefore, these results suggest that pufas may be useful in the development of therapeutic agents for oral diseases, and in particular, in the development of agents that have minimal  side effects and against which there is no bacterial resistance.

TI  == effect of bacteria on the wound healing behavior of oral epithelial cells.
AB  == wounded tissue offers opportunity to microflora to adhere, colonize, invade and infect surrounding healthy tissue. the bacteria of the oral cavity have the potential to alter the wound healing process by interacting with keratinocytes. the aim of this study was to investigate mechanisms through which oral bacteria may influence re-epithelialization by interacting with gingival keratinocytes. by an in vitro scratch assay we demonstrate that primary gingival keratinocytes have impaired closure when exposed to two well characterized oral bacteria, p. gingivalis, and to a lesser extent, f. nucleatum. p. gingivalis reduced wound closure by approximately 40%, which was partially dependent on proteolytic activity, and bacteria was still present within infected cells 9 days later despite exposure to bacteria for only 24 h. both oral bacteria caused keratinocyte apoptosis at the wound site with cell death being greatest at the wound edge. p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum adversely affected cell proliferation  and the effect also had a spatial component being most striking at the edge. the  impact of the bacteria was long lasting even when exposure was brief. cell migration was compromised in bacteria challenged keratinocytes with p. gingivalis having more severe effect (p<0.05) than f. nucleatum. quantitative real time pcr  of bacteria challenged cells showed that p. gingivalis and to a lesser extent f.  nucleatum significantly downregulated cell cycle genes cyclin1, cdk1, and cdk4 (p<0.05) that are critical for gi/s transition. further, genes associated with cell migration such as integrin beta-3 and -6 were significantly downregulated by p. gingivalis (p<0.05).

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == short-chain fatty acids from periodontal pathogens suppress histone deacetylases, ezh2, and suv39h1 to promote kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus replication.
AB  == periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum produce five different short-chain fatty acids (scfas) as metabolic by-products. we detect significantly higher levels of scfas in the saliva of patients with severe periodontal disease. the different scfas stimulate lytic gene expression of kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) dose dependently and synergistically. scfas inhibit class-1/2 histone deacetylases (hdacs) and downregulate expression of silent information regulator-1 (sirt1). scfas also downregulate expression of enhancer of zeste homolog2 (ezh2) and suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog1 (suv39h1), which are two histone n-lysine  methyltransferases (hlmts). by suppressing the different components of host epigenetic regulatory machinery, scfas increase histone acetylation and decrease  repressive histone trimethylations to transactivate the viral chromatin. these new findings provide mechanistic support that scfas from periodontal pathogens stimulate kshv replication and infection in the oral cavity and are potential risk factors for development of oral kaposi's sarcoma (ks). importance: about 20% of ks patients develop ks lesions first in the oral cavity, while other patients  never develop oral ks. it is not known if the oral microenvironment plays a role  in oral ks tumor development. in this work, we demonstrate that a group of metabolic by-products, namely, short-chain fatty acids, from bacteria that cause  periodontal disease promote lytic replication of kshv, the etiological agent associated with ks. these new findings provide mechanistic support that periodontal pathogens create a unique microenvironment in the oral cavity that contributes to kshv replication and development of oral ks.

TI  == inhibitory effects of sword bean extract on alveolar bone resorption induced in rats by porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  == background: the domesticated legume, canavalia gladiata (commonly called the sword bean), is known to contain canavanine. the fruit is used in chinese and japanese herbal medicine for treating the discharge of pus, but its pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear. objectives: this study examined the effect of sword bean extract (sbe) on (i) oral bacteria and human oral epithelial cells in vitro, and (ii) the initiation and progression of experimental porphyromonas gingivalis-induced alveolar bone resorption in rats. material and methods: a high-performance liquid chromatography/ultraviolet method was applied  to quantitate canavanine in sbe. by assessing oral bacterial growth, we estimated the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of sbe, canavanine, chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) solution. the cytotoxicity of sbe, canavanine, chx, leupeptin and cystatin for kb cells was determined using a trypan blue assay. the effects of sbe, canavanine, leupeptin and cystatin on arg-gingipain (rgp) and lys-gingipain (kgp) were evaluated by colorimetric assay  using synthetic substrates. to examine its effects on p. gingivalis-associated periodontal tissue breakdown, sbe was orally administered to p. gingivalis-infected rats. result: sword bean extract contained 6.4% canavanine. sbe and canavanine inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. the cytotoxicity of sbe, canavanine and cystatin on kb cells was significantly lower than that of chx. inhibition of rgp with sbe was comparable to that with leupeptin, a known rgp inhibitor, and inhibition of kgp with sbe was significantly higher than that with leupeptin at 500 mug/ml ( p < 0.05). p. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone resorption was significantly suppressed by administration of sbe, with bone levels remaining comparable to non-infected animals ( p < 0.05). conclusion: the present study suggests that sbe might be effective against p. gingivalis-associated alveolar bone resorption.

TI  == in vitro growth characteristics and volatile sulfur compound production of solobacterium moorei.
AB  == solobacterium moorei has recently been implicated as a causative agent of halitosis. in vitro experiments to evaluate the role of s. moorei in halitosis have, however, been complicated by a paucity of information on the ideal conditions for culturing this organism. this work aimed to optimize a liquid culture medium for s. moorei, and to determine the growth-curve of the organism.  further, the ability of s. moorei to generate volatile sulfur compounds was investigated and compared quantitatively to other oral anaerobes by an optimized  head-space gas chromatography method. serum-supplementation of standard liquid growth media gave greater growth of s. moorei than non-supplemented broths, with  the best medium found to be serum-supplemented tryptone soya broth. s. moorei was able to metabolize cysteine directly to hydrogen sulfide, but was unable to produce methanethiol from methionine. s. moorei produced 2-3 times more hydrogen  sulfide (normalized for colony forming units) than porphyromonas gingivalis and veillonella dispar, but considerably less than fusobacterium nucleatum. the study has identified reliable growth conditions for culture of s. moorei, which were employed to show that s. moorei has the requisite biochemistry consistent with a  potential role in halitosis.

TI  == prevotella intermedia induces severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in mice with upregulated platelet-activating factor receptor expression.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of respiratory infection worldwide. although oral hygiene has been considered a risk factor for developing pneumonia, the relationship between oral bacteria and pneumococcal infection is unknown. in  this study, we examined the synergic effects of prevotella intermedia, a major periodontopathic bacterium, on pneumococcal pneumonia. the synergic effects of the supernatant of p. intermedia (pisup) on pneumococcal pneumonia were investigated in mice, and the stimulation of pneumococcal adhesion to human alveolar (a549) cells by pisup was assessed. the effects of pisup on platelet-activating factor receptor (pafr) transcript levels in vitro and in vivo were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr, and the differences between the effects of pneumococcal infection induced by various periodontopathic bacterial species were verified in mice. mice inoculated with s. pneumoniae plus pisup exhibited a significantly lower survival rate, higher bacterial loads in the lungs, spleen, and blood, and higher inflammatory cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) than those infected without pisup. in a549 cells, pisup increased pneumococcal adhesion and pafr transcript levels. pisup also increased  lung pafr transcript levels in mice. similar effects were not observed in the supernatants of porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum. thus, p. intermedia has the potential to induce severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia with enhanced pneumococcal adhesion to lower airway cells.

TI  == photodynamic antimicrobial effect of safranine o on an ex vivo periodontal biofilm.
AB  == background and objective: the increasing resistance of oral pathogens against antibiotic measures urgently requires new therapeutic strategies. in this context, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) may play a crucial part in the future. the aim of the present study was to compare the antibacterial efficiency  of apdt using the photosensitizer safranine o with that of chlorhexidine (0.2% chx) on an ex vivo biofilm. methods: first the antibacterial activity of both measures against planktonic cultures of streptococcus gordonii atcc 33399, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 33384 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 was observed. then a patient specific ex vivo biofilm was established  from plaque and saliva samples of patients (n = 19) with chronic periodontitis. the antibacterial effects of apdt and of 0.2% chx were determined on the ex vivo  biofilms cultivated for 24 and 72 hours. after cultivation of the treated samples on blood agar (2 days) the results were quantified by counting the colony forming units (cfu/ml). results: photodynamic treatment with safranine o showed a distinct antibacterial effect on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. whereas s. gordonii was suppressed completely by apdt, treatment with 0.2% chx caused only a partial reduction. in the ex vivo biofilm model (24-hour biofilm), apdt caused a  significantly higher bacterial killing than treatment with 0.2% chx. compared to  the untreated control, there was no significant difference on the 72-hour biofilm for both methods. conclusions: the results show that oral-pathogenic species in planktonic solution can be suppressed significantly by apdt with safranine o. especially for bacteria in a 24-hour ex vivo biofilm, this method is more effective than treatment with 0.2% chx. both antibacterial treatments did not show any significant effect on the biofilm cultivated for 72 hours.

TI  == in vitro activity of carvacrol against titanium-adherent oral biofilms and planktonic cultures.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to test the effect of carvacrol against oral pathogens and their preformed biofilms on titanium disc surface. methods: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) and biofilm inhibitory concentration (bic) were performed to evaluate carvacrol antibacterial activity, while flow cytometry (fcm) was used to verify the carvacrol effect on esterase activity and membrane permeability. carvacrol was tested in vitro on single- and multi-species biofilms formed on titanium disc by  streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 or fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, in different combinations, comparing its effect to that of chlorhexidine. results: the pathogens were sensitive to carvacrol with mics and mbcs values of 0.25 % and 0.50 % and bics of 0.5 % for s. mutans atcc 25175 and 1 % for p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586. fcm analysis showed that treatment of planktonic cultures with carvacrol caused an increase of damaged cells and a decrement of bacteria with active esterase activity. moreover, carvacrol demonstrated greater biofilm formation preventive property compared to chlorhexidine against titanium-adherent single- and multi-specie biofilms, with statistically significant values. conclusions: carvacrol showed inhibitory activity against the tested oral pathogens and biofilm formation preventive property on their oral biofilm; then, it could be utilized to control and prevent the colonization of microorganisms with particular significance in human oral diseases. clinical relevance: this natural  compound may be proposed in daily hygiene formulations or as an alternative agent supporting traditional antimicrobial protocols to prevent periodontal diseases in implanted patients.

TI  == phototargeting human periodontal pathogens in vivo.
AB  == the effects of blue light at 455 nm were investigated on the bacterial composition of human dental plaque in vivo. eleven subjects who refrained from brushing for 3 days before and during phototherapy participated in the study. light with a power density of 70 mw/cm(2) was applied to the buccal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth on one side of the mouth twice daily for 2 min over a period of 4 days. dental plaque was harvested at baseline and again at the end of 4 days from eight posterior teeth on both the exposed side and unexposed sides of the mouth. microbiological changes were monitored by checkerboard dna probe analysis of 40 periodontal bacteria. the proportions of black-pigmented species porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced on  the exposed side from their original proportions by 25 and 56 %, respectively, while no change was observed to the unexposed side. five other species showed the greatest proportional reduction of the light-exposed side relative to the unexposed side. these species were streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, and capnocytophaga sputigena. at the same time, the percentage of  gingival areas scored as being red decreased on the side exposed to light from 48 to 42 %, whereas the percentage scored as red increased on the unexposed side from 53 to 56 %. no adverse effects were found or reported in this study. the present study proposes a new method to modify the ecosystem in dental plaque by phototherapy and introduces a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

(p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16s rdna gene sequence.
AB  == purpose: to analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16s rdna gene sequences. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of  patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. in both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. an anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. the bacterial strains were identified by 16s rdna genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. results: peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. a total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. the predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were eubacterium nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, parascardovia denticolens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, centipeda periodontii, and parvimonas micra. the predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from streptococcus were pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces species, propionibacterium acnes, and parvimonas micra. conclusion: these results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. the present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (aagprs) such as e. nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that aagprs may also play an important role.

AB  == background: human mesenchymal stem cells (hmscs) are multipotent by nature and are originally isolated from bone marrow. in light of a future application of hmscs in the oral cavity, a body compartment with varying oxygen partial pressures and an omnipresence of different bacterial species i.e. periodontitis pathogens, we performed this study to gain information about the behavior of hmsc in an anaerobic system and the response in interaction with oral bacterial pathogens. methodology/principal findings: we established a model system with oral pathogenic bacterial species and eukaryotic cells cultured in anaerobic conditions. the facultative anaerobe bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were studied.  their effects on hmscs and primary as well as permanent gingival epithelial cells (ca9-22, hgpec) were comparatively analyzed. we show that hmscs cope with anoxic  conditions, since 40% vital cells remain after 72 h of anaerobic culture. the ca9-22 and hgpec cells are significantly more sensitive to lack of oxygen. all bacterial species reveal a comparatively low adherence to and internalization into hmscs (0.2% and 0.01% of the initial inoculum, respectively). in comparison, the ca9-22 and hgpec cells present better targets for bacterial adherence and internalization. the production of the pro-inflammatory chemokine il-8 is higher  in both gingival epithelial cell lines compared to hmscs and fusobacterium nucleatum induce a time-dependent cytokine secretion in both cell lines. porphyromonas gingivalis is less effective in stimulating secretion of il-8 in the co-cultivation experiments. conclusions/significance: hmscs are suitable for  use in anoxic regions of the oral cavity. the interaction with local pathogenic bacteria does not result in massive pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. the test system established in this study allowed further investigation of parameters prior to set up of oral hmsc in vivo studies.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of lactobacillus reuteri probiotics in the treatment of chronic periodontitis: a randomized placebo-controlled study.
AB  == aim: the aim of this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of lactobacillus reuteri-containing probiotic lozenges as an adjunct  to scaling and root planing (srp). material and methods: thirty chronic periodontitis patients were recruited and monitored clinically and microbiologically at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks after therapy. all patients received one-stage full-mouth disinfection and randomly assigned over a test (srp + probiotic, n = 15) or control (srp + placebo, n = 15) group. the lozenges were  used two times a day for 12 weeks. results: at week 12, all clinical parameters were significantly reduced in both groups, while there was significantly more pocket depth reduction (p < 0.05) and attachment gain (p < 0.05) in moderate and  deep pockets; more porphyromonas gingivalis reduction was observed in the srp + probiotic group. conclusions: the results indicate that oral administration of l. reuteri lozenges could be a useful adjunct to srp in chronic periodontitis.

TI  == cetylpyridinium chloride suppresses gene expression associated with halitosis.
AB  == objective: halitosis is a common complaint affecting the majority of the population. mouthrinses containing cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) have been used  as oral hygiene aids to suppress oral malodor. although the clinical efficacy of  these mouthrinses has been well-documented, the mechanism whereby cpc reduces malodor is less-well-understood. we hypothesized that cpc suppresses expression of the genes (mgl and cdl) and enzymes responsible for methyl mercaptan (ch3sh) and hydrogen sulfide (h2s) production by oral anaerobes associated with halitosis. in this study, the mgl and cdl expression of porphyromonas gingivalis  and fusobacterium nucleatum in the presence of cpc was investigated. materials and methods: we used a microdilution method to determine the growth and production of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) by p. gingivalis w83 and f. nucleatum atcc 10953 in respective media containing cpc (0.5 mug/ml to 1.5 mug/ml). for metabolic activity, we used an xtt {2,3-bis(2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide} reduction assay. we used real-time rt-pcr and western blotting to evaluate the effect of cpc at sub-mic levels on mgl and cdl expression at the transcriptional  and enzymatic levels. results: cpc inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum at mics of 3 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, and at mbcs of 6 mug/ml and 3 mug/ml, respectively. compared with untreated controls, cpc at 1.5 mug/ml suppressed ch3sh production of p. gingivalis by 69.84%+/-2.88% and h2s production of f. nucleatum by 82.55%+/-8.36% (p<0.05) without affecting metabolic activity. inhibition of mgl mrna (81.58%+/-20.33%) and protein (39.15%+/-6.65%) expression  in p. gingivalis and inhibition of cdl mrna (61.76%+/-13.75%) and protein (64.34%+/-1.62%) expression in f. nucleatum were also noted (p<0.05). conclusion: cpc represents an effective agent for halitosis reduction by inhibiting the growth and suppressing the expression of specific genes related to vsc production in anaerobic periodontal pathogens.

TI  == oral community interactions of filifactor alocis in vitro.
AB  == filifactor alocis is a gram positive anaerobe that is emerging as an important periodontal pathogen. in the oral cavity f. alocis colonizes polymicrobial biofilm communities; however, little is known regarding the nature of the interactions between f. alocis and other oral biofilm bacteria. here we investigate the community interactions of two strains of f. alocis with streptococcus gordonii, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, organisms with differing pathogenic potential in the oral cavity. in an in vitro community development model, s. gordonii was antagonistic to the accumulation of f. alocis into a dual species community. in contrast, f. nucleatum and the type strain of f. alocis formed a synergistic partnership. accumulation of a low passage isolate of f. alocis was also enhanced by f. nucleatum. in three species communities of s. gordonii, f. nucleatum and f. alocis, the antagonistic effects of s. gordonii superseded the synergistic effects of f. nucleatum toward f. alocis. the interaction between a.  actinomycetemcomitans and f. alocis was strain specific and a. actinomycetemcomitans could either stimulate f. alocis accumulation or have no effect depending on the strain. p. gingivalis and f. alocis formed heterotypic communities with the amount of p. gingivalis greater than in the absence of f. alocis. however, while p. gingivalis benefited from the relationship, levels of f. alocis in the dual species community were lower compared to f. alocis alone. the inhibitory effect of p. gingivalis toward f. alocis was dependent, at least partially, on the presence of the mfa1 fimbrial subunit. in addition, ai-2 production by p. gingivalis helped maintain levels of f. alocis. collectively, these results show that the pattern of f. alocis colonization will be dictated by the spatial composition of microbial microenvironments, and that the organism may preferentially accumulate at sites rich in f. nucleatum.

TI  == a chlorhexidine-loaded biodegradable cellulosic device for periodontal pockets treatment.
AB  == absorbent points widely used in endodontic therapy were transformed into bioresorbable chlorhexidine delivery systems for the treatment of the periodontal pocket by preventing its recolonization by the subgingival microflora. these paper points (pps) were first oxidized to promote their resorption, then grafted  with beta-cyclodextrin (cd) or maltodextrin (md) in order to achieve sustained delivery of chlorhexidine. we investigated the oxidation step parameters through  the time of reaction and the nitric and phosphoric acid ratios in the oxidizing mixture, and then the dextrin grafting step parameters through the time and temperature of reaction. a first selection of the appropriate functionalization parameters was undertaken in relation to the degradation profile kinetics of the  oxidized (ppo) and oxidized-grafted samples (ppo-cd and ppo-md). samples were then loaded with chlorhexidine digluconate (digchx), a widely used antiseptic agent in periodontal therapy. the release kinetics of digchx from ppo-cd and ppo-md samples were compared to pp, ppo and to periochip((r)) (a commercial digchx containing gelatine chip) in phosphate buffered saline (ph 7.4) by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. the cytocompatibility of the oxidized-grafted pp was demonstrated by cell proliferation assays. finally, the disc diffusion test from digchx loaded ppo-md samples immersed in human plasma was developed on pre-inoculated agar plates with four common periodontal pathogenic strains: fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, aggregatibacter actinomycetem comitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. to conclude, the optimized oxidized-dextrin-grafted pps responded to our initial specifications in terms of  resorption and digchx release rates and therefore could be adopted as a reliable  complementary periodontal therapy.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in fanconi's anemia patients.
AB  == fanconi's anemia (fa) is characterized by bone marrow failure and can lead to infections such as periodontal disease. the aim of this study was to compare the  prevalence of four periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola in saliva samples from children with and without fa. paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 71 children and adolescents, aged 6-18 years old. the samples were divided in three groups: fa without hsct (n = 25), fa with hsct (n = 23) and non-fa (n = 24). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. p. gingivalis was the most frequent species in all groups and t. denticola the less frequent. p. gingivalis was also common species in combinations in all groups. no statistically difference was observed between the groups for single bacteria, pair or triple combination. the combination of the four species was detected in one saliva sample of the fa without hsct group and in five samples of the non-fa  group, with statistical difference between them (p < 0.05, fisher exact test). systemic alterations found in fa subjects did not affect the salivary distribution of the four bacteria analyzed.

TI  == dna-based adaptive immunity protect host from infection-associated periodontal bone resorption via recognition of porphyromonas gingivalis virulence component.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) is one of a constellation of oral organisms associated with human chronic periodontitis. while adaptive immunity to periodontal pathogen proteins has been investigated and is an important component of periodontal bone resorption, the effect of periodontal pathogen dna in eliciting systemic and mucosal antibody and modulating immune responses has not been investigated. methods: rowett rats were locally injected with whole genomic  pg dna in alum. escherichia coli (ec) genomic dna, fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) genomic dna, and saline/alum injected rats served as controls. after various time points, serum igg and salivary iga antibody to ec, fn or pg were detected by elisa. serum and salivary antibody reactions with pg surface antigens were determined by western blot analyses and the specific antigen was identified by mass spectrometry. effects of genomic dna immunization on pg bacterial colonization and experimental periodontal bone resorption were also evaluated. results: sera from pg dna, ec dna and fn dna-injected rats did not react with ec  or fn bacteria. serum igg antibody levels to pg and pg surface extracts were significantly higher in animals immunized with pg dna as compared to the control  groups. rats injected with pg dna demonstrated a strong serum igg and salivary iga antibody reaction solely to pg fimbrillin (41kda), the major protein component of pg fimbriae. in the pg dna-immunized group, the numbers of pg bacteria in oral cavity and the extent of periodontal bone resorption were significantly reduced after pg infection. conclusions: this study suggests that infected hosts may select specific genes from whole genomic dna of the periodontal pathogen for transcription and presentation. the results indicate that the unique gene selected can initiate a host protective immune response to the parent bacterium.

TI  == quantitative analysis of periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of geriatric subjects.
AB  == purpose: at present, information regarding periodontal disease in geriatric patients is scarce. the purpose of this study was to quantify the periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of korean geriatric patients and assess the relationship between the bacterial levels and the periodontal condition. methods: six putative periodontal pathogens were quantified by using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in geriatric patient groups (>60 years) with mild chronic periodontitis (mcp), moderate chronic periodontitis (mocp), and severe chronic periodontitis (scp). the copy numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia were measured. results: it was found that the bacterial copy numbers increased as the severity of the disease increased from mcp to scp, except for p. intermedia. for p. intermedia, it was found that samples in the mcp group yielded the largest amount. it was also found that the quantities of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola, the so-called "red complex" bacteria, were lower than those of f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia in all of the samples. conclusions: collectively, the results of this study suggest that the levels of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, f. nucleatum, and t. denticola present in saliva are associated with the severity of periodontal disease in geriatric patients.

TI  == the effects of stress hormones on growth of selected periodontitis related bacteria.
AB  == the focus of this study was to examine in vitro the effects of stress hormones (catecholamines: epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine and hydrocortisone: cortisol) on the growth of four anaerobic species of periodontitis-related bacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and one facultative anaerobic species (eikenella corrodens). bacterial growth was determined by two different methods:  fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), and the viable count by culture method. to simulate stress, each single strain was grown in a special growth medium with three different concentrations of each hormone, using an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees c. growth of f. nucleatum increased in the presence of all  stress hormones. growth of p. gingivalis was not significantly influenced by any  hormone. growth of p. intermedia and e. corrodens was inhibited by almost all stress hormones tested. both methods of analysis revealed that the highest concentrations of norepinephrine and cortisol increased the growth of t. forsythia. different hormones have a different effect on the growth of periodontitis-related bacteria in vitro. it appears that bacterial viability is more strongly influenced than is bacterial metabolic activity. the growth of f. nucleatum particularly and partially of t. forsythia is increased by several stress hormones and may have an additional negative impact on periodontal disease.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis promotes invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma through induction of prommp9 and its activation.
AB  == recent epidemiological studies have revealed a significant association between periodontitis and oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc). furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp9) is implicated in the invasion and metastasis of tumour cells. we examined the involvement of porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, in oscc invasion through induced expression of prommp and its activation. prommp9 was continuously secreted from carcinoma sas cells, while p.  gingivalis infection increased proenzyme expression and subsequently processed it to active mmp9 in culture supernatant, which enhanced cellular invasion. in contrast, fusobacterium nucleatum, another periodontal organism, failed to demonstrate such activities. the effects of p. gingivalis were observed with highly invasive cells, but not with the low invasivetype. p. gingivalis also stimulated proteinase-activated receptor 2 (par2) and enhanced prommp9 expression, which promoted cellular invasion. p. gingivalis mutants deficient in  gingipain proteases failed to activate mmp9. infected sas cells exhibited activation of erk1/2, p38, and nf-kb, and their inhibitors diminished both prommp9-overexpression and cellular invasion. together, our results show that p.  gingivalis activates the erk1/2-ets1, p38/hsp27, and par2/nf-kb pathways to induce prommp9 expression, after which the proenzyme is activated by gingipains to promote cellular invasion of oscc cell lines. these findings suggest a novel mechanism of progression and metastasis of oscc associated with periodontitis.

TI  == genotype is an important determinant factor of host susceptibility to periodontitis in the collaborative cross and inbred mouse populations.
AB  == background: periodontal infection (periodontitis) is a chronic inflammatory disease, which results in the breakdown of the supporting tissues of the teeth. previous epidemiological studies have suggested that resistance to chronic periodontitis is controlled to some extent by genetic factors of the host. the aim of this study was to determine the phenotypic response of inbred and collaborative cross (cc) mouse populations to periodontal bacterial challenge, using an experimental periodontitis model. in this model, mice are co-infected with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterial strains associated with human periodontal disease. six weeks following the infection, the maxillary jaws were harvested and analyzed for alveolar bone loss relative to uninfected controls, using computerized microtomography (microct). initially, four commercial inbred mouse strains were examined to calibrate the procedure and test for gender effects. subsequently, we applied the same protocol to 23 lines (at inbreeding generations 10-18) from the newly developed mouse genetic reference population, the collaborative cross (cc) to determine heritability and  genetic variation of control bone volume prior to infection (cbv, naive bone volume around the teeth of uninfected mice), and residual bone volume (rbv, bone  volume after infection) and loss of bone volume (lbv, the difference between cbv  and rbv) following infection. results: balb/cj mice were highly susceptible (p<0.05) whereas dba/2j, c57bl/6j and a/j mice were resistant. six lines of the tested cc population were susceptible, whereas the remaining lines were resistant to alveolar bone loss. gender effects on bone volume were tested across the four  inbred and 23 cc lines, and found not to be significant. based on anova analyses, broad-sense heritabilities were statistically significant and equal to 0.4 for cbv and 0.2 for lbv. conclusions: the moderate heritability values indicate that  the variation in host susceptibility to the disease is controlled to an appreciable extent by genetic factors. these results strongly support the possibility of using the collaborative cross, as well as developing dedicated f2  (resistant x susceptible inbred strains) resource populations, for future dissection of genetic factors in periodontitis.

TI  == relationship between halitosis and periodontal disease - associated oral bacteria in tongue coatings.
AB  == aim: the objective of our study was to investigate the relationship between halitosis and oral bacteria in tongue coating (tc) and saliva samples from patients with halitosis, and to evaluate the effect of tongue cleaning on halitosis. methods: ninety-four participants complaining of oral malodour were included in the study. organoleptic (or) values, volatile sulphur compound (vsc)  concentrations determined by gas chromatography and tc scores were used as clinical parameters of halitosis. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions were used to determine the numbers of periodontal disease-associated oral bacteria. results: there was a significant correlation between tc scores and or values, methylmercaptan (ch3 sh) concentrations and vsc concentrations (spearman's rank-correlation coefficient test, p < 0.01). there was also a positive correlation between the clinical parameters of halitosis and total bacterial numbers and prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus concentrations in the tc samples. however, there was no similar correlation with respect to the saliva samples. the participants were sub-divided into two groups based on whether they had the habit of tongue cleaning or not. the participants with the habit of tongue cleaning had significantly lower or scores, vsc concentrations and p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and c. rectus levels than the other participants (mann-whitney u-test, p < 0.05). conclusion: these results suggested that periodontal disease-associated oral bacteria in tcs are closely related to halitosis and that tongue cleaning may be  an effective method for improving halitosis.

TI  == halitosis vaccines targeting foma, a biofilm-bridging protein of fusobacteria nucleatum.
AB  == halitosis (bad breath) is estimated to influence more than half of the world's population with varying degree of intensity. more than 85% of halitosis originates from oral bacterial infections. foul-smelling breath mainly results from bacterial production of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) such as hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. to date, major treatments for elimination of oral malodor include periodontal therapy combined with antibiotics or antimicrobial agents, and mechanical approaches including tooth and tongue cleaning. these treatments may transiently reduce vscs but carry risks of generating toxicity, increasing resistant strains and misbalancing the resident human flora. therefore, there is a need to develop alternative therapeutic modalities for halitosis. plaque biofilms are the principal source for generating vscs which are originally metabolized from amino acids during co-aggregation of oral bacteria. blocking the bacterial coaggregation, therefore, may prevent various biofilm-associated oral diseases such as periodontitis and halitosis. fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum), a gram-negative anaerobe oral bacterium,  is a main bacterial strain related to halitosis. aggregation of f. nucleatum with other bacteria to form plaque biofilms in oral cavity causes bad breath. foma, the major outer membrane protein of f. nucleatum, recruits other oral pathogenic  bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) in the periodontal pockets. a halitosis vaccine targeting f. bacterium foma significantly abrogates  the enhancement of bacterial co-aggregation, biofilms, production of vscs, and gum inflammation mediated by an inter-species interaction of f. nucleatum with p. gingivalis, which suggests foma of f. nucleatum to be a potential target for development of vaccines or drugs against bacterial biofilm formation and its associated pathogenicities.

AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

TI  == serum antibody responses to periodontal microbiota in chronic and aggressive periodontitis: a postulate revisited.
AB  == background: the authors revisited the 1999 international workshop postulate of robust serum antibody responses to infecting agents in localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) and weak responses in generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). antibody responses were further examined in localized and generalized chronic periodontitis (lcp and gcp). methods: the study includes 119 patients (60 males and 59 females, aged 11 to 76 years), 18 with lagp, 37 with gagp, 37 with lcp, and 27 with gcp. multiple subgingival plaque samples/patient (1,057 in total) were analyzed with respect to 11 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations, and serum immunoglobulin (ig)g levels were measured against the same bacteria using checkerboard immunoblotting. further, infection ratios (antibody level over the average bacterial colonization by the homologous  species) were computed for each patient. comparisons of bacterial colonization, serum igg levels, and infection ratios were made across the diagnostic categories using multivariable linear regression models adjusting for age and race/ethnicity. results: there were no statistically significant differences in serum igg levels to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans among the four diagnostic categories. igg levels to several species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus, were highest in patients with gagp and significantly different from lcp and gcp, but not from lagp. comparisons based on infection ratios showed no statistically significant differences for any species between gagp and lagp. conclusion: this study provides evidence against the 1999 workshop's postulate of weak serum antibody responses in patients with gagp and shows that serum igg responses in gagp are comparable to those in lagp, but higher than in gcp or lcp for several species.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and toll-like receptor 2 are associated with hypertensive disorders in placental tissue: a case-control study.
AB  == aim(s): to explore the associations between the presence of periodontal pathogens and the expression of toll-like receptors (tlr-2 and tlr-4) in the placental tissue of patients with hypertensive disorders compared to the placentas of healthy normotensive patients. material and methods: a case-control study was performed. from a cohort composed of 126 pregnant women, 33 normotensive healthy  pregnant women were randomly selected, and 25 cases of patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, were selected. placental biopsy was obtained after aseptic placental collection at the time of delivery. all of the samples were processed and analysed for the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique. determination of the expressions of tlr-2 and tlr-4 was performed in samples of total purified protein isolated from  placental tissues and analysed by elisa. the data were assessed using descriptive statistics. the associations among variables were estimated through multiple logistic regression models and the mann-whitney test to evaluate the differences  between the two groups. results: a significant increase was observed in the expression of tlr-2 in the placentas of patients with hypertensive disorders (p = 0.04). additionally, the multiple logistic regression models demonstrated an association between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis in placental tissues and hypertensive disorders (or: 9.39, p = 0.001, ci 95% 2.39-36.88 and or: 7.59, p = 0.019, ci 95% 1.39-41.51, respectively). conclusions: in the present study, pregnant women with periodontal disease presented an association in the placental tissue between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis and hypertensive disorders. additionally, increased expression of tlr-2 was observed. however, further studies are required to determine the specific roles of periodontal pathogens and tlrs in the placental tissue of patients with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.

TI  == periodontitis in pregnant baboons: systemic inflammation and adaptive immune responses and pregnancy outcomes in a baboon model.
AB  == background/objectives: chronic periodontal infections have been suggested to contribute to the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. material and methods: this  study describes the relationship of patterns of systemic inflammatory mediators and igg antibody to 20 oral bacteria in pregnant female baboons (papio anubis) coupled with clinical features of ligature-induced periodontitis, as risk indicators for adverse pregnancy outcomes. animals showing a preterm delivery and/or low birth weight newborns, as well as those pregnancies resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or fetal demise were tabulated as adverse pregnancy outcomes. results: a significantly greater frequency of the periodontitis group neonates had a low birth weight (18.1%; p = 0.008) and decreased gestational age (9.8%). spontaneous abortion/stillbirth/fetal demise were increased in the periodontitis (8.7%) versus the control group (3.8%) (p = 0.054). the baseline oral clinical presentation of the experimental animals did not relate to the adverse pregnancy outcomes. animals with the greatest extent/severity of periodontitis progression during the initial (1/2) of gestation (ie. to mid-pregnancy) had the greatest risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. baseline biological parameters indicating historical responses of the animals to periodontal challenge demonstrated individual variation in selected mediators, some of which became more differential during ligature-induced periodontitis. the relationship of clinical parameters to systemic inflammatory responses was consistent with a temporal contribution to adverse pregnancy outcomes in a subset of the animals. conclusions: these results support a link between periodontitis and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the baboons and provide a prospective experimental model for delineating the biologic parameters that contribute to a causal relationship between chronic oral infections and birth events.

TI  == subgingival root brushing in deep human periodontal pockets.
AB  == objective: the short-term clinical and microbiological effects of patient-applied subgingival root brushing were assessed on untreated deep human periodontal pockets. methods: assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total cultivable subgingival counts, and cultivable counts and proportions of six putative periodontal pathogens were carried out at baseline and after 14 days on  two contralateral > or = 6 mm bleeding interproximal posterior sites in each of 11 adults with untreated chronic periodontitis. one of the sites was randomly assigned to daily patient-applied subgingival root brushing for 14 days, and the  other to remain with the patient's pre-existing tooth brushing and flossing regimen. no other periodontal therapy was performed during the 14 test days. results: significant reductions in plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total subgingival counts, and levels of putative periodontal pathogens were found after 14 days of subgingival root brushing. subgingival root brushing nearly eliminated bleeding on probing at test sites, reduced probing depths by a mean of 1.8 mm, and reduced cultivable subgingival proportions of six evaluated putative  periodontal pathogens from a cumulative total of 14.1% to 0.8%. in comparison, no significant clinical or microbiological changes were detected after 14 days where the patient's pre-existing oral hygiene regimen remained unaltered. conclusions:  subgingival root brushing over 14 days, in properly trained patients, induced favorable clinical and microbiological changes in deep periodontal pockets > or = 6 mm even in the absence of professional subgingival debridement.

TI  == phototoxic effect of blue light on the planktonic and biofilm state of anaerobic  periodontal pathogens.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to compare the phototoxic effects of blue  light exposure on periodontal pathogens in both planktonic and biofilm cultures.  methods: strains of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis, in planktonic or biofilm states, were exposed to visible light at wavelengths of 400.520 nm. a quartz-tungsten-halogen  lamp at a power density of 500 mw/cm(2) was used for the light source. each sample was exposed to 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 seconds of each bacterial strain in  the planktonic or biofilm state. confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm) was used to observe the distribution of live/dead bacterial cells in biofilms. after  light exposure, the bacterial killing rates were calculated from colony forming unit (cfu) counts. results: clsm images that were obtained from biofilms showed a mixture of dead and live bacterial cells extending to a depth of 30-45 microm. obvious differences in the live-to-dead bacterial cell ratio were found in p. gingivalis biofilm according to light exposure time. in the planktonic state, almost all bacteria were killed with 60 seconds of light exposure to f. nucleatum (99.1%) and with 15 seconds to p. gingivalis (100%). in the biofilm state, however, only the cfu of p. gingivalis demonstrated a decreasing tendency with increasing light exposure time, and there was a lower efficacy of phototoxicity to p. gingivalis as biofilm than in the planktonic state. conclusions: blue light exposure using a dental halogen curing unit is effective in reducing periodontal  pathogens in the planktonic state. it is recommended that an adjunctive exogenous photosensitizer be used and that pathogens be exposed to visible light for clinical antimicrobial periodontal therapy.

TI  == no evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  == background and objective: there is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (tcs)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to tcs toothpaste. therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to tcs in toothpaste selects for tcs-resistant bacteria within the oral  biofilm. material and methods: dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. participants had been randomly assigned to use tcs (3000 mug/ml tcs) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n  = 22). diluted plaque samples were plated on to wilkins-chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and tcs (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees c under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing and tcs minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined for each isolate. results: at 3000 mug/ml tcs no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. the mics of tcs for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/ml in both groups. species common to both groups had similar mics. veillonella parvula and campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar mics in both groups. conclusion: the use of tcs-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in mic of tcs of oral bacterial isolates.

TI  == oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of ll-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == some agents, including escherichia coli and group a streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. ll-37 is a human host defence peptide shown  previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. however, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of ll-37 remains obscure. in order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on ll-37's activity against e. coli and s. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly  used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (porphyromonas gingivalis and  fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates  as indicated by the growth curves generated. the sensitivities of e. coli and s.  pyogenes to ll-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. the oxygen facultative e. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to ll-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. the microaerophilic pathogen s. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to ll-37 under oxygen deprivation. our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.

TI  == validation of antibiotic efficacy on in vitro subgingival biofilms.
AB  == background: systemic antibiotics are often used as adjunctive treatment modalities for periodontal diseases. testing of antimicrobial efficacy can be relevant only if the bacteria are in the form of biofilms rather than the planktonic state, and at concentrations of physiologic relevance, i.e., reachable in the periodontal pocket. the aim of the present study is to test the antimicrobial efficacy of five common antibiotic schemes at physiologically relevant concentrations on a multispecies in vitro biofilm model. methods: a 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model was exposed to metronidazole (15 mug/ml), amoxicillin (15 mug/ml), metronidazole and amoxicillin in combination, doxycycline (2 mug/ml), and azithromycin (10 mug/ml) over 24 hours. species-specific bacterial numbers were determined by culture on selective agar media or by epifluorescence microscopy. results: metronidazole alone did not affect biofilm composition. total bacterial counts were significantly reduced by  doxycycline, azithromycin, and amoxicillin alone or in combination with metronidazole, albeit by less than 1 log. on the species-specific level, these regimens significantly reduced the numbers of streptococcus anginosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as campylobacter rectus (except for amoxicillin alone). the strongest effects were displayed by the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: antibiotics at concentrations detectable in gingival crevicular fluid do not dramatically reduce total bacterial loads in this in vitro biofilm model, but cause species-specific  reductions, which may disrupt the biofilm unity.

TI  == the microbiology of the peri-implant sulcus following successful implantation of  oral prosthetic treatments.
AB  == background: oral implants are widely used in partially and fully edentulous patients; however, the integration of an implant can be endangered by factors such as intraoral bacteria or inflammatory reactions. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial flora present in the sulcus around dental implants  and to assess the relationship between gingival health and microbial flora present. materials and methods: twenty patients who had received oral implants with no complications were followed for a period of 9 months. assessment of probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing and microbial sampling from the peri-implant sulcus were performed at three different time points- 4 weeks after surgery, 1 month and 6 months after loading. the samples were taken by paper points and transferred to the microbiology lab in thioglyocolate cultures.  in order to do a colony count and isolate the aerobic capnophilic and anerobic bacteria the samples were cultured and incubated on laboratory media. the colonies were also identified using various diagnostic tests. alterations in the  presence of various bacterial species over time and gum health were tested using  analysis of variance (anova) with tukey's test post hoc. results: the average pocket depth for each patient ranged from 1.37 +/- 0.39 mm to 2.55 +/- 0.72 mm. the bacteria isolated from the cultured samples included aerobic, facultative anerobic, obligate anerobic and capnophilic bacteria. conclusion: the anerobic conditions created in the peri-implant sulcus might with time enhance the number  of anerobic bacteria present following dental implant loading.

AB  == objective: to assess the short-term effect of scaling and root planing (srp) and  essential-oils mouthwash on the levels of specific bacteria in chinese adults. methods: fifty chinese adults with chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to full-mouth srp or a 7-d essential-oils mouthwash regimen. in addition, 22 periodontally healthy adults used essential-oils mouthwash for 7 d. clinical examination and plaque/saliva sampling were performed at baseline and on day 7. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to measure aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), and total bacterial loads in saliva, supra- and sub-gingival plaque samples. results: the detection frequencies of four tested species remained unchanged after either treatment. however, the bacterial loads of fn, pg, and pi were significantly reduced by srp; the mean reduction of bacterial counts in saliva ranged from 52.2% to 62.5% (p<0.01), in supragingival plaque from 68.2% to 81.0% (p<0.05), and in subgingival plaque from 67.9% to 93.0% (p<0.01). total bacterial loads were reduced after srp in supra- and sub-gingival plaque (p<0.05). essential-oils mouthwash reduced fn levels in supragingival plaque by a mean of 53.2%, and reduced total bacterial loads in supra- and sub-gingival plaque (p<0.01). in subgingival plaque from periodontal patients, pg and pi reductions were high after srp compared to essential-oils mouthwash (93.0% vs. 37.7% and 87.0% vs. 21.0%, p<0.05). no significant bacterial reduction was observed in periodontally  healthy subjects using essential-oils mouthwash. conclusions: srp and essential-oils mouthwash both have an impact on saliva and gingival plaque flora  in chinese periodontitis patients in 7 d, with greater microbiological improvement by srp.

TI  == the protective effect of recombinant foma-expressing lactobacillus acidophilus against periodontal infection.
AB  == a number of studies have shown that the outer membrane protein foma found in fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrates great potential as an immune target for combating periodontitis. lactobacillus acidophilus is a useful antigen delivery vehicle for mucosal immunisation, and previous studies by our group have shown that l. acidophilus acts as a protective factor in periodontal health. in this study, making use of the immunogenicity of foma and the probiotic properties of l. acidophilus, we constructed a recombinant form of l. acidophilus expressing the foma protein and detected the foma-specific igg in the serum and siga in the  saliva of mice through oral administration with the recombinant strains. when serum containing foma-specific antibodies was incubated with the f. nucleatum in  vitro, the number of porphyromonas gingivalis cells that coaggregated with the f. nucleatum cells was significantly reduced. furthermore, a mouse gum abscess model was successfully generated, and the range of gingival abscesses in the immune mice was relatively limited compared with the control group. the level of il-1beta in the serum and local gum tissues of the immune mice was consistently lower than in the control group. our findings indicated that oral administration  of the recombinant l. acidophilus reduced the risk of periodontal infection with  p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens in amniotic fluid and the role of periodontal disease in pre-term birth and low birth weight.
AB  == background: pre-term birth and/or low birth weight (ptlbw) is a serious problem in developing countries. the absence of known risk factors in approximately 50% of ptlbw cases has resulted in a continued search for other causes. the aim of this study was to examine the effect of periodontitis on pregnancy outcomes. methods: samples were taken from 50 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis. polymerase chain reaction was performed on amniotic fluid samples obtained during amniocentesis and on subgingival plaque samples to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia,  campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens. plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level were evaluated.  medical records were obtained after birth. results: social and demographic variables were similar among the gingivitis (g), localized periodontitis (lp) and generalized periodontitis (gp) groups. four subjects gave birth to ptlbw neonates. campylobacter rectus, t. forsythia, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were detected in the amniotic fluid and subgingival plaque samples of three patients who gave birth to ptlbw neonates. the amniotic fluid sample from the fourth patient was not positive for any of the tested pathogens. conclusion: these findings suggest that the transmission of some periodontal pathogens from the oral cavity of the mother may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. the results contribute to an understanding of the association between periodontal disease and ptlbw, but further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship.

TI  == mobile microbiome: oral bacteria in extra-oral infections and inflammation.
AB  == the link between oral infections and adverse systemic conditions has attracted much attention in the research community. several mechanisms have been proposed,  including spread of the oral infection due to transient bacteremia resulting in bacterial colonization in extra-oral sites, systemic injury by free toxins of oral pathogens, and systemic inflammation caused by soluble antigens of oral pathogens. mounting evidence supports a major role of the systemic spread of oral commensals and pathogens to distant body sites causing extra-oral infections and  inflammation. we review here the most recent findings on systemic infections and  inflammation complicated by oral bacteria, including cardiovascular disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and  colorectal cancer, respiratory tract infections, and organ inflammations and abscesses. the recently identified virulence mechanisms of oral species fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and campylobacter rectus are also reviewed. a pattern emerges indicating that only select subtype(s) of a given species, e.g., f. nucleatum subspecies animalis and  polymorphum and s. mutans non-c serotypes, are prone to extra-oral translocation. these findings advocate the importance of identification and quantification of potential pathogens at the subtype levels for accurate prediction of disease potential.

AB  == background: the mechanism of action of adjuvant antibiotic therapy in the treatment of peri-implantitis is not well understood. the aim of this study is to investigate antibiotic susceptibility of an in vitro biofilm by isothermal microcalorimetry (imc). methods: titanium disks containing a 72-hour three-species biofilm (streptococcus sanguinis dsm20068, fusobacterium nucleatum  atcc10953, and porphyromonas gingivalis dsm20709) were placed in a series of imc  ampoules with nutrient agar supplemented with increasing concentrations of amoxicillin, metronidazole, or their combination and incubated anaerobically for  10 days. lag time and maximum growth rate were determined from continuous heat-flow recordings of metabolic activity. to validate the imc biofilm results,  adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis were incubated anaerobically in medium supplemented with antibiotics at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, and their vitality was determined by live/dead staining, conventional culturing, and imc. results: in all biofilm samples incubated with antibiotics, a prolonged lag phase was observed compared with controls (p <0.05). maximum growth rate was significantly  lower for samples treated with either amoxicillin or metronidazole compared with  controls (p <0.05). combining the antibiotics did not improve this effect. concentrations exceeding 10 times the minimum inhibitory concentration completely inhibited the growth of adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis, whereas lower concentrations resulted in only a delay in the lag phase. a poor correlation was  observed between live/dead staining and conventional culturing. conclusions: imc  gives new evidence about antibiotic effects on oral biofilms and is more informative than conventional culture and live/dead assays. the combination of antibiotics was found to be more efficient than metronidazole alone; however, only minor differences in growth inhibition were detected compared with amoxicillin alone.

TI  == suppression of t-cell chemokines by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen in periodontal disease and is associated with immune dysbiosis. in this study, we found that p. gingivalis did  not induce the expression of the t-cell chemokine ip-10 (cxcl10) from neutrophils, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs), or gingival epithelial cells. furthermore, p. gingivalis suppressed gamma interferon (ifn-gamma)-stimulated release of ip-10, itac (cxcl11), and mig (cxcl9) from epithelial cells and inhibited ip-10 secretion in a mixed infection with the otherwise stimulatory fusobacterium nucleatum. inhibition of chemokine expression occurred at the level of gene transcription and was associated with downregulation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (irf-1) and decreased levels of  stat1. ectopic expression of irf-1 in epithelial cells relieved p. gingivalis-induced inhibition of ip-10 release. direct contact between p. gingivalis and epithelial cells was not required for ip-10 inhibition. these results highlight the immune-disruptive potential of p. gingivalis. suppression of ip-10 and other th1-biasing chemokines by p. gingivalis may perturb the balance of protective and destructive immunity in the periodontal tissues and facilitate the pathogenicity of oral microbial communities.

AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == host susceptibility to periodontitis: mapping murine genomic regions.
AB  == host susceptibility to periodontal infection is controlled by genetic factors. as a step toward identifying and cloning these factors, we generated an a/j x balb/cj f2 mouse resource population. a genome-wide search for quantitative trait loci (qtl) associated with periodontitis was performed. we aimed to quantify the  phenotypic response of the progenies to periodontitis by microct analysis, to perform a genome-wide search for qtl associated with periodontitis, and, finally, to suggest candidate genes for periodontitis. we were able to produce 408 f2 mice. all mice were co-infected with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum bacteria. six weeks following infection, alveolar bone loss was quantified by computerized tomography (microct) technology. we found normal distribution of the phenotype, with 2 highly significant qtl on chromosomes 5 and 3. a third significant qtl was found on chromosome 1. candidate genes were suggested, such as toll-like receptors (tlr) 1 and 6, chemokines, and bone-remodeling genes (enamelin, ameloblastin, and amelotin). this report shows that periodontitis in mice is a polygenic trait with highly significant mapped qtl.

TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == antibacterial effect of different root canal sealers on three bacterial species.
AB  == objective: bacteria persisting in the root canal system may thwart endodontic therapy. it is therefore interesting to know whether clinically available root canal sealers have an antimicrobial effect. the objective of the present in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of various sealers on the endodontologically detectable species enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). methods: the antibacterial effectiveness of the sealers was tested by means of the agar diffusion test (adt) and the direct contact test (dct). eight different sealers (ah plus((r)), hermetic((r)), roekoseal((r)), sealapex((r)), apexit plus((r)), 2seal((r)), endorez((r)) and proroot mta((r))) and two temporary sealers (calxyl((r)) and gangraena merz((r))) were tested. at first, 100mul of bacterial suspension (bs) of each individual micro-organism (optical density (od) 0.5) was applied separately to schaedler agar plates for the adt. subsequently, freshly mixed and set sealer was applied. after 48h of incubation, the inhibition zones were measured. further, 18mg of sealer were put  into each well of 48-well cell culture plates and overlaid with 400mul of schaedler liquid medium and 100mul of bs (od 0.5) in monoculture. bacterial growth was determined by the dct from the optical density of the liquid by photospectrometry after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24h. results: for the application, the sealer hermetic((r)), a significant suppression of the species e. faecalis, f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis was detected in both the adt and the dct. ah plus((r)) showed a suppressive effect on e. faecalis and f. nucleatum in the dct. with all other sealers tested, e. faecalis was not suppressible. roekoseal((r)),  calxyl((r)) and gangraena-merz((r)) showed no antibacterial effect on the tested  species whatsoever. significance: we have shown in both adt and dct that some root canal sealers suppress the growth of e. faecalis in vitro.

TI  == antibacterial activity of essential oils against periodontal pathogens: a qualitative systematic review.
AB  == periodontal diseases are among the most common infectious diseases that lead to the destruction of periodontal tissues. anaerobic gram-negative bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomecetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum...) isolated from periodontal lesions, have been shown to be related to the onset and progression of periodontal disease. given the incidence of periodontitis, increased resistance of oral bacteria to antibiotics and adverse effects of some antibacterial agents currently used in dentistry, there is a need for alternative products that are safe and effective, for prevention and treatment of these diseases. essential oils considered traditional medicines are  viewed as good alternatives. in morocco, a wide producer of essential oils, the high prevalence of aggressive periodontitis, related to virulent periodontal bacteria isolated from pockets in moroccan adolescents and because of the reasons evoked above, the search of a new natural agent has become a necessity. in this qualitative systematic review, the virulence and increased antibiotic resistance  of periopathogens, involved in periodontitis, will be exposed, justifying the use of alternative natural agents such as essential oils-based. studies that have investigated the efficacy of such plant-derived medicines on periodontal pathogens will be described and discussed.

TI  == peptides: beta-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds as highly effective antimicrobial and anti-epithelial proliferation agents.
AB  == background: the use of antimicrobial peptides (amps) as therapeutic agents for periodontal infections has great advantages, such as broad spectrum of action, low toxicity, and limited bacterial resistance. however, their practical use is limited because of the large amount of peptide required to exercise the microbicidal function. methods: lyetxi, ll37f, and kr12 cationic peptides were prepared with beta-cyclodextrin (betacd) at 1:1 molar ratios. the susceptibility  of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum were assessed in anaerobic conditions. cytotoxicity assays were performed using osteoblast and caco-2 epithelial cells, and hemolytic activity was assessed on rabbit erythrocytes at an absorbance of 414 nm. parameters of surface roughness and electrical charge were established by atomic  force microscopy and zeta (zeta) potential, respectively. results: amp/betacds drastically decreased the peptide concentration required for activity against the bacteria tested. moreover, amps associated with betacd were able to modify cell-surface parameters, such as roughness and zeta potential. on the other hand, amp/betacd did not alter the degree of hemolysis induced by the pure amps. the effective concentration at half-maximum values of the peptides and compounds on osteoblasts were greater than the concentrations required to achieve inhibition of bacterial growth in all the species tested. amp/betacds inhibited the proliferation of caco-2 epithelial cells in a more efficient manner than amps alone. conclusion: amp/betacd compounds more effectively inhibit periodontopathogenic bacteria than amps alone, with the additional ability of inhibiting the proliferation of epithelial cells at concentrations that are non-cytotoxic for osteoblasts and erythrocytes.

TI  == subgingival bacterial burden in relation to clinical and radiographic periodontal parameters.
AB  == background: this cross-sectional study characterizes the association between subgingival bacterial profile and periodontal parameters in patients assigned to  coronary angiography because of cardiologic problems, which may affect the oral microbiota. methods: pooled subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 477 dentate individuals during the oral examinations, along with periodontal probing  depth (pd) and assessments of bleeding on probing (bop) and radiographic alveolar bone loss (abl). the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay was used to determine the levels of 29 oral bacteria, which were divided into three bacterial complexes. results: all bacterial combinations from the etiologic bacterial group and each species from the red complex were significantly associated (p <0.001) with grade of abl. the prevalence of the etiologic bacterial group and the level  of each species were also associated strongly with the proportion of sites with pd 4 to 5 mm and >/= 6 mm, bop, and abl, except aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. levels of gram-negative oral bacteria correlated significantly with those of gram-positive species (r = 0.840, p <0.001). in multiple logistic regression analysis, the prevalence of the etiologic bacterial  group, levels of gram-negative bacteria and treponema denticola, and the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola associated significantly  with abl, whereas other bacterial complexes and levels of gram-positive species did not. conclusions: although levels of gram-negative and -positive species paralleled periodontal parameters, only the species considered etiologic were associated with abl.

TI  == clinical outcome of a nonsurgical and surgical treatment protocol in different types of peri-implantitis: a case series.
AB  == objective: the replacement of missing teeth with dental implants has been standard practice in dentistry for many years. the success of dental implants depends on many factors, among which the diagnosis, clinical severity, and treatment of peri-implant diseases play a key role. in this prospective case series, the influence of cumulative treatment modalities on peri-implantitis with and without pus formation on clinical outcome was assessed. method and materials: during 2010, 28 patients were referred for peri-implantitis treatment. they presented two different types of peri-implant diseases: peri-implantitis with (17 implants) or without pus formation (33 implants). after microbiologic diagnosis,  all patients were treated at baseline with full-mouth scaling and root planing. two months later, further full-mouth scaling and root planing and additional antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) was applied. four months after baseline, patients with pus formation additionally underwent access flap surgery. active human matrix metalloproteinase-8 (ammp-8) levels were measured in eluates  before and after all treatment modalities and 7 months after baseline. results: clinical parameters (probing depth, bleeding on probing) and ammp-8-levels improved in both groups after treatment and the final examination. in periimplantitis patients without pus formation, all parameters decreased after full-mouth scaling and root planing and the additional apdt and no surgery was necessary to improve the parameters. in patients with pus formation, the parameters decreased only after access flap surgery. conclusion: the presence of  pus influences the clinical outcome of the treatment of peri-implant diseases. whereas peri-implantitis cases without pus formation can be successfully managed  nonsurgically, peri-implantitis with pus formation can be effectively treated after an additional observation time of 3 months postoperatively only with additional flap surgery.

TI  == a molecular survey of a captive wallaby population for periodontopathogens and the co-incidence of fusobacterium necrophorum subspecies necrophorum with periodontal diseases.
AB  == periodontal diseases (pd) are diseases of polymicrobial aetiology and constitute  major health problems in captive macropods. increasing knowledge of the causal pathogens is therefore crucial for effective management and prevention of these diseases. pcr survey and sequence analyses of potential periodontopathogens in captive wallaby populations revealed a co-incidence of the diseases with the detection of fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. necrophorum (fnn) and its encoded leukotoxin (lkta) gene. sequence analyses showed that the outer membrane protein  of fnn in the genbank database shared significant homology (99%) with the fnn encoded haemagglutinin-related-protein gene fragment identified in this study. in addition, this report suggests the existence of a variant of fnn with no detectable lkta gene and thus warrants further studies. in contrast to reports associating porphyromonas gingivalis and f. nucleatum with pd, this study revealed that pd in macropods are associated with porphyromonas gulae and fnn and raises the question: is there a possible host pathogen co-evolution in the pathogenesis of pd in animals and humans? these findings contribute to the understanding of the aetiology of periodontal disease in macropods as well as opening up a new direction of research into the microbial interactions involved in the pathogenesis of pd in macropods.

TI  == characterization of extracellular polymeric matrix, and treatment of fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms with dnase i and proteinase k.
AB  == background: biofilms are organized communities of microorganisms embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix (epm), often with great phylogenetic variety. bacteria in the subgingival biofilm are key factors that cause periodontal diseases; among these are the gram-negative bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. the objectives of this study were to characterize the major components of the epm and to test the effect of deoxyribonuclease i (dnase i) and proteinase k. methods: f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis bacterial cells were grown in dynamic and static biofilm models. the effects of dnase i and proteinase k enzymes on the major components of the epm were tested during biofilm formation and on mature biofilm. confocal laser scanning microscopy was used in observing biofilm structure. results: proteins and carbohydrates were the major components of the biofilm matrix, and extracellular dna (edna) was also present. dnase i and proteinase k enzymes had little effect on biofilms in the conditions used. in the flow cell, f. nucleatum  was able to grow in partially oxygenated conditions while p. gingivalis failed to form biofilm alone in similar conditions. f. nucleatum supported the growth of p. gingivalis when they were grown together as dual species biofilm. conclusion: dnase i and proteinase k had little effect on the biofilm matrix in the conditions used. f. nucleatum formed biofilm easily and supported the growth of p. gingivalis, which preferred anaerobic conditions.

AB  == objectives: the aim of the study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of a mouth rinse containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride (mr1) with a stannous fluoride-based mouth rinse (mr2) in vitro. materials and methods: samples of the tongues from 10 subjects with and 10 subjects without halitosis were inoculated on blood agar plates. the agar was perforated, and the cylindrical holes were filled either with mouth rinse mr1 or with mouth rinse mr2. after incubation, inhibition zones of the whole tongue microbiota and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured. in addition, mr1 and mr2 were applied in a short interval killing test (sikt) on four oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, f. nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. total viable cell counts were made after two minutes of incubation with increasing concentrations of mr1 and mr2. results: mr1 showed a significantly higher in vitro antimicrobial activity against the whole tongue microbiota and f. nucleatum than mr2 in both groups of subjects. in the sik test, mr1 showed a significantly greater killing capacity than mr2. the results show that a mouth rinse with low concentrations of chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride appears to be more effective in inhibiting growth of the human tongue microbiota in vitro than a fluoride/stannous fluoride-containing mouth rinse. conclusion: this in vitro observation supports the use of chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride in the treatment of oral halitosis.

TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI  == characteristics of porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in co-culture with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is associated with chronic periodontitis and forms multi-species biofilms. they can communicate within species as well as with other species found in the subgingiva, which may induce changes in the growth ratio and virulence of periodontopathogens. the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of p. gingivalis shows different virulence by growth condition. the purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of p. gingivalis lps when co-cultured with fusobacterium nucleatum. after culture of p. gingivalis in the presence or absence of f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis lps was extracted. thp-1 cells were treated with the lps and induction of cytokine expression was investigated using  real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). for the analysis of p. gingivalis lps, lps biosynthesis-related genes such as lpxa and lpxd were evaluated with real-time rt-pcr. finally, molecular mass of lipid a was measured by mass spectrometry after hydrolysis of the lps. co-cultured p. gingivalis lps exhibited higher induction of expression of interleukin 1beta, 6, and 8 than single-cultured p. gingivalis lps. these symptoms may be caused by an increase in m/z 1689 lipid a through the upregulation of lpxa and lpxd expression by communication between p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == virulence mechanism of bacteria in mixed infection: attenuation of cytokine levels and evasion of polymorphonuclear leukocyte phagocytosis.
AB  == background: the objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of bacterial viability on the virulence of mixed infection. methods: expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [il]-1beta and il-10, respectively) was tested in vivo, following live versus heat-killed infection (mono or mixed), using the mouse chamber model of infection. ex vivo, phagocytosis of fluorescently labeled bacteria was tested in primary mouse polymorphonuclear leukocytes by flow cytometry. results: in monoinfection, heat-killed porphyromonas gingivalis led to augmented levels of il-1beta 2 hours  postinfection, whereas il-10 levels remained unaffected. phagocytosis of heat-killed p. gingivalis was reduced compared with that of the live p. gingivalis, whereas phagocytosis of heat-killed fusobacterium nucleatum was augmented compared with that of live f. nucleatum. in mixed infection, both il-1beta and il-10 levels were augmented 24 hours postinfection when the bacteria were heat-killed. although the phagocytosis pattern of f. nucleatum in the mixed  infection remained similar to that upon monoinfection, phagocytosis of p. gingivalis was reduced following mixed infection. conclusions: the inflammatory response to live mixed infection is attenuated with reduced phagocytosis, compared with that of heat-killed mixed infection. the lower response to live mixed infection could stem from a mechanism enabling the bacteria to evade the host response, thereby increasing bacterial survival.

TI  == evidence supporting a protective role for th9 and th22 cytokines in human and experimental periapical lesions.
AB  == introduction: the development of periapical granulomas is dependent on the host response and involves th1, th2, th17, and treg-related cytokines. the discovery of new th9 and th22 subsets, with important immunomodulatory roles mediated by interleukin (il)-9 and il-22, respectively, emphasizes the need for reevaluation  of current cytokine paradigms in context of periapical lesions. we investigated the expression of il-9 and il-22 in active and stable human granulomas and throughout experimental lesion development in mice. methods: periapical granulomas (n = 83) and control specimens (n = 24) were evaluated regarding the expression of il-9 and il-22 via real-time polymerase chain reaction. experimental periapical lesions were induced in mice (pulp exposure and bacterial inoculation) and the lesions evolution correlation with il-9 and il-22 expression kinetics was evaluated. results: il-9 and il-22 mrna expression was higher in periapical lesions than in control samples; higher levels of il-9 and il-22 were  observed in inactive than in active lesions. in the experimental lesions model, increasing levels of il-9 and il-22 mrna were detected in the lesions, and inverse correlations were found between il-9 and il-22 and the increase of lesion area in the different time point intervals. conclusions: our results suggest that th9 and th22 pathways may contribute to human and experimental periapical lesion  stability.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity  against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings  suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral  lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.

AB  == background: the aim of this study was to optimize quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for 8 major periodontal pathogens, i.e. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tanerella forsythia and  treponema denticola, and of the caries pathogen streptococcus mutans. results: eighteen different primer pairs were analyzed in silico regarding specificity (using blast analysis) and the presence of secondary structures at primer binding sites (using mfold). the most specific and efficiently binding primer pairs, according to these analyses, were selected for qpcr-analysis to determine amplification efficiency, limit of quantification and intra-run reproducibility.  for the selected primer pairs, one for each species, the specificity was confirmed by assessing amplification of dna extracts from isolates of closely related species. for these primer pairs, the intercycler portability was evaluated on 3 different thermal cyclers (the applied biosystems 7300, the bio-rad iq5 and the roche light cycler 480). for all assays on the different cyclers, a good correlation of the standard series was obtained (i.e. r2 >/= 0.98), but quantification limits varied among cyclers. the overall best quantification limit was obtained by using a 2 mul sample in a final volume of 10 mul on the light cycler 480. conclusions: in conclusion, the proposed assays allow to quantify the bacterial loads of s. mutans, 6 periodontal pathogenic species and the genus fusobacterium.this can be of use in assessing periodontal risk, determination of the optimal periodontal therapy and evaluation of this treatment.

TI  == effects of cranberry components on human aggressive periodontitis gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == background and objective: aggressive periodontitis (agp) causes rapid periodontal breakdown involving agp gingival fibroblast production of cytokines [i.e. interleukin (il)-6, a bone metabolism regulator], and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-3. lipopolysaccharide upregulates fibroblast il-6 and mmp-3, via transcription factors (i.e. nf-kappab). cranberry (vaccinium macrocarpon) inhibits lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage and normal gingival fibroblast  activities, but little is known of its effects on agp fibroblasts. objectives of  this study are to use agp fibroblasts, to determine cytotoxicity of cranberry components or periodontopathogen (fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis) lipopolysaccharide +/- cranberry components, and effects of cranberry components on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated nf-kappab activation and il-6 and mmp-3 production. material and methods: agp fibroblasts were incubated </= 6 d with high molecular weight non-dialyzable material (ndm) (derived from cranberry  juice (1-500 mug/ml) or lipopolysaccharide (1 mug/ml) +/- ndm. membrane damage and viability were assessed by enzyme activity released into cell supernatants and activity of a mitochondrial enzyme, respectively. secreted il-6 and mmp-3 were measured by elisa. nf-kappab p65 was measured via binding to an oligonucleotide containing the nf-kappab consensus site. data were analyzed using analysis of variance and scheffe's f procedure for post hoc comparisons. results: short-term exposure to ndm, or lipopolysaccharide +/- ndm caused no membrane damage. ndm (</= 100 mug/ml) or lipopolysaccharide +/- ndm had no effect on viability </= 7 d exposure. ndm (50 mug/ml) inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated p65 (p </= 0.003) and constitutive or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mmp-3 (p </= 0.02). ndm increased agp fibroblast constitutive or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated il-6 (p </= 0.0001), but inhibited  normal human gingival fibroblast il-6 (p </= 0.01). conclusion: lack of toxicity  of low ndm concentrations, and its inhibition of nf-kappab and mmp-3, suggest that cranberry components may regulate agp fibroblast inflammatory responses. distinct effects of ndm on agp and gingival fibroblast production of il-6 (which  can have both positive and negative effects on bone metabolism) may reflect phenotypic differences in il-6 regulation in the two cell types.

TI  == association between periodontal status and pre-term and/or low-birth weight in spain: clinical and microbiological parameters.
AB  == background and objective: studies performed over the last 15 years have suggested that periodontal diseases may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. however, this association has not been found in all populations. the aim of this  study was to evaluate whether periodontal status and the presence of specific periodontal pathogens may influence the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes.  material and methods: pregnant women were clinically examined before 26th week of gestation, and divided in two groups: non-periodontitis and periodontitis. microbial samples were obtained in the periodontitis group and processed by anaerobic culturing. after delivery, data on the pregnancy outcome were taken; mother's socio-demographic and risk factors were obtained at inclusion. simple and multiple regression analysis were performed. results: one hundred and seventy women were included in the study (116 non-periodontitis and 54 with periodontitis). the incidence of preterm (ptb) and low-birth weight (lbw) was 2.94% and 3.53%, respectively. periodontal status did not show any association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. the presence of eikenella corrodens was significantly related to ptb (p = 0.022) and the presence capnocytophaga spp. was related to lbw (p = 0.008). the multivariate analyses showed a significant association between ptb and newborn weight and counts of e. corrodens. maternal health and counts of e. corrodens were significantly associated with ptb or lbw.  conclusion: the clinical periodontal condition was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in a spanish caucasian population with medium-high educational level. the presence and counts of e. corrodens and the presence of capnocytophaga spp. showed a significant association with ptb and lbw, respectively, in the bivariate and/or multivariate model.

TI  == antibacterial activity of myristica fragrans against oral pathogens.
AB  == myristica fragrans houtt is mostly cultivated for spices in penang island, malaysia. the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of flesh, mace and seed of myristica fragrans was evaluated the bactericidal potential against three gram-positive cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus mitis atcc 6249, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419) and three gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522, porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586). antibacterial activities of the extracts was determined by twofold serial microdilution, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.25 to  640 mg/ml and 0.075 to 40 mg/ml. the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was obtained by subculturing method. among all extracts tested, ethyl acetate extract of flesh has the highest significant inhibitory effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with mean mic value ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml; p = 0.017) and highest bactericidal effects at mean mbc value ranging from 0.625 mg/ml to 20 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml. while for seed and mace of myristica  fragrans, their ethanol extracts exhibited good antibacterial activity against both groups of test pathogens compared to its ethyl acetate extracts. all of the  extracts of myristica fragrans did not show any antibacterial activities against  fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586. thus, our study showed the potential effect of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed and mace of myristica fragrans to be new natural agent that can be incorporated in oral care products.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis entry into gingival epithelial cells modulated by fusobacterium nucleatum is dependent on lipid rafts.
AB  == host cell invasion by a major periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis, has been proposed as an important mechanism involved in host-pathogen interactions in periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. the present study sought to gain insight into the underlying mechanism(s) involved in previously demonstrated fusobacterial modulation of host cell invasion by p. gingivalis. an immortalized  human gingival cell line ca9-22 was dually infected with p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and fusobacterium nucleatum tdc 100, and intracellular invasion was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm). sem observation showed that p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum formed consortia and were in the process of penetrating into ca9-22 by 30-60 min after infection. in cslm, ca9-22 cells that contained both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were frequently observed after 2 h, although cells that contained exclusively p. gingivalis were also found. infection by p. gingivalis and/or f. nucleatum revealed evident colocalization with a lipid raft marker, gm1-containing membrane microdomains. in an antibiotic protection assay, depletion of epithelial plasma membrane cholesterol resulted in a significant reduction of recovered p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum ( approximately 33% of untreated control; p < 0.001).  this inhibition was also confirmed by cslm. sequential infection experiments showed that timing of infection by each species could critically influence the invasion profile. co-infection with f. nucleatum significantly enhanced host cell invasion by p. gingivalis 33277, its serine phophatase serb mutant and complemented strains, suggesting that the serb does not play a major role in this fusobacterial enhancement of p. gingivalis invasion. thus, the interaction between f. nucleatum and host cells may be important in the fusobacterial enhancement of p. gingivalis invasion. collectively, these results suggest that lipid raft-mediated process is at least one of the potential mechanisms involved  in fusobacterium-modulated host cell invasion by p. gingivalis.

TI  == protective potential of non-dialyzable material fraction of cranberry juice on the virulence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum mixed infection.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a polymicrobial infectious disease. a novel potential chemical treatment modality may lie in bacterial anti-adhesive materials, such as cranberry juice fractions. the aim of this study is to explore the effect of high molecular weight cranberry constituent (non-dialyzable material [ndm]) on the virulence of a mixed infection with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in mice. methods: in vitro, the anti-adhesive property of ndm was validated on epithelial cell culture, and inhibition of coaggregation was tested using a coaggregation assay. the in vivo effect was tested on the outcome of experimental periodontitis induced by a p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum mixed infection, and also on the local host response  using the subcutaneous chamber model of infection. phagocytosis was also tested on raw macrophages by the use of fluorescent-labeled bacteria. results: ndm was found to inhibit the adhesion of both species of bacteria onto epithelial cells and to inhibit coaggregation in a dose-dependent manner. ndm consumption by mice  attenuated the severity of experimental periodontitis compared with a mixed infection without ndm treatment. in infected subcutaneous chambers, ndm alone reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels induced by the mixed infection. in vitro, ndm eliminated tnf-alpha expression by macrophages that were exposed to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, without impairing their viability. furthermore, ndm increased the phagocytosis of p. gingivalis. conclusions: the results indicate that the use of ndm may hold potential protective and/or preventive modalities in periodontal disease. underlying mechanisms for this trait may perhaps be the anti-adhesive properties of ndm or its potential effect  on inflammation.

TI  == genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == proteomics of streptococcus gordonii within a model developing oral microbial community.
AB  == background: streptococcus gordonii is one of several species that can initiate the formation of oral biofilms that develop into the complex multispecies microbial communities referred to as dental plaque. it is in the context of dental plaque that periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis cause disease. we have previously reported a whole cell quantitative proteomics investigation of p. gingivalis in a model dental plaque community of s. gordonii, p. gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. here we report the adaptation of s. gordonii to the same model. results: 1122 s. gordonii proteins were detected in s. gordonii control samples, 915 in communities with f. nucleatum, 849 with p. gingivalis, and 649 with all three organisms. quantitative comparisons showed extensive proteome changes in association with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis individually or both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum together. the changes were species specific, though the p. gingivalis interaction may be dominant, indicated by large differences between the proteomes with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis but limited changes between communities with p. gingivalis or both p. gingivalis and  f. nucleatum. the results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david. extensive changes were seen in nutrition pathways with increases in energy metabolism and changes in the resulting byproducts, while the acid and sugar repressed pts (phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system) sugar transport systems showed decreases. these results were seen across  all the multispecies samples, though with different profiles according to the partner species. f. nucleatum association decreased proteins for the metabolic end products acetate and ethanol but increased lactate, the primary source of acidity from streptococcal cultures. p. gingivalis containing samples had a reduction in levels of proteins for ethanol and formate but increased proteins for both acetate and lactate production. the communities also showed increases in exopolysaccharide synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and oxidative stress protection and decreases in adhesion and transporter proteins. conclusion: this study showed that s. gordonii demonstrates species specific responses during interactions with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis. extensive changes were seen in energy metabolism and byproduct production implicating nutrient transfer as an important community interaction.

TI  == isothermal microcalorimetry provides new insights into biofilm variability and dynamics.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate a three-species in vitro biofilm with peri-implantitis-related bacteria for its variability and metabolic activity. streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were suspended in simulated body fluid containing 0.2% glucose to form biofilms on polished, protein-coated implant-grade titanium disks over 72 h using a flow chamber system. thereafter, biofilm-coated disks were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization/confocal laser scanning microscopy. to assess metabolic activity within the biofilms, their heat flow was recorded for 480 h at 37 degrees c by imc. the microscopic methods revealed that the total number of bacteria in the biofilms varied slightly among specimens (2.59 x 10(4) +/- 0.67 x 10(4) cells mm(-2) ), whereas all three species were found constantly with unchanged proportions (s. sanguinis  41.3 +/- 4.8%, f. nucleatum 17.7 +/- 2.1%, and p. gingivalis 41.0 +/- 4.9%). imc  revealed minor differences in time-to-peak heat flow (20.6 +/- 4.5 h), a trend consistent with the small variation in bacterial species proportions as shown by  microscopy. peak heat flow (35.8 +/- 42.6 muw), mean heat flow (13.1 +/- 22.0 muw), and total heat over 480 h (23.5 +/- 37.2 j) showed very high variation. these imc results may be attributed to differences in the initial cell counts and relative proportions of the three species, their distribution and embedment in exopolysaccharide matrix on the test specimens. the present results provide new insights into variability and dynamics of biofilms on titanium disks, aspects that should be explored in future studies of dental surfaces.

AB  == background: the aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial  dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. the quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion  method. results: using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall  showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. conclusion: it was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.

TI  == micronutrient modulation of nf-kappab in oral keratinocytes exposed to periodontal bacteria.
AB  == chronic periodontal diseases are characterised by a dysregulated and exaggerated  inflammatory/immune response to plaque bacteria. we have demonstrated previously  that oral keratinocytes up-regulate key molecular markers of inflammation, including nf-kappab and cytokine signalling, when exposed to the periodontal bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in vitro. the purpose of the current study was to investigate whether alpha-lipoic acid was able to abrogate bacterially-induced pro-inflammatory changes in the h400 oral epithelial cell line. initial studies indicated that alpha-lipoic acid supplementation (1-4 mm) significantly reduced cell attachment; lower concentrations (<0.5 mm) enabled >85% cell adhesion at 24 h. while a pro-inflammatory response, demonstrable by nf-kappab translocation, gene expression and protein production was evident in h400 cells following exposure to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, pre-incubation of cells with 0.5 mm alpha-lipoic  acid modulated this response. alpha-lipoic acid pre-treatment significantly decreased levels of bacterially-induced nf-kappab activation and il-8 protein production, and differentially modulated transcript levels for il-8, il-1beta, tnf-alpha and gm-csf, tlr2, 4, 9, s100a8, s100a9, lysyl oxidase, nf-kappab1, hmox, and sod2. overall, the data indicate that alpha-lipoic acid exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on oral epithelial cells exposed to periodontal bacteria and thus may provide a novel adjunctive treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility profiles of oral pathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is a bacterial disease that can be treated with systemic antibiotics. the aim of this study was to establish the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of five periodontal pathogens to six commonly used antibiotics in periodontics. a total of 247 periodontal bacterial isolates were tested for susceptibility to the six antibiotics using the etest method. mic(50) and mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) were calculated. both european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) and clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) breakpoints were used in the study to interpret results. beta-lactamase production was tested when amoxicillin resistance was found. mic(90) values of the anaerobic bacteria were all well below breakpoint values, except for three isolates of prevotella intermedia and one isolate of fusobacterium nucleatum that were resistant to amoxicillin (clsi breakpoints); these isolates were beta-lactamase-positive. two isolates of the capnophilic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans appeared to be amoxicillin-resistant but failed to show beta-lactamase activity. comparison with a previous study from the netherlands showed minor differences in susceptibility profiles, but the mic(90) values of a. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin and tetracycline were higher. geographical differences in the susceptibility profiles of porphyromonas gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans between european countries  were noted. comparison of european susceptibility profiles with that of a south american country (colombia) revealed a much higher resistance in the latter. owing to these differences in susceptibility profiles, it is of concern to regularly perform surveillance studies on antibiotic resistance.

AB  == aim: to determine the relationship between periodontal pathogen load and anti-human heat shock protein 60 (hhsp60) antibodies in patients with established cardiovascular disease (cvd). materials and methods: participants were cardiovascular patients (n = 74) with a previous hospital admission for myocardial infarction. concurrent periodontal pathogen load of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was determined using quantitative real-time pcr. serum antibodies to these pathogens, groel and hhsp60 were determined using an elisa. results: there was a trend for increasing anti-hhsp60 antibody as the number of bacterial species increased. the strongest positive correlations were found between anti-hhsp60 levels and numbers of t. forsythia (r = 0.43; p < 0.001) and  between anti-hhsp60 and anti-groel levels (r = 0.39; p = 0.001). patients with extensive periodontal pocketing (>/=4 mm) had higher numbers of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (p < 0.05) and a higher subgingival pathogen load (p < 0.05) than patients with minimal pocketing (</=1 site >/= 4 mm). they also had significantly elevated anti-hhsp60 levels (p < 0.05). overall, the highest anti-hhsp60 levels were seen in patients with extensive periodontal pocketing and all four bacterial species. conclusions: in cardiovascular patients, a greater burden of subgingival infection with increased levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia is associated with modestly higher anti-hhsp60 levels.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis mediates inflammasome repression in polymicrobial cultures through a novel mechanism involving reduced endocytosis.
AB  == the interleukin (il)-1beta-processing inflammasome has recently been identified as a target for pathogenic evasion of the inflammatory response by a number of bacteria and viruses. we postulated that the periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas  gingivalis may suppress the inflammasome as a mechanism for its low immunogenicity and pathogenic synergy with other, more highly immunogenic periodontal bacteria. our results show that p. gingivalis lacks signaling capability for the activation of the inflammasome in mouse macrophages. furthermore, p. gingivalis can suppress inflammasome activation by another periodontal bacterium, fusobacterium nucleatum. this repression affects il-1beta  processing, as well as other inflammasome-mediated processes, including il-18 processing and cell death, in both human and mouse macrophages. f. nucleatum activates il-1beta processing through the nlrp3 inflammasome; however, p. gingivalis repression is not mediated through reduced levels of inflammasome components. p. gingivalis can repress nlrp3 inflammasome activation by escherichia coli, and by danger-associated molecular patterns and pattern-associated molecular patterns that mediate activation through endocytosis. however, p. gingivalis does not suppress nlrp3 inflammasome activation by atp or nigericin. this suggests that p. gingivalis may preferentially suppress endocytic pathways toward inflammasome activation. to directly test whether p. gingivalis infection affects endocytosis, we assessed the uptake of fluorescent particles in the presence or absence of p. gingivalis.  our results show that p. gingivalis limits both the number of cells taking up beads and the number of beads taken up for bead-positive cells. these results provide a novel mechanism of pathogen-mediated inflammasome inhibition through the suppression of endocytosis.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

AB  == aims: to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of egg yolk immunoglobulin (igy) against periodontal disease-causing fusobacterium nucleatum. methods and results: four white leghorn hens (120 days old) were immunized with whole fus. nucleatum cells killed with 1% formaldehyde using three injections provided at 2-week intervals. igy was produced from egg yolks obtained from these immunized hens using water dilution, two-step salt precipitation and ultrafiltration. this igy was shown to have a purity of 86.8% based on its optical intensity in the stained sds-page bands. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated a high specificity for the igy against fus. nucleatum with a maximum antibody titre of 80 000. the igy had only weak cross-reactivity with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and solobacterium moorei. growth  and biofilm formation by fus. nucleatum were inhibited by igy at concentrations of 10 and 20 mg ml(-1) . immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscope assays  revealed a high binding ability of specific igy, which may explain the in vitro effectiveness of igy. in an in vivo study, igy treatment resulted in a marked decrease in alveolar bone loss after fus. nucleatum infection in a mouse model confirming the effectiveness of igy against periodontal disease-causing fus. nucleatum. conclusions: igy effectively inhibited growth and biofilm formation by fus. nucleatum and prevented the progression of periodontal disease by decreasing alveolar bone loss. significance and impact of the study: specific igy may have potential for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == strain-specific colonization patterns and serum modulation of multi-species oral  biofilm development.
AB  == periodontitis results from an ecological shift in the composition of subgingival  biofilms. subgingival community maturation is modulated by inter-organismal interactions and the relationship of communities with the host. in an effort to better understand this process, we evaluated biofilm formation, with oral commensal species, by three strains of the subgingivally prevalent microorganism  fusobacterium nucleatum and four strains of the periodontopathogen porphyromonas  gingivalis. we also tested the effect of serum, which resembles gingival exudates, on subgingival biofilms. biofilms were allowed to develop in flow cells using salivary medium. we found that although not all strains of f. nucleatum were able to grow in mono-species biofilms, forming a community with health-associated partners actinomyces oris and veillonella parvula promoted biofilm growth of all f. nucleatum strains. strains of p. gingivalis also showed  variable ability to form mono-species biofilms. p. gingivalis w50 and w83 did not form biofilms, while atcc 33277 and 381 formed biofilm structures, but only strain atcc 33277 grew over time. unlike the enhanced growth of f. nucleatum with the two health-associated species, no strain of p. gingivalis grew in three-species communities with a. oris and v. parvula. however, addition of f. nucleatum facilitated growth of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 with health-associated partners. importantly, serum negatively affected the adhesion of f. nucleatum, while it favored biofilm growth by p. gingivalis. this work highlights strain specificity in subgingival biofilm formation. environmental factors such as serum alter the colonization patterns of oral microorganisms and could impact subgingival biofilms by selectively promoting pathogenic species.

AB  == dental plaque accumulation may result in peri-implantitis, an inflammatory process causing loss of supporting bone that may lead to dental implant failure.  the antimicrobial activities of six metal and metal oxide nanoparticles and two of their composites against bacterial pathogens associated with peri-implantitis  were examined under anaerobic conditions. the activities of nanoparticles of silver (ag), cuprous oxide (cu(2)o), cupric oxide (cuo), zinc oxide (zno), titanium dioxide (tio(2)), tungsten oxide (wo(3)), ag+cuo composite and ag+zno composite were assessed by minimum inhibitory (bacteriostatic) concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) determination against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. time-kill assays were carried out to examine the dynamics of the antimicrobial activity with zno nanoparticles. mic and mbc values were in the range of <100 mug/ml to 2500 mug/ml and <100 mug/ml to >2500 mug/ml, respectively. the activity of the nanoparticles tested in descending order was ag>ag+cuo>cu(2)o>cuo>ag+zno>zno>tio(2)>wo(3). time-kill assays with zno demonstrated a significant decrease in growth of all species tested within 4h, reaching 100% within 2h for p. gingivalis and within 3h for f.  nucleatum and p. intermedia. coating titanium surfaces of dental and orthopaedic  implants with antimicrobial nanoparticles should lead to an increased rate of implant success.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == probiotic effects of orally administered lactobacillus reuteri-containing tablets on the subgingival and salivary microbiota in patients with gingivitis. a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of an orally administered probiotic on the  oral microbiota. methods: a placebo-controlled, parallel study was conducted in 40 gingivitis subjects during 8 weeks. treatment consisted on the administration  of a daily tablet, either containing lactobacillus reuteri or placebo. unstimulated saliva and subgingival samples were collected and analysed by culture and pcr. clinical and microbiological outcome variables were compared between and within groups. results: there were no significant changes between and within the groups in the clinical variables. in saliva, total anaerobic counts after 4 weeks (p = 0.021) and counts of prevotella intermedia after 8 weeks (p =  0.030), showed reductions in the test group. in subgingival samples, significant  reductions in the changes baseline to 4 weeks were observed for p. gingivalis counts (p = 0.008). with pcr, l. reuteri atcc-pta-5289 was more frequently detected than l. reuteri dsm-17938. conclusions: the effect of l. reuteri administered in tablets resulted in a reduction in the number of selected periodontal pathogens in the subgingival microbiota, without an associated clinical impact.

TI  == effect of s-prg eluate on biofilm formation and enzyme activity of oral bacteria.
AB  == recently, the antibacterial activity of a composite resin containing prereacted glass ionomer (s-prg) filler was revealed. we examined the effect of an s-prg eluate on various biologic activities of streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis. adherence ability of s. mutans was evaluated by microtiter plate assay; protease and gelatinase activities of p. gingivalis were examined by synthetic substrate hydrolysis and gelatin film spot assay, respectively. coaggregation of p. gingivalis with fusobacterium nucleatum was also examined. s-prg eluate was found to suppress streptococcal adherence. s-prg eluate inhibited the protease and gelatinase activities of p. gingivalis and the coaggregation between p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. these results indicate that s-prg eluate suppresses streptococcal adherence and inhibits the protease and coaggregation activities of p. gingivalis. these findings may prompt research into novel strategies for preventing caries and periodontitis.

TI  == co-localized or randomly distributed? pair cross correlation of in vivo grown subgingival biofilm bacteria quantified by digital image analysis.
AB  == the polymicrobial nature of periodontal diseases is reflected by the diversity of phylotypes detected in subgingival plaque and the finding that consortia of suspected pathogens rather than single species are associated with disease development. a number of these microorganisms have been demonstrated in vitro to  interact and enhance biofilm integration, survival or even pathogenic features. to examine the in vivo relevance of these proposed interactions, we extended the  spatial arrangement analysis tool of the software daime (digital image analysis in microbial ecology). this modification enabled the quantitative analysis of microbial co-localization in images of subgingival biofilm species, where the biomass was confined to fractions of the whole-image area, a situation common for medical samples. selected representatives of the disease-associated red and orange complexes that were previously suggested to interact with each other in vitro (tannerella forsythia with fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis with prevotella intermedia) were chosen for analysis and labeled with  specific fluorescent probes via fluorescence in situ hybridization. pair cross-correlation analysis of in vivo grown biofilms revealed tight clustering of f. nucleatum/periodonticum and t. forsythia at short distances (up to 6 microm) with a pronounced peak at 1.5 microm. while these results confirmed previous in vitro observations for f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, random spatial distribution was detected between p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in the in vivo samples. in conclusion, we successfully employed spatial arrangement analysis on the single cell level in clinically relevant medical samples and demonstrated the utility of this approach for the in vivo validation of in vitro observations by analyzing statistically relevant numbers of different patients. more importantly, the culture-independent nature of this approach enables similar quantitative analyses for "as-yet-uncultured" phylotypes which cannot be characterized in vitro.

TI  == autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of gram-negative anaerobes. autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a universal quorum sensing (qs) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. as fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that ai-2 of f. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified f. nucleatum  ai-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between f. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). then we tested the effect of two qs inhibitors (qsis), (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on ai-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. f. nucleatum ai-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between f. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of  which were inhibited by the qsis. f. nucleatum ai-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the qsis. our results demonstrate that f. nucleatum ai-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.

TI  == [impact of periodontal disease on arterial pressure in diabetic mice].
AB  == diabetes-driven cardiovascular diseases represent a high challenge for developed  countries. periodontal disease is strictly linked to the aforementioned diseases, due to its gram negative-driven inflammation. thus, we investigated the effects of periodontal disease on arterial pressure during the development of diabetes in mice. to this aim, c57bl/6 female mice were colonized with pathogens of periodontal tissue (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum) for 1month, whereas another group of mice did not undergo the colonization. subsequently, all mice were fed a high-fat carbohydrate-free diet for 3months. then, arterial pressure was measured in vivo  and a tomodensitometric analysis of mandibles was realized as well. our results show increased mandibular bone-loss induced by colonization with periopathogens.  in addition, periodontal infection augmented glucose-intolerance and systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, parameters already known to be affected by a fat-diet. in conclusion, we show here that periodontal disease amplifies metabolic troubles and deregulates arterial pressure, emerging as a new axis of metabolic investigation.

TI  == the role of coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum on the host response to mixed infection.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the role of coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum on the virulence of the mixed infection in mice. materials and methods: inhibition of coaggregation was carried out using lactose. in vitro, inhibition of coaggregation was verified using a coaggregation assay. in vivo, the virulence of the mixed infection, with and without coaggregation, was examined in a model of experimental periodontitis in mice. the local host response to the mixed infection, with or without coaggregation, was examined using the subcutaneous chamber model of infection. results: lactose inhibited the coaggregation between p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum at all the tested concentrations (1-0.0625 m). surprisingly, the addition of lactose to the mixed infection increased the severity of experimental periodontitis (as measured by alveolar bone loss) compared with mixed infection with coaggregating bacteria. the addition of lactose to the mixed infection resulted in mild attenuation of tnfalpha and il-1beta levels. in addition, inhibition of coaggregation resulted in inhibition of the phagocytosis of f. nucleatum and augmentation of the phagocytosis of p. gingivalis. conclusions: the ability of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum to coaggregate may limit their ability to induce experimental periodontitis in a mixed infection model. moreover, there is a shift in the phagocytosis pattern of the bacteria with the annulment of coaggregeaiton, with a reduction in f. nucleatum phagocytosis and amplification of p. gingivalis phagocytosis. the increased virulence of the mixed infection without coaggregation may surprisingly lay in the sustention of f. nucleatum in the infected sites.

TI  == human salivary cystatin sa exhibits antimicrobial effect against aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background and objective: healthy subjects who do not have aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity may possess factors in saliva that might demonstrate antibacterial activity against the bacterium. the aim of this study was to identify and purify proteins from saliva of healthy subjects that might demonstrate antibacterial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans and test the same against the bacteria. material and methods: saliva from 10 healthy  volunteers was tested individually for its anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans activity. among the 10 subjects, eight demonstrated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans activity. saliva was collected from one healthy volunteer who demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans. after clarifying the saliva, it was subjected to an affinity chromatography column with a. actinomycetemcomitans. the proteins bound to a. actinomycetemcomitans were eluted from the column and identified using mass spectrometry (maldi-tof/tof ms). among  other proteins that bound to a. actinomycetemcomitans, which included lactoferrin, immunoglobulin a and kallikrein, cystatin sa was observed in significantly higher concentrations, and this was purified from the eluate. the purified cystatin sa was tested at different concentrations for its ability to kill a. actinomycetemcomitans in a 2 h cell killing assay. the bacteria were also treated with a proteinase inhibitor, leupeptin, to clarify whether the antimicrobial effect of cystatin sa was related to its protease inhibitory function. cystatin sa was also tested for its ability to prevent binding of a. actinomycetemcomitans to buccal epithelial cells (becs) in an a. actinomycetemcomitans-bec binding assay. results: cystatin sa (0.1 mg/ml) demonstrated a statistically significant antimicrobial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans. the effect of cystatin sa decreased with lower concentrations, with 0.01 mg/ml showing no effect. the addition of monoclonal cystatin sa antibodies to the purified sample completely negated the antimicrobial effect. treatment of a. actinomycetemcomitans with leupeptin resulted in no antimicrobial effect, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity of cystatin sa is independent of its protease inhibitory function. a. actinomycetemcomitans pretreated with cystatin sa showed reduced binding to becs, suggesting a potential role for cystatin sa in decreasing the colonization of a.  actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: the present study shows that cystatin sa demonstrates antimicrobial activity against the periodontopathogen a. actinomycetemcomitans, and future studies determining the mechanism of action are necessary. the study also shows the ability of cystatin sa to reduce significantly the binding of a. actinomycetemcomitans to becs.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

AB  == objective: to assess the pattern of early bacterial colonization at implants and  teeth in patients with a history of chronic periodontitis compared with a group of healthy subjects. furthermore, the presence of host-derived markers at teeth and implants in the two subject groups was determined. method and materials: subgingival and submucosal plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples from 37 nonsubmerged healing dental implants and the deepest tooth sites per quadrant were analyzed 2 to 5 months after implant insertion. the presence of periodontal  pathogens was assessed by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction. further,  the levels of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-8, and il-10; secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor; and the neutrophil elastase activity were determined. results: eleven patients with chronic periodontitis and 13 subjects without periodontitis were recruited for this study. bacterial species associated with periodontitis were detectable at both the teeth and implants. the presence was always higher in the chronic periodontitis group; the difference was significant  for porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans at both the implants and teeth. the levels of il-1beta were higher at teeth than at implants; in contrast, more il-10 was measured at the implants. conclusion: the present results indicate that (1) dental implants inserted in periodontally compromised patients are colonized with periodontal pathogens within the first weeks of healing; (2) inflammatory markers (il-1beta) are present in higher levels at teeth as compared with implants, whereas at implants, anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10) might play the important role; and (3) the importance of periodontal treatment prior to implant insertion to reduce bacterial load and inflammation should be emphasized.

TI  == quantification of subgingival bacterial pathogens at different stages of periodontal diseases.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative oral bacteria such as treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum are closely associated with periodontal diseases. we measured the relative population (bacterial levels) of these oral pathogens in subgingival tissues of patients at  different stages of korean chronic periodontal diseases. we divided the individuals into those with chronic gingivitis (g), moderate periodontitis (p1),  severe periodontitis (p2), and normal individuals (n) (n = 20 for each group) and subgingival tissue samples were collected. we used real-time pcr with taqman probes to evaluate the change of periodontal pathogens among different stages of  periodontitis. bacterial levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus are significantly increased in individuals with chronic gingivitis and moderate periodontitis, but unchanged in severe periodontitis patients. these results suggest that analyzing certain bacterial levels among total oral pathogens may facilitate understanding of the role of periodontal bacteria in the early stages  of periodontitis.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == butyric acid induces apoptosis in both human monocytes and lymphocytes equivalently.
AB  == short-chain fatty acids (scfas) are metabolites from anaerobic periodontopathic bacteria that induce apoptosis in immune cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. however, it remains unclear if scfas from pathogens induce apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages similarly with lymphocytes. this study investigated whether scfas-induced apoptosis is equal among the immunoregulatory cells. cell apoptosis of the employed human cells was evaluated after treatment with culture  supernatants from various periodontopathic bacteria or sodium butyrate. apoptosis and viability were determined by detection of dna fragmentation and using an mts  assay kit, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum culture filtrates strongly induced apoptosis whereas prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia culture filtrates failed to induce apoptosis in the thp-1 and u937 human monocyte and macrophage cell lines. healthy gingival fibroblasts and oral epithelial cells were resistant to all the culture filtrates. gas-liquid chromatography detected butyric acid in p. gingivalis (21.0-34.0 mm) and f. nucleatum (36.0 mm) in culture filtrates, whereas, only trace levels were seen in p. nigrescens and p. intermedia. these results suggest that butyric acid produced by periodontopathic bacteria severely damages immunoregulatory cells in a consistent manner and, likewise, could be involved in mediating periodontal chronic inflammation.

TI  == direct recognition of fusobacterium nucleatum by the nk cell natural cytotoxicity receptor nkp46 aggravates periodontal disease.
AB  == periodontitis is a common human chronic inflammatory disease that results in the  destruction of the tooth attachment apparatus and tooth loss. although infections with periopathogenic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) and fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) are essential for inducing periodontitis, the nature and magnitude of the disease is determined by the host's immune response. here, we investigate the role played by the nk killer receptor nkp46 (ncr1 in mice), in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. using an oral infection periodontitis model we demonstrate that following f. nucleatum infection no alveolar bone loss is observed in mice deficient for ncr1 expression, whereas around 20% bone loss is observed in wild type mice and in mice infected with p. gingivalis. by using subcutaneous chambers inoculated with  f. nucleatum we demonstrate that immune cells, including nk cells, rapidly accumulate in the chambers and that this leads to a fast and transient, ncr1-dependant tnf-alpha secretion. we further show that both the mouse ncr1 and  the human nkp46 bind directly to f. nucleatum and we demonstrate that this binding is sensitive to heat, to proteinase k and to pronase treatments. finally, we show in vitro that the interaction of nk cells with f. nucleatum leads to an ncr1-dependent secretion of tnf-alpha. thus, the present study provides the first evidence that ncr1 and nkp46 directly recognize a periodontal pathogen and that this interaction influences the outcome of f. nucleatum-mediated periodontitis.

TI  == specificity of antimicrobial peptide ll-37 to neutralize periodontopathogenic lipopolysaccharide activity in human oral fibroblasts.
AB  == background: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 is known to have a potent lipopolysaccharide (lps)-neutralizing activity in various cell types. because of  observed heterogeneity within periodontopathogenic lps, the authors hypothesized  that ll-37 had specificity to neutralize such lps activity. the present study, therefore, aims to investigate the lps-neutralizing activity of ll-37 to various  periodontopathogenic lps in interleukin-8 (il-8) production after challenging them in human oral fibroblasts. methods: human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (pdlf) and gingival fibroblasts (gf) were cultured from biopsies of periodontal ligament and gingival tissues. after cell confluence in 24-well plates, lps (10 mug/ml) from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were added with or without ll-37 (10 mug/ml). after 18 hours, the supernatant was collected and analyzed in  il-8 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all periodontopathogenic lps statistically significantly induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf (p <0.01). after neutralization with ll-37, both pdlf and gf showed a statistically significant reduction in il-8 production compared with lps-treated groups without ll-37 (p <0.01), and the percentage of reduction in il-8 production in pdlf appeared to be higher than in gf. in addition, the percentage of reduction in il-8 production varied considerably according to each  periodontopathogenic lps. conclusions: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 had an ability to suppress periodontopathogenic lps-induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf. its lps-neutralizing activity revealed specificity to periodontopathogenic lps and seemed to be dependent on the heterogeneity within lps between different genera.

AB  == objective: we aimed at quantifying the presence of periodontopathogens in gingival biopsies from periodontitis patients treated with different photoablative lasers (diode gaas, er:yag, nd:yag, and co(2) lasers) and histologically analyzing their effects on the gingiva. background data: substantial evidence indicates that intracellular location of periodontal bacteria in the gingival epithelium may contribute to chronic periodontitis. methods: sixteen adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were subjected to conventional scaling/root planing and topical chlorhexidine, and immediately laser-irradiated on the inner and outer free gingiva. small gingival biopsies were subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction and cytofluorescence to identify periodontopathogens; tissue damage and endothelial icam-1 expression were assessed by histological and immunofluorescence analyses. results: high dna  levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and ekenella corrodens, were detected in all samples. nd:yag and diode lasers were capable of  eradicating periodontopathogenic bacteria endowed within gingival epithelial cells outside periodontal pockets, without causing connective tissue damage and microvessel rupture. they also reduced icam-1 immunolabelling by the vascular endothelium. conversely, er:yag lasers induced marked microvessel rupture and bleeding and failed to completely and selectively ablate the infected gingival epithelium, whereas co(2) laser caused heat-induced coagulation of the lamina propria. conclusions: this study indicates that periodontopathogens can persist within cells outside the pocket epithelium, despite conventional periodontal treatment. nd:yag and diode lasers are able to eradicate intra- and extracellular bacteria from these sites, suggesting that they can be considered suitable devices to improve the clinical outcome of periodontal disease.

TI  == regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with or without systemic doxycycline. a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == aim: comparison of regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with and without administration of postsurgical systemic doxycycline (doxy). methods: in each of 61 patients one infrabony defect was treated with enamel matrix derivative (emd), emd plus filler or membrane at two centres. by random assignment patients received either 200 mg doxy per day or placebo (plac) for 7 days after surgery. prior to and 6 months after surgery probing pocket depths (ppd) and vertical attachment level (pal-v) were obtained. results: fifty-four patients (doxy: 27; plac: 27) were re-examined after 6 months and had been treated exclusively with emd. seven to 8 days after surgery 81% of defects in both groups showed complete  flap closure. in both groups significant (p < 0.001) ppd reduction (doxy: 3.87 +/- 1.44 mm; plac: 3.67 +/- 1.30 mm) and pal-v gain (doxy: 3.11 +/- 1.50 mm; plac: 3.32 +/- 1.83 mm) were observed. however, the differences failed to be statistically significant (ppd: 0.20; p = 0.588; pal-v: 0.21; p = 0.657). conclusions: two hundred milligram systemic doxy administered for 7 days after therapy of infrabony defects with emd failed to result in better ppd reduction and pal-v gain compared with plac which may be due to low power (50%) and, thus,  random chance.

TI  == connective tissue graft plus resin-modified glass ionomer restoration for the treatment of gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesions: microbiological and immunological results.
AB  == objectives: it was previously reported the clinical results of placing subgingival resin-modified glass ionomer restoration for treatment of gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesions. the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of this treatment on the subgingival biofilm and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) inflammatory markers. materials and methods: thirty-four patients presenting the combined defect were selected. the defects were treated with either connective tissue graft plus modified glass ionomer restoration (ctg+r) or with connective tissue graft only (ctg). evaluation included bleeding on probing and probing depth, 5 different bacteria targets in the subgingival plaque assessed at baseline, 45, and 180 days post treatments, and 9 inflammatory mediators were also assessed in the gcf. results: the levels of each target bacterium were similar during the entire period of evaluation (p > 0.05), both within and between groups. the highest levels among the studied species were observed for the bacterium associated with periodontal health. additionally, the levels of all cyto/chemokines analyzed were not statistically different between groups (p > 0.05). conclusion: within the limits of the present study, it can be concluded that the presence of subgingival restoration may not interfere with the subgingival microflora and with gcf inflammatory markers analyzed. clinical relevance: this approach usually leads to the placement of a subgingival restoration. there is a lack of information about the microbiological and immunological effects of this procedure. the results suggest that this combined approach may be considered as a treatment option for the lesion included in this study.

TI  == effects of oil drops containing lactobacillus salivarius wb21 on periodontal health and oral microbiota producing volatile sulfur compounds.
AB  == the objective of this paper is to evaluate the effects of oil drops containing lactobacillus salivarius wb21 on periodontal health and oral microbiota producing volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). for this study, 42 subjects were randomly assigned to receive oil samples containing l. salivarius wb21 or a placebo for two weeks. oral assessment and saliva collection were performed on days 1 and 15. bacterial analysis was performed using the real-time polymerase chain reaction and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp). in both the experimental and placebo groups, the average probing depth, number of periodontal pockets, and the percentage of bleeding on probing (bop) decreased while stimulated salivary flow increased on day 15. bop was reduced in the experimental group compared with the placebo group (p = 0.010). in the experimental group, total bacterial numbers decreased, and the number of l. salivarius increased. the number of prevotella intermedia, which is correlated with hydrogen sulfide concentration in mouth air, increased in the placebo group and did not change in  the experimental group. t-rflp analysis found that the peak area proportions representing porphyromonas gingivalis, p. intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and fusobacterium nucleatum decreased in the experimental group, although there was no significant change in the bacterial composition. thus we observed oil drops containing l. salivarius wb21 improved bop and inhibited the reproduction of total and vsc-producing periodontopathic bacteria compared with the placebo group, but also showed the limit of its efficacy in controlling vscs producing and periodontal pathogens.

TI  == [effect of periodontal surgery on the subgingival periodontal microbiota in artificial class iii furcation defects: an experimental study in monkeys].
AB  == objective: this study was to longitudinally evaluate the change of prevalence of  five periodontal putative pathogens in the subgingival plaque of artificial class iii furcation defects at the three time-points, including before the establishment of furcation defects, before and 6 months after periodontal surgery. methods: eighteen chronic infected class iii fi defects were created at  the mandibular first molars, second molars and second premolars of three adult male macaca fascicularis. the samples of subgingival plaque were obtained from the subgingival area of furcation defects in buccal and lingual sites before the  establishment of furcation defects, before and 6 months after periodontal surgery. 36 samples were obtained at one time-points. five periodontal putative pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema dinticola (td), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), were detected with 16srrna based pcr. results: 1. the prevalence of pg, tf, td and fn was gradually increased, from 58.3% to 69.4%  to 88.9%, 47,2% to 69.4% to 83.3%, 13.9% to 36.1% to 61.1% (p<0.01), and 69.4% to 91.7% to 91.7% (p<0.05), respectively during the experimental period. the prevalence of fn was higher than pg, tf and td. the prevalence of aa was the lowest and no obvious difference among the three samplings(from 25.9% to 13.9% to 33.3%)was detected. 2. the prevalence of more than 3 species simultaneously detected was increased from 38.9% to 61.1% to 83.3% (p <0.01). the red complex (pg + tf + td) was detected from 8.3% to 27.8% to 44.4% (p<0.01) at the different time point. 3. the combined detection frequency of red complex in the inflammatory sites (87.5%), which were histologically defined as inflammatory cells infiltrated in furcation area 6 months post-surgery, and the same sites pre-surgery (62.5%) was more than that in pre-creation of furcation defects (p<0.01). but there were no significant differences compared to that in non inflammatory area (60.0%, 40.0%), respectively. conclusion: the prevalence of periodontal pathogenic bacteria correlated with the severity of local inflammation. the increase of coexistent rate of red complex at the second and third sampling times suggests that the red complex play important role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. fn may be a resident bacteria in the subgingival plaque, play a bridge role on the biofilm formation and maturation. aa may not be a major causative bacteria in the clinical periodontitis.

TI  == the relationship between turbidity of mouth-rinsed water and oral health status.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between turbidity of mouth rinsed water and oral health status such as dental and periodontal conditions, oral hygiene status, flow rate of saliva and oral bacteria. materials and methods: subjects were 165 patients who visited the dental hospital, tokyo medical and dental university. oral health status, including dental and periodontal conditions, oral hygiene status and flow rate of saliva, was clinically examined. the turbidity was measured with a turbidimeter.  quantification of fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and total bacteria levels was performed using real-time pcr. the pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis were used to explore the associations between the turbidity and oral health parameters. results: the turbidity showed significant correlations with the number of decayed teeth and deep pockets, the plaque index, extent of tongue coating and fusobacterium spp, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, t. denticola and total bacteria levels. in a multiple regression model, the turbidity was negatively associated with the flow rate of saliva and positively associated with the total number of bacteria (p < 0.001). conclusion: current findings suggested that turbidity of mouth rinsed water could be used as an indicator to evaluate oral health condition and the amount of bacteria in the oral cavity. in addition, the turbiditimeter appeared as a simple and objective device for screening abnormality of oral health condition at chair side as well as community-based research.

TI  == association between oral malodour and periodontal disease-related parameters in the general population.
AB  == aim: to determine the association between halitosis detection and periodontal status in systemically healthy non-smokers and to assess whether halitosis was related to quantities of fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis on  the tongue dorsum. methods: periodontal examinations, tongue coating determination, halimeter(r) readings and organoleptic assessments of mouth odour  were performed in 28 chronic periodontitis patients, 23 chronic gingivitis patients and 27 healthy individuals. the quantities of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were determined in tongue specimens by real-time pcr. results: halitosis was more likely to be detected in patients with periodontitis (or = 9.2) and gingivitis (or = 4.6) than in healthy subjects. the posterior tongue odour was similar for all groups; had the highest score of all organoleptic assessments and was significantly correlated with halimeter(r) scores and the odour of the whole mouth air. periodontitis patients harboured significantly greater amounts of p. gingivalis on their tongue, yet similar quantities of f. nucleatum compared to gingivitis patients and healthy subjects. the amount of p.  gingivalis residing on the tongue dorsum of periodontitis patients was significantly associated with halitosis recordings, while the amount of f. nucleatum was related to tongue coating in healthy controls, which corroborates its role in biofilm formation. conclusions: patients with periodontal disease were at higher risk for halitosis detection than healthy individuals. the posterior portion of the tongue dorsum seems to be an important source of odourous compounds, regardless of periodontal condition. p. gingivalis residing on the tongue of periodontitis patients may play a key role in oral malodour production.

TI  == effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. we report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding rnas is stimulated. in the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. however, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. we also observed a significant upregulation of abc transport systems and putative transposases. changes in clusters of orthologous groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of  pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of  transcription factors were upregulated. finally, we identified several small noncoding rnas whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. these results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.

TI  == azithromycin as an adjunctive treatment of generalized severe chronic periodontitis: clinical, microbiologic, and biochemical parameters.
AB  == background: this study examines the efficacy of azithromycin in combination with  non-surgical periodontal therapy on clinical and microbiologic parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) matrix metalloproteinases-8 (mmp-8) levels over 6 months in patients with severe generalized chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: twenty-eight of 36 patients with severe generalized cp were included in this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study. they were randomly assigned to azithromycin or placebo groups (500 mg, once daily for 3 days). probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level, dichotomous presence or absence of supragingival plaque accumulation, and bleeding on probing were recorded. gcf samples were obtained from one single-rooted tooth with pd >/= 6 mm, whereas microbiologic samples were collected from two single-rooted teeth with pd >/= 6 mm. microbiologic parameters were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and total bacteria. gcf mmp-8 levels were determined by immunofluorescence assay. results: azithromycin and placebo groups demonstrated similar but significant improvements in all clinical parameters (p <0.05). a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia, and total bacteria significantly decreased over the 6-month period in both groups, whereas  f. nucleatum was significantly reduced in all visits in the azithromycin group, with the levels also being lower compared with those of the placebo group (p <0.05). the azithromycin and placebo groups exhibited significant reduction in gcf mmp-8 levels at the post-treatment visit and at 2 weeks (p <0.05). conclusion: on the basis of the present findings, it can be concluded that adjunctive azithromycin provides no additional benefit over non-surgical periodontal treatment on parameters investigated in patients with severe generalized cp.

TI  == treponema denticola chymotrypsin-like proteinase (ctlp) integrates spirochaetes within oral microbial communities.
AB  == treponema denticola is found ubiquitously in the human oral cavity and is mainly  associated with bacterial communities implicated in the establishment and development of periodontal disease. the ability to become integrated within biofilm communities is crucial to the growth and survival of oral bacteria, and involves inter-bacterial coaggregation, metabolic cooperation, and synergy against host defences. in this article we show that the chymotrypsin-like proteinase (ctlp), found within a high-molecular-mass complex on the cell surface, mediates adherence of t. denticola to other potential periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and parvimonas micra. proteolytic activity per se did not appear to be required for the interactions, and expression of the major outer-sheath protein (msp) was not necessary, except for binding parv. micra. biofilms of densely packed cells and matrix, up to 40 microm in depth, were formed between t. denticola and p. gingivalis on salivary pellicle, with t. denticola cells enriched in the upper layers. expression of ctlp, but not msp, was critical for dual-species biofilm formation with p. gingivalis. t. denticola did not form dual-species biofilms with any of the other three periodontal bacterial species under various conditions. synergy between t. denticola and p. gingivalis was also shown by increased inhibition of blood clotting, which was ctlp-dependent. the results demonstrate the critical role of ctlp in interactions of t. denticola with other oral micro-organisms, leading to synergy in microbial community development and host tissue pathogenesis.

TI  == oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == clustering behavior in microbial communities from acute endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: acute endodontic infections harbor heterogeneous microbial communities in both the root canal (rc) system and apical tissues. data comparing the microbial structure and diversity in endodontic infections in related ecosystems, such as rc with necrotic pulp and acute apical abscess (aaa), are scarce in the literature. the aim of this study was to examine the presence of selected endodontic pathogens in paired samples from necrotic rc and aaa using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) followed by the construction of cluster profiles. methods: paired samples of rc and aaa exudates were collected from 20 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of selected strict and facultative anaerobic strains. the frequency of species was compared between the rc and the aaa samples. a stringent neighboring clustering algorithm was applied to investigate  the existence of similar high-order groups of samples. a dendrogram was constructed to show the arrangement of the sample groups produced by the hierarchical clustering. results: all samples harbored bacterial dna. porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella nigrescens, filifactor alocis, and tannerela forsythia were frequently detected in both rc and aaa samples. the selected anaerobic species were distributed in diverse small bacteria consortia.  the samples of rc and aaa that presented at least one of the targeted microorganisms were grouped in small clusters. conclusions: anaerobic species were frequently detected in acute endodontic infections and heterogeneous microbial communities with low clustering behavior were observed in paired samples of rc and aaa.

AB  == objectives: we aimed to achieve detailed biomaterials characterization of a drug  delivery system for local periodontitis treatment based on electrospun metronidazole-loaded resorbable polylactide (pla) fibers. methods: pla fibers loaded with 0.1-40% (w/w) mna were electrospun and were characterized by sem and  dsc. hplc techniques were used to analyze the release profiles of metronidazole (mna) from these fibers. the antibacterial efficacy was determined by measuring inhibition zones of drug-containing aliquots from the same electrospun fiber mats in an agar diffusion test. three pathogenic periodontal bacterial strains: fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas  gingivalis were studied. cytotoxicity testing was performed with human gingival fibroblasts by: (i) counting viable cells via live/dead staining methods and (ii) by exposing cells directly onto the surface of mna-loaded fibers. results: mna concentration influenced fiber diameters and thus w/w surface areas: diameter being minimal and area maximal at 20% mna. hplc showed that these 20% mna fibers  had the fastest initial mna release. from the third day, mna release was slower and nearly linear with time. all fiber mats released 32-48% of their total drug content within the first 7 days. aliquots of media taken from the fiber mats inhibited the growth of all three bacterial strains. mna released up to the 28th  day from fiber mats containing 40% mna significantly decreased the viability of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis and up to the 2nd day also for the resistant a. actinomycetemcomitans. all of the investigated fibers and aliquots showed excellent cytocompatibility. significance: this study shows that mna-loaded electrospun fiber mats represent an interesting class of resorbable drug delivery systems. sustained drug release properties and cytocompatibility suggest their potential clinical applicability for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == investigation and quantification of key periodontal pathogens in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background and objective: diabetes is a recognized risk factor for periodontitis. there are conflicting data regarding whether healthy diabetic patients or diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis have an altered subgingival microbiota compared with nondiabetic individuals. the aim of the present study was to detect quantitative differences in selected periodontopathogens in the subgingival plaque of diabetic patients using taqman quantitative pcr. material and methods: type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with (n=9) or without chronic periodontal disease (n=15) were recruited and matched to nondiabetic control subjects (n=12 periodontally healthy, n=12 chronic periodontitis). subgingival plaque samples were collected from deep (>4 mm probing depth) and shallow sites (</=3 mm probing depth) using paper points, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis were  quantified. results: forty-eight subjects (69 samples) were recruited. marked differences were seen in the levels of all three bacterial species, relative to the total bacterial population, according to periodontal health status. using real-time quantitative pcr, bacterial counts for p. gingivalis were significantly higher in deep pockets of diabetic and nondiabetic subjects compared with periodontally healthy subjects (p<0.05) but did not differ significantly between  diabetics and nondiabetics. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in all groups in low quantities, and counts did not differ significantly between groups (p>0.05). f. nucleatum was abundant in all groups, with no clear significant differences between groups. p. gingivalis was found in higher quantities in periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p<0.05). statistically significant positive correlations were identified between pocket depth and counts for all three species tested (p<0.05). conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis were present in significantly different quantities and proportions in subgingival plaque, according to periodontal disease status. no significant differences were identified between the subgingival microbiota of  type 2 diabetes mellitus patients compared with nondiabetic subjects.

AB  == the galls of quercus infectoria are commonly used in malay traditional medicine to treat wound infections after childbirth. in india, they are employed traditionally as dental applications such as that in treatment of toothache and gingivitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of galls of quercus infectoria olivier against oral bacteria which are known to cause dental caries and periodontitis. methanol and acetone extracts were screened against two gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419) and two gram-negative bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586). the screening test of antibacterial activity was performed using agar-well diffusion  method. subsequently, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by using twofold serial microdilution method at a concentration ranging between 0.01 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml. minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was obtained by subculturing microtiter wells which showed no changes in colour of the indicator  after incubation. both extracts showed inhibition zones which did not differ significantly (p < 0.05) against each tested bacteria. among all tested bacteria, s. salivarius was the most susceptible. the mic ranges for methanol and acetone extracts were the same, between 0.16 and 0.63 mg/ml. the mbc value, for methanol  and acetone extracts, was in the ranges 0.31-1.25 mg/ml and 0.31-2.50 mg/ml, respectively. both extracts of q. infectoria galls exhibited similar antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. thus, the galls may be considered  as effective phytotherapeutic agents for the prevention of oral pathogens.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

AB  == background and objective: the dog has been used extensively for experimental and  microbiological studies on periodontitis and peri-implantitis without detailed knowledge about the predominant flora of the subgingival plaque. this study was designed to evaluate the predominant cultivable bacterial species in dogs and compare them phenotypically and genotypically with corresponding human species. material and methods: four subgingival samples were taken from two upper premolars in each of six labrador retrievers. the samples from each dog were processed for anaerobic culture. from the samples of each dog, the five or six predominating bacteria based on colony morphology were selected and pure cultured. each of the strains was characterized by gram stain, anaerobic/aerobic  growth and api-zym test. eighteen strains showing clear-cut phenotypic differences were further classified based on dna sequencing technology. cross-reactions of dna probes from human and dog strains were also tested against a panel of both human and dog bacterial species. results: thirty-one strains in the dogs were isolated and characterized. they represented 21 different species,  of which six belonged to the genus porphyromonas. no species was found consistently in the predominant flora of all six dogs. porphyromonas crevioricanis and fusobacterium canifelinum were the two most prevalent species in predominant flora in dogs. dna probes from human and dog species cross-reacted to some extent with related strains from humans and dogs; however, distinct exceptions were found. conclusion: the predominant cultural subgingival flora in  dogs shows great similarities with the subgingival bacteria from humans at the genus level, but distinct differences at the species level; however, a genetic relatedness could be disclosed for most strains investigated.

TI  == quantitative analysis of microbiota in saliva, supragingival, and subgingival plaque of chinese adults with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the profiles of periodontopathogenic bacteria in a chinese population using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr). materials and methods: twenty-four periodontally healthy chinese subjects and 60 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. qrt-pcr was used to quantify aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia as well as total bacterial counts from 252  samples collected from the saliva, supragingival plaque, and subgingival plaque of all 84 subjects. results: the detection frequency of a. actinomycetemcomitans  was less than 50%. f. nucleatum was detected in all subjects and cp patients had  higher bacterial loads than healthy subjects. the median proportion of f. nucleatum was significantly higher in subgingival plaque than in supragingival plaque and saliva. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia had higher detection frequencies and bacterial loads in cp patients than in healthy subjects. the median proportion of p. gingivalis was significantly different among the three intraoral locations in the cp group and its proportion in subgingival plaque was  9.01%. moreover, strong positive spearman's correlations were found in a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia counts across the three intraoral locations. conclusion: the presence and bacteria loads of these four bacteria in this chinese population are similar to those from other populations.  clinical relevance: examination of bacterial detection frequency and loads in chinese adults may assist microbial studies of periodontal disease and will shed  light on periodontal disease diagnosis and treatment using antibiotics in the chinese population.

TI  == oral bacterial dna differ in their ability to induce inflammatory responses in human monocytic cell lines.
AB  == background: deoxyribonucleic acids (dna) of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas  gingivalis (pg) and tannerella forsythia, stimulate cytokine production in human  monocytic cells (thp-1) through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and nuclear factor-kappab signaling. fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in periodontally diseased tissues and is reported to synergize with pg, enhancing the pathogenicity. we investigate inflammatory mediator production in thp-1 cells challenged with fn and streptococcus sanguinis (ss) dna, a non-pathogenic oral bacteria, and further assess whether cytokines triggered by whole pathogens or pg lipopolysaccharide (lps) are affected by tlr-9 signaling inhibitors (chloroquine). methods: thp-1 cells were stimulated with pg-dna (100 ng/mul), fn-dna (100 ng/mul), ss-dna (100 ng/mul), pg-lps (10 ng/mul), and heat-killed whole bacteria (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 16 hours with or without chloroquine pretreatment (10 mug/ml). interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. statistical analyses included analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using dunnett or tukey methods and paired t test. a value of p <0.05 was significant. results: inflammatory mediator levels were increased in response to all the stimuli with the exception of ss-dna (p <0.05). chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased cytokine production from thp-1 cells with the exception of il-6 production triggered by whole fn and ss (p <0.05). conclusions: differences exist among oral bacterial dna in inducing immune responses. by altering the conditions in cytosolic compartments, we can interfere with cellular responses triggered by extracellular receptor activation. thus, alternative treatment approaches targeted to intracellular receptors might  be of benefit in controlling periodontal inflammation.

TI  == the adhesion of oral bacteria to modified titanium surfaces: role of plasma proteins and electrostatic forces.
AB  == objectives: modifications of titanium (ti) implant surfaces have a significant effect on early biofilm formation and the outcome of implant procedures. the aim  of this study was to examine the role of plasma proteins and electrostatic forces in the adhesion mechanism of oral bacteria to modified ti surfaces. materials and methods: ti discs with three different types of surface modifications, machined,  acid-etched, and acid-etched and blasted, were examined for adhesion of oral bacteria: streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. following pretreatment of the ti with ion rich solutions or coating by human serum albumin or fibronectin, bacterial adhesion was examined by scanning electron microscopy and assessed quantitatively by dna analysis. ti coating by proteins as well as bacterial adhesion and their interrelationships were further  investigated through confocal scanning laser microscopy. results: acid-etched and blasted ti surfaces exhibited significantly higher amounts of bacteria adhesion than the other two surfaces. calcium was found to serve as a bridging agent in the adhesion process of s. mutans and f. nucleatum to ti surfaces. although albumin coating of the ti reduced the adhesion of s. mutans to all surfaces, it had no influence on the adhesion of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. coating the ti with fibronectin enhanced p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum adhesion. conclusions: bacterial adhesion to ti surfaces is roughness-dependent, and the adhesion mechanism is influenced by ions and proteins of the initial coating derived from  the blood.

TI  == extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: whilst certain bacteria have long been known to secrete extracellular deoxyribonuclease (dnase), the purpose in microbial physiology was  unclear. recently, however, this enzyme has been demonstrated to confer enhanced  virulence, enabling bacteria to evade the host's immune defence of extruded dna/chromatin filaments, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). as nets have recently been identified in infected periodontal tissue, the aim of this study was to screen periodontal bacteria for extracellular dnase activity. material and methods: to determine whether dnase activity was membrane bound or secreted, 34 periodontal bacteria were cultured in broth and on agar plates. pelleted bacteria and supernatants from broth cultures were analysed for their ability to degrade dna, with relative activity levels determined using an agarose gel electrophoresis assay. following culture on dna-supplemented agar, expression was determined by the presence of a zone of hydrolysis and dnase activity related to colony size. results: twenty-seven bacteria, including red and orange complex  members porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum,  parvimonas micra, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus and prevotella nigrescens, were observed to express extracellular dnase activity. differences in dnase activity were noted, however,  when bacteria were assayed in different culture states. analysis of the activity  of secreted dnase from bacterial broth cultures confirmed their ability to degrade nets. conclusion: the present study demonstrates, for the first time, that dnase activity is a relatively common property of bacteria associated with advanced periodontal disease. further work is required to determine the importance of this bacterial dnase activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == isoflavonoids and coumarins from glycyrrhiza uralensis: antibacterial activity against oral pathogens and conversion of isoflavans into isoflavan-quinones during purification.
AB  == phytochemical investigation of a supercritical fluid extract of glycyrrhiza uralensis has led to the isolation of 20 known isoflavonoids and coumarins, and glycycarpan (7), a new pterocarpan. the presence of two isoflavan-quinones, licoriquinone a (8) and licoriquinone b (9), in a fraction subjected to gel filtration on sephadex lh-20 is due to suspected metal-catalyzed oxidative degradation of licoricidin (1) and licorisoflavan a (2). the major compounds in the extract, as well as 8, were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of several major oral pathogens. compounds 1 and 2 showed the most potent antibacterial activities, causing a marked growth inhibition of the cariogenic species streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus at 10 mug/ml and the periodontopathogenic species porphyromonas gingivalis (at 5 mug/ml) and prevotella intermedia (at 5 mug/ml for 1 and 2.5 mug/ml for 2). only 1 moderately inhibited growth of fusobacterium nucleatum at the highest concentration tested (10 mug/ml).

TI  == antimicrobial effects of o-cymen-5-ol and zinc, alone & in combination in simple  solutions and toothpaste formulations.
AB  == objectives: this study aimed to evaluate antimicrobial effects of an o-cymen-5-ol/zinc system. methods: o-cymen-5-ol and zinc gluconate minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were  determined against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and candida albicans. synergy was investigated by checkerboard mic/mbc; inhibition of p. gingivalis protease activity and s. mutans glycolysis were investigated. slurried toothpastes containing the system were assessed in kill time assays against s. mutans and e.  coli. results: o-cymen-5-ol mic was between 1.7 mm to 3.4 mm; mbc was 3.4 mm to 6.7 mm. zinc gluconate mic was 2.8 mm to 11 mm; mbc was between 11 mm and >44 mm. the two agents in solution showed synergy (fici</=0.50) against p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, with mic of 0.42 mm/0.69 mm for o-cymen-5-ol/zinc gluconate, respectively. zinc inhibited glycolysis and protease to a greater degree than o-cymen-5-ol; glycolysis inhibition by the two agents was additive. o-cymen-5-ol/zinc chloride in toothpaste showed greater effects than placebo (120s log10 kill=7.35+/-0.40 and 4.02+/-0.40, respectively). conclusions: the zinc/o-cymen-5-ol system has direct antimicrobial effects and inhibits oral disease-related processes. synergistic effects were seen against anaerobes. a system combining o-cymen-5-ol and zinc shows properties desirable for incorporation in toothpastes.

TI  == the comparative evaluation of xanthan gel with chlorhexidine (chlosite) in smokers and non-smokers: a clinical and microbiological assessment.
AB  == background and objectives: prevention of the periodontal disease progression is the primary goal of periodontal therapy. when conventional therapy is found inadequate to attain periodontal health in chronic periodontitis, local antimicrobial agents have been used as an adjunct with scaling and root planning  (srp) which has reproduced encouraging results. hence, this study was undertaken  to evaluate the new sustained released local drug chlosite clinically and microbiologically in smokers and non-smokers. materials and methods: the patients were grouped into experimental group a treated with srp plus chlosite (srp + chl), experimental group b treated with chlosite alone (chl), and control group c treated only with srp alone. a total number of 141 sites from six patients (67 sites from three non-smoker patients and 74 sites from three smoker patients) participated in this study. the clinical parameters, plaque index (pi), gingival  index (gi), bleeding index (bi), and relative attachment level (ral), were recorded and subgingival plaque samples were collected and subjected to microbiological analysis. results: on comparison of smokers and non-smokers, in srp group, non-smokers showed a higher reduction in bi and gi and smokers showed  a higher reduction in pi. there was no significant gain in ral of both smokers and non-smokers. in srp + chl group, non-smokers showed a higher reduction in relation to bi and gi and smokers showed a higher reduction in relation to pi. there was no significant gain in ral of both smokers and non-smokers. in chl group, both smokers and non-smokers showed a nonsignificant reduction in bi, gi,  and ral, but smokers showed a significant reduction in pi as compared with non-smokers. all the groups showed reduction in the microbial count of fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia which were found to be statistically not significant when it was compared between non-smokers and smokers. interpretation and conclusion: in this study, all treatment groups were found to be efficacious in the treatment of periodontal disease as demonstrated by improvement in pi, gi, bi, and ral. combination of srp and chlosite resulted in added benefits compared with the two treatment groups.

TI  == effect of a self-etching adhesive containing an antibacterial monomer on clinical periodontal parameters and subgingival microbiologic composition in orthodontic patients.
AB  == introduction: the aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of a self-etching adhesive system containing an antibacterial monomer on periodontal health and subgingival microbiologic composition in orthodontic patients and to compare it with a conventional adhesive system. methods: a split-mouth design was chosen, and 15 patients were included in the study. brackets in contralateral quadrants were bonded with either a conventional adhesive system (control) or a self-etching adhesive system that contained an antibacterial monomer. clinical periodontal parameters including plaque index, gingival index, probing depths, and bleeding on probing were determined. subgingival plaque samples were collected before bracket placement (t0) and at the 6-month follow-up (t1). the real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction assay was used to determine the subgingival counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and campylobacter rectus. for clinical periodontal parameters, analysis of covariance (ancova) and, for bacterial counts, wilcoxon tests were used for statistical comparisons at the p <0.05 level. results: clinical periodontal parameters were not changed, and they were not different between the  groups from t0 to t1. t forsythensis and f nucleatum increased during the treatment period in both groups (p <0.05). the majority of the bacteria were t nucleatum at t0 and t1 in both groups. changes in bacterial load from t0 to t1 were not different between groups except for t forsythensis and f nucleatum (p <0.05). conclusions: the use of an antibacterial monomer did not have an additional positive effect on clinical periodontal parameters. when used in bonding orthodontic brackets, the antibacterial monomer failed to reduce periodontopathogenic bacteria when compared with the conventional adhesive system during a 6-month treatment period.

TI  == antibacterial activity of povidone-iodine against an artificial biofilm of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == objective: to investigate the antibacterial activity of povidone-iodine (pvp-i) on an artificial dual species biofilm of periodontal pathogens. design: porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum grown in broth culture was inoculated on polycarbonate membrane (pcm) tissue culture inserts. after incubation for 72 h, pvp-i solutions were applied to the biofilm for the time period ranging from 0.5 to 5 min. after addition of a deactivator, each pcm was removed and the biofilm on the pcm was serially diluted and plated on blood agar  plates and cultured anaerobically for 7 days. then viable bacteria were enumerated. results: in the dual species biofilm model, f. nucleatum showed an approximately 200-fold increase in viable counts when compared with mono-microbial biofilm. in dual species biofilm, pvp-i with concentration equal to or greater than 2% was required to significantly reduce p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. when the contact time of pvp-i was increased to 1 min or greater, no difference in antibacterial activity of pvp-i was observed in any concentration.  conclusion: these results suggest that 30s application of 2% pvp-i would be effective in suppressing both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in dual-species biofilm, and this provides clinical implication for the control of subgingival biofilm.

TI  == colonisation of the oral cavity by periodontopathic bacteria in complete denture  wearers.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria and the sites of colonisation in elderly upper and lower complete denture wearers. we also investigated the relationship between level of oral hygiene and colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: forty edentulous and 37 dentate volunteers participated in this study. samples were collected from whole saliva, and levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by pcr invader technology. detection of these species on oral mucosal and denture surfaces was performed by pcr. fisher's exact test was used for the statistical analysis. cluster analysis was employed to investigate trends in the periodontopathic bacteria flora in each sampling area. results: detection rates of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva were lower under edentulous conditions than under dentulous conditions, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01). detection rate of f. nucleatum was the highest in all areas. a positive correlation was observed between dna quantification of p. gingivalis and number of candida species in saliva. cluster analysis of the test  species identified two clusters. tongue-coating status was associated with the detection rate of all periodontopathic bacteria investigated, and denture plaque  status was associated with the detection rate of t. denticola and f. nucleatum. conclusion: results indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria under edentulous conditions and that the status of oral hygiene of the mucosal or denture surfaces affects colonisation by t. denticola and f. nucleatum.

TI  == levels of periodontal pathogens in neonatal gastric aspirates and possible maternal sites of origin.
AB  == maternal periodontal infection has been recognized as a risk factor for preterm and low birthweight infants. it is suspected that pathogens causing periodontal disease may translocate to the amniotic cavity and so contribute to triggering an adverse pregnancy outcome. this study aimed to determine levels and proportions of periodontal bacteria in neonatal gastric aspirates obtained from complicated pregnancies and the respective maternal oral and vaginal samples using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach, and also to determine the origin of the neonate's bacteria by sequence comparisons between the three sites. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythia were not observed  in the neonates or in the women's vaginas. interestingly, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified in the neonates in two samples (2.98e+02 and 1.75e+02 cells ml(-1)) and in association with fusobacterium nucleatum, which was observed at high prevalence (10%) and at high levels reaching up to 2.32e+03 cells ml(-1). although f. nucleatum was also present in the vaginal samples, the results demonstrated that the neonatal strains were more likely to originate from the mother's oral cavity than to be vaginal strains.

TI  == detection of odoriferous subgingival and tongue microbiota in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with oral malodor using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: halitosis has been correlated with the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) produced in the oral cavity by metabolic activity of bacteria colonizing the periodontal pockets and the dorsum of the tongue. it has  been assumed that there is a relationship between periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus. objectives: the aim of the study was to assess the malodor using the organoleptic method and tanita device; to quantify odoriferous microorganisms of subgingival plaque and tongue coating, such as p. gingivalis (pg), t. forsythia (tf), and f. nucleatum (fn) using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in nondiabetic and diabetic chronic periodontitis patients. patients and methods: thirty chronic periodontitis patients (with and without diabetes) with 5-7 mm pocket depth, radiographic evidence of bone loss, and presence of oral malodor participated in this study. subjective assessment of mouth air was done organoleptically and by using a portable sulfide monitor. tongue coating was also assessed. results: the scores of plaque index, gingival index, gingival bleeding  index, vsc levels, and tongue coating between the nondiabetic and diabetic patients were not significant (p>0.5). in nondiabetic patients, fn was found to be significantly (p<0.5) more in tongue samples, whereas pg and tf have not shown significant values (p>0.5). in diabetic patients, fn and tf have shown significant (p<0.5) an increase in subgingival and tongue samples, respectively,  whereas pg has not shown significant difference between subgingival and tongue samples. interpretation and conclusion: the results confirm that there is no difference in clinical parameters between nondiabetic and diabetic periodontitis  patients, but the odoriferous microbial profiles in tongue samples of diabetic patients were found to be high. however, there is a weak positive correlation between vsc levels, clinical parameters, and odoriferous microbial profiles.

TI  == comparative evaluation of two structurally related flavonoids, isoliquiritigenin  and liquiritigenin, for their oral infection therapeutic potential.
AB  == isoliquiritigenin (1) and liquiritigenin (2) are structurally related flavonoids  found in a variety of plants. the purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of biological properties of these compounds in regard to their therapeutic potential for oral infections. compound 1 demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against three major periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. in  contrast, 2 exerted less pronounced effects on the above bacterial species. neither compound was effective against cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans  and streptococcus sobrinus). furthermore, 1 exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity than 2 toward p. gingivalis collagenase and human matrix metalloproteinase 9. finally, the capacity of 1 to attenuate the inflammatory response of macrophages induced by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (lps) was much higher when compared to 2. the activation of transcriptional factors nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) p65 and activator protein-1 (ap-1) associated with the lps-induced inflammatory response in macrophages was inhibited strongly by 1, but less affected by 2.

TI  == efficacy of chlorhexidine digluconate-containing formulations and other mouthrinses against periodontopathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == objective: to determine in vitro the action of chlorhexidine digluconate and different commercially available mouthrinses on oral microorganisms. method and materials: minimal inhibitory concentrations and possible induction of resistance by chlorhexidine digluconate, an essential oil-containing mouthwash and an amine  fluoride/stannous fluoride solution, were determined against microorganisms normally found in the oral cavity (10 streptococci, 2 enterobacteria, 1 candida albicans, 8 porphyromonas gingivalis, 6 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and 1 fusobacterium nucleatum). further, the effect of a 1-minute exposure on cell and bacterial viability was studied. results: the susceptibility of the oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine digluconate ranged from 0.01% to 0.50%. passages  on agar plates containing subinhibitory concentrations of chlorhexidine digluconate resulted in a transitory moderate increase in the tolerance to chlorhexidine digluconate in five of the 24 isolates. after 1 minute of exposure, chlorhexidine digluconate solutions as well as the essential oil and the amine/stannous fluoride-containing solutions showed a high activity against the tested microorganisms. commercially available chlorhexidine digluconate formulations (ie, those with antidiscoloration systems) were partly less efficient than the corresponding manually prepared chlorhexidine digluconate preparation. the determination of mtt resulted in a strong cytotoxicity of all tested preparations to gingival fibroblasts. conclusion: the results indicate that most of the chlorhexidine digluconate formulations as well as essential oil  and the amine fluoride/stannous fluoride solutions are active against oral microbes. long-term use of these agents would not result in emergent antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == microbiological aspects of human mandibular subperiosteal dental implants.
AB  == clinical, microbiological, and biochemical features of human mandibular subperiosteal dental implants exhibiting peri-implantitis were compared with those experiencing long-term peri-implant health. after evaluation of clinical parameters, submucosal plaque samples were obtained from permucosal implant abutment posts exhibiting probing depths >/=5 mm and bleeding on probing in subjects with peri-implantitis (n = 3) and from posts with peri-implant health in subjects with long-term subperiosteal implant health (n = 8). the microbial specimens were transported in vmga iii and plated onto enriched brucella blood agar and hammond's selective medium with anaerobic incubation, and onto selective tsbv with 5% co2 incubation. total anaerobic viable counts and selected bacterial species were identified using established phenotypic methods and criteria. in vitro resistance to doxycycline (2 mug/ml), amoxicillin (2 mug/ml), or metronidazole (4 mug/ml) was recorded per subject when bacterial pathogen growth  was noted on antibiotic-supplemented isolation plates. interleukin (il)-1beta levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in peri-implant crevicular fluid samples from 5 study subjects. significantly higher plaque index scores, higher total anaerobic viable counts, more red complex species, and lower proportions of gram-positive facultative viridans streptococci and actinomyces species were detected on peri-implantitis-affected subperiosteal implants as compared with subperiosteal implants with long-term peri-implant health. no in vitro resistance to the 3 test antibiotic breakpoint concentrations studied was found, except a fusobacterium nucleatum strain resistant to doxycycline at 2 mug/ml from 1 peri-implantitis subject. subperiosteal implants with peri-implantitis tended to yield higher peri-implant crevicular fluid il-1beta levels. the level of peri-implant supramucosal plaque control and the composition of the peri-implant submucosal microbiome may be important determinants of the long-term clinical status of mandibular subperiosteal dental implants.

TI  == [prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by real-time pcr in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

TI  == efficacy of taurolidine against periodontopathic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect of taurolidine was tested against periodontopathic species in comparison to chlorhexidine digluconate in the presence or absence of  serum. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), microbiocidal concentrations (mbc), as well as killing were determined against 32 different microbial strains  including 3 porphyromonas gingivalis, 3 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and 15 potentially superinfecting species with and without 25% v/v human serum. the mic(50) of taurolidine against the tested microbial strains was 0.025% and the mic(90) 0.05%. the respective values for the mbcs were 0.05% and 0.1%. addition of 25% serum (heat-inactivated) did not change the mic and mbc values of taurolidine. in contrast, mics and mbcs of chlorhexidine (chx) increased by two steps after addition of serum. taurolidine killed microorganisms in a concentration and time-dependent manner, the killing rate of 1.6% taurolidine was 99.08% +/- 2.27% in mean after 2 h. again, killing activity of taurolidine was not affected if serum was added, whereas addition of inactivated serum clearly reduced the killing rate of all selected bacterial strains by chx. therefore, taurolidine possesses antimicrobial properties which are not reduced in the presence of serum as a main component in gingival crevicular fluid and wound fluid. taurolidine may have potential as an antimicrobial agent in non-surgical and surgical periodontal treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of adjunctive use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse in untreated gingivitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of chlorhexidine mouthrinse (chx) in addition to daily plaque control on subgingival microbiota in patients with untreated gingivitis. fifty gingivitis patients were randomized to  chx or placebo groups. chx group rinsed with 0.2% chx, while placebo group rinsed with placebo mouthrinse for 4 weeks. subgingival plaque samples were collected and plaque index (pi), papilla bleeding index (pbi), calculus index, and probing  pocket depth (ppd) were recorded at baseline and at 4 weeks. the amounts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and total bacteria were detected by quantitative real-time pcr method. in the chx group the total bacteria count was significantly reduced in posterior teeth at 4 weeks (p < 0.05), while no significant decrease was observed in the placebo group (p > 0.05). chx mouthrinse as an adjunct to daily plaque control could be useful in the management of plaque-associated gingivitis and in reducing the subgingival total bacteria count especially in posterior teeth.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

TI  == interaction of oral bacteria with gingival epithelial cell multilayers.
AB  == primary gingival epithelial cells were cultured in multilayers as a model for the study of interactions with oral bacteria associated with health and periodontal disease. multilayers maintained at an air-liquid interface in low-calcium medium  displayed differentiation and cytokeratin properties characteristic of junctional epithelium. multilayers were infected with fluorescently labeled porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum or streptococcus gordonii, and bacterial association was determined by confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. porphyromonas gingivalis invaded intracellularly and spread from cell to cell; a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum remained extracellular and showed intercellular movement through the multilayer; whereas s. gordonii remained extracellular and predominantly associated with the superficial cell layer. none of the bacterial species disrupted barrier function as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance.  p. gingivalis did not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. however, a.  actinomycetemcomitans and s. gordonii induced interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), il-6 and il-8 secretion; and f. nucleatum stimulated production of il-1beta and tnf-alpha. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and s. gordonii, but not p. gingivalis, increased levels of apoptosis after 24 h infection. the results indicate that the organisms with pathogenic potential were able to traverse the epithelium, whereas the commensal bacteria did not. in addition, distinct host responses characterized the interaction between the junctional epithelium and oral bacteria.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == antigenicity of primary endodontic infection against macrophages by the levels of pge(2) production.
AB  == introduction: root canal contents are potent stimuli for proinflammatory cytokines involved in apical periodontitis. this study investigated target gram-negative bacterial species and endotoxins in primary endodontic infection with apical periodontitis, determined their antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of pge(2), and evaluated their relationship with clinical findings. methods: samples were taken from 21 root canals with primary infection  and apical periodontitis by using paper points. polymerase chain reaction (16s rdna) was used for bacterial detection and limulus amebocyte lysate assay for endotoxin measurement. levels of prostaglandin e2 (pge(2)) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (duoset kit; r&d, minneapolis, mn). results: prevotella nigrescens (13/21), fusobacterium nucleatum (6/21), and porphyromonas  endodontalis (6/21) were the most frequently observed species. a positive association was found between f. nucleatum and p. endodontalis (p < .05). a correlation was found between the number of gram-negative bacterial species and the levels of endotoxins, such as pge(2) (p < .05). higher levels of endotoxin were detected in teeth with exudation, whereas elevated levels of pge(2) were found in teeth with tenderness to percussion and pain on palpation. conclusions:  our findings imply an additive effect between the number of gram-negative bacterial species involved in endodontic infection regarding the induction of proinflammatory cytokine by macrophage cells. moreover, teeth with clinical symptomatology were related to higher levels of endotoxins and pge(2) secretion.

TI  == influence of topography and hydrophilicity on initial oral biofilm formation on microstructured titanium surfaces in vitro.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the microtopography and hydrophilicity of titanium (ti) substrates on initial oral biofilm formation. materials and methods: nine bacterial species belonging to the normal oral microbiota, including: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces israelii, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus sanguinis were tested on ti surfaces: pretreatment (pt [r(a) <0.2 mum]), acid-etched (a [r(a) <0.8 mum]), a modified to be hydrophilic (moda), sand-blasted/acid-etched (sla [r(a) =4 mum]), and hydrophilic sla (modsla). disks were incubated for 24 h in anaerobic conditions using a normal culture medium (cm) or human saliva (hs). the total counts of bacteria and the proportion of each bacterial species were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: higher counts of bacteria were observed on all surfaces incubated with cm compared with the samples incubated with hs. pt, sla, and modsla exhibited higher numbers of attached bacteria in cm, whereas sla and modsla had a significant increase in bacterial adhesion in hs. the proportion of the species in the initial biofilms was also influenced by the surface properties and the media used: sla and modsla increased the proportion of species like a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. sanguinis in both media, while the adhesion of a. israelii and p. gingivalis on the same surfaces was affected in the presence of saliva. conclusions: the initial biofilm formation and composition were affected  by the microtopography and hydrophilicity of the surface and by the media used.

TI  == microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development in the absence of oral hygiene in periodontal health and disease.
AB  == aim: to monitor microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development. materials  and methods: supra- and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28  teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects at baseline and immediately after tooth cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants during 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. species counts were averaged within subjects at each time point. significant differences in the counts between healthy and periodontitis subjects were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: the total supra- and subgingival counts were significantly higher in periodontitis on entry and reached or exceeded the baseline values after day 2. supragingival counts of veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and neisseria mucosa increased from 2 to 7 days. subgingival counts were greater  for actinomyces, green and orange complex species. significant differences between groups in supragingival counts occurred for 17 of 41 species at entry, 0  at day 7; for subgingival plaque, these values were 39/41 taxa at entry, 17/41 at day 7. conclusions: supragingival plaque re-development was similar in periodontitis and health, but subgingival species recolonization was more marked  in periodontitis.

TI  == detection of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: in recent years, increasing evidence regarding the potential association between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases has been identified. the available evidence underlines the importance of detecting periodontal pathogens on atheromatous plaque as the first step in demonstrating the causal relationship between the two conditions. the main aim of this investigation is to detect periodontitis-associated bacteria from carotid artery  atheromatous plaque from patients who received an endarterectomy using strict sample procurement and laboratory procedures. methods: atheromatous plaque from endarterectomies from carotid arteries were scraped and homogenized, and bacterial dna was extracted. to obtain a representative concentration of amplicons, two amplifications of the bacterial 16s ribosomal-rna gene were carried out for each sample with universal eubacteria primers by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). a nested pcr with specific primers for the target bacteria  was performed next. statistical tests included the chi(2) test. results: forty-two atheromatous plaque were analyzed. all of them were positive for >/=1 target bacterial species. the bacterial species most commonly found was porphyromonas gingivalis (78.57%; 33 of 42), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (66.67%;  28 of 42), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (61.90%; 26 of 42),  eikenella corrodens (54.76%; 23 of 42), fusobacterium nucleatum (50.00%; 21 of 42), and campylobacter rectus (9.52%; four of 42). the simultaneous presence of various bacterial species within the same specimen was a common observation. conclusion: within the limitations of this study, the presence of dna from periodontitis-associated bacteria in carotid artery atheromatous plaque retrieved by endarterectomy is confirmed.

TI  == novel model for multispecies biofilms that uses rigid gas-permeable lenses.
AB  == oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. to provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host  cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (rgpls), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. bacterial species belonging  to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or  three-species biofilms, with each group comprising streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis; s. gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, and fusobacterium nucleatum; or s. gordonii, f. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative pcr (qpcr) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in  single-species and multispecies biofilms. we evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and hoechst 33258 and novel syto red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy  (clsm). substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. the specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == myrsinoic acid b inhibits the production of hydrogen sulfide by periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == recently, we reported that myrsinoic acid b purified from myrsine seguinii inhibited methyl mercaptan (ch(3)sh) production by fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. since hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) is the main component of physiological halitosis, while ch(3)sh is involved in pathological oral halitosis, the objective of this study is to determine whether myrsinoic acid b inhibits h(2)s production by oral microorganisms. f. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were incubated with myrsinoic acid b and a substrate such as  l-cysteine or l-methionine. h(2)s or ch(3)sh concentration in the headspace air,  was determined using a gas chromatograph. the concentration of myrsinoic acid b inhibiting 50% (ic(50)) of h(2)s production by f. nucleatum was 0.142 microg ml(-1), and the ic(50) of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were 2.71 microg ml(-1)  and 28.9 microg ml(-1), respectively. the presence of pyruvate, a by-product of h(2)s production, was determined. the ic(50) values of myrsinoic acid b for pyruvate production were 22.9 microg ml(-1) for f. nucleatum, 87.7 microg ml(-1)  for p. gingivalis and 165 microg ml(-1) for t. denticola. we concluded that myrsinoic acid b inhibited the production of both h(2)s and pyruvate by periodontal pathogens.

TI  == rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique (roqt) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB  == approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. the aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. oligonucleotides targeting the 16s ribosomal dna gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. these probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as tm7 sp. ot 346, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041. sensitivity and  specificity of the probes were determined. a universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a ccd camera. in a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and actinomyces gerencseriae were  the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. among uncultivated/unrecognized species, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and prevotella sp. ot 306 were the most numerous. porphyromonas gingivalis and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. direct hybridization of total  nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.

AB  == background: the direct effect of periodontal pathogens on atherosclerotic plaque  development has been suggested as a potential mechanism for the observed association between periodontal disease and coronary heart disease, but few studies have tested this theory. objectives: (i) to assess the association of periodontal pathogens in periodontal pockets with the risk of myocardial infarction (mi) and (ii) to assess whether an increase in the number of periodontal bacterial species increases the risk of mi. methods: a total of 313 cases and 747 controls, consisting of caucasian men and women from western new york, aged 35 to 69 years, were recruited for this study. the presence of microorganisms was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, using species-specific polyclonal and monoclonal serodiagnostic reagents. the presence  of six periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), campylobacter recta (cr), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), and eubacterium saburreum (es), and their co-occurrence (0-6) was compared with the odds of having myocardial infarction. results: univariate analyses revealed a higher percentage of the presence of each bacterium in cases compared to controls. in multivariate analyses, only tf and pi were statistically associated with an increase in the odds of having mi [odds ratio or=1.62; 95% ci (1.18-2.22); and 1.40; 95% (1.02-1.92), respectively] after adjusting for age, gender, education, cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and total pack-years of cigarette smoking. an increase in the number of different periodontal bacteria in pockets was also found to increase the odds of mi [adjusted or=1.14; 95% ci (1.03-1.26)]. participants who had three species or more of periodontal pathogens had about 2-fold increase in odds of having nonfatal mi than those who did not have any type of bacterial species [or=2.01 (1.31-3.08)]. conclusion: the presence of periodontal pathogens, specifically tf  or pi, and an increase in total burden of periodontal pathogenic species were both associated with increased odds of having mi. however, further studies are needed to better assess any causal relationship, as well as the biological mechanisms underlying this association.

TI  == short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: this study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (c1), acetic acid (c2), propionic acid (c3), butyric acid (c4), isobutyric acid (c4), isovaleric acid (c5), hexanoic acid (c6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (c8), capric acid (c10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (c14), palmitic acid (c16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared  related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. as a group the fatty acids were much less effective against c. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive  against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. conclusions: the results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (scfas), medium-chain fatty acids (mcfas), long-chain fatty acids (lcfas) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. first, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.

TI  == effect of non-surgical treatment on chronic and aggressive periodontitis: clinical, immunologic, and microbiologic findings.
AB  == background: our goal was to examine differences in clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic responses to non-surgical mechanical therapy in patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (gcp) and generalized aggressive periodontitis  (gagp). methods: twenty patients with gcp and 14 patients with gagp were evaluated. clinical data, gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline and 3 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment. levels of 40 subgingival species were measured using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. gcf interleukin (il)-1beta, -4, and -8 and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) were analyzed using a multiplexed bead immunoassay,  and elastase activity was measured using an enzymatic assay. the significance of  changes with time was examined using the wilcoxon rank sum test. changes in clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters after therapy were compared between groups using the mann-whitney u test. results: after periodontal therapy, we found significant improvements for all clinical parameters in both groups. we  also observed significant reductions in elastase activity in shallow and deep sites from the gagp group and in deep sites from the gcp group. microbiologic data showed significant reductions in proportions of orange and red complexes and an increase in proportions of actinomyces species in both clinical groups. when the clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic responses after therapy were compared between groups, only minor differences were found. conclusion: this study fails to show any significant differences between severe forms of gcp and gagp in response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == salivary infectious agents and periodontal disease status.
AB  == background and objectives: the potential of salivary microorganisms to diagnose periodontal disease and to guide periodontal treatment is a research topic of current interest. this study aimed to determine whether the salivary counts of periodontopathic microbes correlated with the periodontal pocket counts of the same infectious agents, and whether the salivary counts of the test infectious agents could distinguish among individuals with periodontal health and various types of periodontal disease. material and methods: the study included 150 systemically healthy adults, of whom 37 were periodontally healthy, 31 had gingivitis, 46 had chronic periodontitis and 36 had aggressive periodontitis. each study subject contributed microbial samples from the two deepest periodontal pockets of the dentition and from whole saliva. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and epstein-barr virus were identified using the taqman real-time pcr methodology. statistical analysis was performed using the mann-whitney u-test and the receiver operating characteristic statistics. results: c. rectus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. forsythia occurred with significantly higher copy-counts in salivary samples from patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis than from periodontally healthy individuals. a. actinomycetemcomitans only showed higher salivary copy-counts in  subjects with aggressive periodontitis compared with subjects with healthy periodontium, and the salivary copy-counts of epstein-barr virus did not reveal any significant difference among the four subject groups studied. the diagnostic  sensitivity for periodontitis was 89.19 for p. gingivalis and for t. forsythia and 86.49 for p. intermedia, with specificities ranging from 83.78 to 94.59. the  optimal copy-counts per ml saliva for identifying periodontitis were 40,000 for p. gingivalis, 700,000 for t. forsythia and 910,000 for p. intermedia. conclusion: salivary copy-counts of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and p. intermedia appear to have the potential to identify the presence of periodontitis, whereas the salivary level of the other test infectious agents may possess little or no diagnostic utility. longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the ability of salivary copy-counts of major periodontopathic bacteria to predict future periodontal breakdown.

TI  == epigenetic regulation of human beta-defensin 2 and cc chemokine ligand 20 expression in gingival epithelial cells in response to oral bacteria.
AB  == gingival epithelia utilize multiple signaling pathways to regulate innate immune  responses to various oral bacteria, but little is understood about how these bacteria alter epithelial epigenetic status. in this study we report that dna methyltransferase (dnmt1) and histone deacetylase expression were decreased in gingival epithelial cells treated with oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis and nonpathogen fusobacterium nucleatum. pretreatment with trichostatin a and sodium  butyrate, which increase acetylation of chromatin histones, significantly enhanced the gene expression of antimicrobial proteins human beta-defensin 2 (hbd2) and cc chemokine ligand 20 (ccl20) in response to both bacterial challenges. pretreatment with dnmt inhibitor 5'-azacytidine increased hbd2 and ccl20 expression in response to f. nucleatum, but not to p. gingivalis. furthermore, we observed a differential pattern of protein levels of h3k4me3, which has been associated with chromatin remodeling and activation of gene transcription, in response to p. gingivalis vs. f. nucleatum. this study provides a new insight into the bacteria-specific innate immune responses via epigenetic regulation.

TI  == effects of toluidine blue-mediated photodynamic therapy on periopathogens and periodontal biofilm: in vitro evaluation.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) is a selective modality of killing targeted cells, mostly known for its application in neoplasms. pdt can be considered to be an alternative method for the elimination of periodontal bacteria from the pocket without harms for the resident tissues. therefore, pdt may replace systemic antibiotics and enhance the effect of mechanical treatments of periodontal defects. this effort focused on the in vitro sensitization of periopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia ) toluidine blue mediated and on the use of a diode laser emitting source. the objective of this research was to evaluate the bactericidal in vitro effect of laser diodes 830 nm (as the light source) after photosensitization with toluidine blue (tbo) on the following periopathogenic bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia. after evaluating the effect on the single bacterial strain, the ability of diode laser to disrupt the structure  of biofilms produced by a. actinomycetemcomitans after photosensitization with tbo was also analyzed. the study suggests that the association of tbo and diode laser light 830 nm is effective for the killing of bacteria strains and determines the photoinactivation of aggregatibacter biofilms. in summary, photodynamic therapy has effectively shown its capabilities and, therefore, it can be considered a valid alternative approach to antimicrobial therapy of periodontitis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  == recently, the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. the current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. a number of representatives from the bdellovibrio, bacteriovorax and peredibacter lineages (called 'balos') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. as the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon,  it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of balos. it was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. this finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for  balos to combat periodontal pathogens.

TI  == predation of oral pathogens by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the  destruction of the periodontal structures. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. it was previously shown that b. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. in this study, we examined the host specificity of b. bacteriovorus strain 109j and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. we further demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus 109j has an ability to remove biofilms of ei.  corrodens as well as biofilms composed of a. actinomycetemcomitans. bdellovibrio  bacteriovorus was able to remove a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of b. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-k inhibits predation. however, treating a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with dspb, a poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. increased biofilm removal was also recorded when a. actinomycetemcomitans pga-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that pga degradation could enhance the removal of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by b. bacteriovorus.

AB  == objective: to compare the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma to assess the  ability of common oral anaerobic bacteria isolated from the kuwaiti population to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). materials and methods: broth cultures of common anaerobes isolated from supragingival plaque were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in phosphate buffer (ph 7.7) with an optical density od(550)  of 0.3. 100 mul of this suspension and 870 mul of buffer were added in 2 sterile  15-ml head space vials. reaction was initiated by addition of 30 mul of 33 mml-methionine and l-cysteine, respectively, in each vial and incubation at 37 degrees c for 90 min. 500 mul of 3 m phosphoric acid was added to tubes and was kept aside for 10 min. production of vscs was measured using the halimeter and the oral chroma. results: the major vsc producers identified by both halimeter and oral chroma with l-cystenine as substrate were campylobacter ureolyticus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and gemella morbillorum. the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide recorded by both halimeter and oral chroma were essentially identical. with l-methionine as substrate, both halimeter and oral chroma identified different complements of anaerobes with c. ureolyticus,p. gingivalis,fusobacterium nucleatum and p. intermedia as major vsc producers. the  concentrations of methyl mercaptan recorded by the halimeter were lower compared  to those assessed by the oral chroma. conclusion: the results suggest that the oral chroma may produce a more comprehensive assessment of vsc production by oral microflora than the halimeter.

TI  == antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of 4-hydroxycordoin: potential therapeutic benefits.
AB  == 4-hydroxycordoin (1), a natural isopentenyloxychalcone, is a plant secondary metabolite that is relatively rare. since there are very few reports about the biological activities of 1, its potential benefits for periodontal disease were investigated. a marked and dose-dependent antibacterial activity of 1 was observed against the three major periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. moreover, compound 1 showed an antiadhesion effect, since it inhibited attachment of p. gingivalis to oral epithelial cells. finally, using a macrophage model, the ability of 1 to inhibit  the secretion of inflammatory mediators induced by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide was demonstrated. the anti-inflammatory  effect observed was associated with reduced activation of the nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) p65 and activator protein-1 (ap-1) pathways.

TI  == systemic inflammatory responses in progressing periodontitis during pregnancy in  a baboon model.
AB  == this study tested the hypothesis that pregnant female baboons exhibit increased levels of various inflammatory mediators in serum resulting from ligature-induced periodontitis, and that these profiles would relate to periodontal disease severity/extent in the animals. the animals were sampled at baseline (b), mid-pregnancy (mp; two quadrants ligated) and at delivery (d; four quadrants ligated). all baboons developed increased plaque, gingival inflammation and bleeding, pocket depths and attachment loss following placement of the ligatures. by mp, both prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) and bactericidal permeability inducing factor (bpi) were greater than baseline, while increased levels of interleukin (il)-6 occurred in the experimental animals by the time of delivery. il-8, mcp-1  and lbp all decreased from baseline through the ligation phase of the study. stratification of the animals by baseline clinical presentation demonstrated that pge(2), lbp, il-8 and mcp-1 levels were altered throughout the ligation interval, irrespective of baseline clinical values. il-6, il-8 and lbp were significantly lower in the subset of animals that demonstrated the least clinical response to ligation, indicative of progressing periodontal disease. pge(2), macrophage chemotactic protein (mcp)-1, regulated upon activation, normal t cell expressed and secreted (rantes) and lbp were decreased in the most diseased subset of animals at delivery. systemic antibody responses to fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and campylobacter  rectus were associated most frequently with variations in inflammatory mediator levels. these results provide a profile of systemic inflammatory mediators during ligature-induced periodontitis in pregnant baboons. the relationship of the oral  clinical parameters to systemic inflammatory responses is consistent with a contribution to adverse pregnancy outcomes in a subset of the animals.

TI  == intracellular degradation of fusobacterium nucleatum in human gingival epithelial cells.
AB  == the role of fusobacterium nucleatum in oral health and disease is controversial.  we have previously shown that f. nucleatum invades gingival epithelial cells. however, the destiny of the internalized f. nucleatum is not clear. in the present study, the intracellular destiny of f. nucleatum and its cytopathic effect on gingival epithelial cells were studied. the ability of f. nucleatum and seven other oral bacterial species to invade immortalized human gingival epithelial (hok-16b) cells were compared by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. f. nucleatum had the highest invasive capacity, comparable to that of  porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen. confocal microscopic examination revealed colocalization of internalized f. nucleatum with endosomes and lysosomes. examination by transmission electron microscopy revealed that most intracellular f. nucleatum was located within vesicular structures with single enclosed membranes. furthermore, f. nucleatum could not survive within gingival epithelial cells and had no cytopathic effects on host cells. interestingly, endosomal maturation played a role in induction of the antimicrobial peptides human beta defensin (hbd)-2 and -3 by f. nucleatum from gingival epithelial cells. f. nucleatum is destined to enter an endocytic degradation pathway after invasion and has no cytopathic effect on gingival epithelial cells, which may cast new light on the role of f. nucleatum in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

AB  == aim: to compare the early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health of mucosa adjacent to zirconia (zro(2)) and titanium (ti) abutment surfaces in vivo. materials and methods: twenty edentulous subjects received two endosseous mandibular implants. the implants were fitted with either a zro(2) or a ti abutment (non-submerged implant placement, within-subject comparison, left-right  randomization). sulcular bacterial sampling and the assessment of probing pocket  depth, recession and bleeding on probing were performed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-surgery. wilcoxon matched-pairs, sign-rank tests were applied to test differences in the counts of seven marker bacteria and the clinical parameters that were associated with the zro(2) and ti abutments, at the two observation time points. results: zro(2) and ti abutments harboured similar counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola at 2 weeks and 3 months. healthy clinical conditions were seen around both zro(2) and ti abutments at all times, without significant differences in most clinical parameters of peri-implant soft tissue health. mean probing depths around ti abutments were slightly deeper than around  zro(2) abutments after 3 months (2.2 sd 0.8 mm vs. 1.7 sd 0.7 mm, p=0.03). conclusions: no difference in health of the soft tissues adjacent to zro(2) and ti abutment surfaces or in early bacterial colonization could be demonstrated, although somewhat shallower probing depths were observed around zro(2) abutments  after 3 month.

AB  == objective: the photodynamic therapy (pdt) is an alternative method to suppress oral pathogens by the activation of a photosensitizer with laser light. the aim of this study was to investigate the phototoxic effect of three ruthenium-based photosensitizers on fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: in this in vitro study f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis were incubated with three photosensitizers: (i) a hydrophobic tris-(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)-ruthenium(ii)-dication (rd3), (ii) a hydrophilic tris-[(1,10-phenanthroline-4,7-diyl)-bis-(benzenesulfonato)]-ruthenate tetra-anion (rsd3) and (iii) a lower hydrophilic tris-(2,2'-bipyridine)-ruthenium(ii) dication (rby). the subsequent irradiation was done with blue-band halogen light (450-485nm) for 20s using a conventional polymerizer. control samples consisted of bacterial cell suspension irradiated and non-irradiated in the absence of photosensitizer or incubated with the photosensitizer without irradiation. bacterial inactivation was determined by the numbers of colony-forming units (cfu/ml) after anaerobic cultivation. results: the rd3 photosensitizer reduced the viability of f. nucleatum by 4-log10 and of p. gingivalis completely after irradiation for 20s. the viability loss correlated significantly with the concentration of the rd3 photosensitizer and reached a peak at a concentration of 12.5mum (p<0.05). the rsd3 and rby photosensitizers had distinctly lower phototoxic effects in comparison to rd3. conclusion: the rd3 photosensitizer showed a phototoxic effect on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. the results suggest that the application of the rd3 photosensitizer under visible light may be helpful as an adjunct treatment approach to the inactivation of periodontopathogenic bacteria.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

AB  == aim: supportive therapy to maintain dental implants is increasingly important. this study examined the effect of a 0.3% triclosan/2% copolymer dentifrice on oral biofilms and gingival inflammation (gi) on dental implants and peri-implant  tissues. materials and methods: one hundred and twenty adults with a dental implant and contra-lateral tooth were enrolled in this 6 month, double-blind, two-treatment, parallel group study. sixty subjects were randomly assigned to a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice test group and 60 subjects to a fluoride dentifrice control group and instructed to brush twice daily for 6 months. at baseline, 3, and 6 months, a calibrated dentist assessed dental plaque, gi and collected supragingival dental plaque for microbiological analysis. results: subjects in the triclosan/copolymer group demonstrated significantly lower levels of dental plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding on probing at 3 and 6 months at both the implant and contra-lateral tooth compared with the fluoride group (p<0.05). there were significantly fewer gram-negative anaerobes in the triclosan/copolymer group (p<0.05) including >90% reductions in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, solobacterium moorei, and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: twice daily use of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice may enhance dental implant maintenance by reducing dental plaque and gi.

TI  == polybacterial challenge effects on cytokine/chemokine production by macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == objective: to investigate the polymicrobial infection of periodontal disease, which elicits inflammatory mediators/cytokines/chemokines in the local gingival tissues, and a polybacterial challenge of antigen-presenting cells, e.g. macrophages and dendritic cells (dcs), at the mucosal surface. materials and methods: the cytokine/chemokine profiles of human macrophages and dcs in response to polybacterial challenges were investigated. results: oral gram-negative bacteria elicited significantly greater il-8 levels from macrophages, compared to gram-positive bacteria. gram-positive bacteria did not show synergism in inducing this chemokine from macrophages. in contrast, pairs of oral gram-negative bacteria elicited synergistic production of il-8 by macrophages. similar results  were not observed with tnfalpha, which only appeared additive with the polybacterial challenge. selected gram-negative bacterial pairs synergized in il-6 production by immature dcs. in mature dcs (mdcs), a porphyromonas gingivalis/fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas intermedia/f. nucleatum polybacterial challenge resulted in significant synergism for il-6 and tnfalpha levels. however, only the pi/fn combination synergized for il-12 production and there appeared to be no polybacterial effect on il-10 production by the mdcs. conclusions: these results indicate that a polybacterial challenge of cells linking innate and adaptive immune responses results in varied response profiles  that are dependent upon the characteristics of the microorganisms that are components of the polybacterial complex.

TI  == vaccination of mice with porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum modulates the inflammatory response, but fails to prevent experimental periodontitis.
AB  == aim: to assess the potential of using vaccination with porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum, in modulating local subcutaneous inflammatory response and alveolar bone loss following coinfection with both bacteria. materials and methods: mice were immunized against either p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. the cytokine response to mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum was evaluated using the subcutaneous chamber model. the alveolar bone loss induced by oral mixed infection was evaluated by micro-ct using the experimental periodontitis model. serum levels of specific antibodies were determined by elisa. results: vaccination with either bacterium produced a specific humoral response before infection. animals immunized against either bacteria following a mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, showed  decreased tnfalpha (but not il-1beta) levels as compared with non-immunized animals. however, the vaccination did not change the level of mixed infection-induced alveolar bone loss when compared with non-immunized animals. six weeks following the oral mixed infection, specific antibody titres remained high. furthermore, specific antibodies against the non-immunized bacterium were present at high levels. conclusions: while vaccination produced specific antibodies and suppressed the inflammatory response, it failed to prevent or reduce the progression of experimental periodontitis induced by mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.

TI  == energy dose parameters affect antimicrobial photodynamic therapy-mediated eradication of periopathogenic biofilm and planktonic cultures.
AB  == objective: this study evaluated the in vitro efficacy of a commercially available apdt system in eradication of the periopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. background data: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) is an effective antibacterial approach in vitro; however, few data are available regarding effective light-energy parameters. materials and methods: planktonic and biofilm cultures of periopathogens were exposed to a methylene blue-based formulation and irradiated with a 670-nm nonthermal diode laser. energy doses were varied from 2.3 to 9.4 j/cm(2) through adjustments in illumination time and a constant power density. controls consisted of no treatment, light only, and photosensitizer only. temperature changes were recorded in experimental samples before and after illumination. results: apdt with an energy dose of 9.4 j/cm(2) was effective in eradicating p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans in biofilm and planktonic form. reductions from control in planktonic cultures at this energy dose were 6.8 +/- 0.7, 5.2 +/- 0.6, and 1.9 +/- 0.6 log(10), respectively, whereas biofilm reductions were 4.5 +/- 1.2, 3.4 +/- 1.1, and 4.9 +/- 1.4 log(10). decreasing the treatment time produced an energy dose-dependent killing effect in both models. changes in sample temperature did not exceed 3 degrees c under these exposure parameters. conclusion: this study demonstrated that three important periopathogens are susceptible to apdt-mediated killing, regardless of whether they are present in planktonic or biofilm form. furthermore, a clear energy dose-dependence exists with this treatment that should to be taken into account when determining optimal treatment times in clinical application.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum regulation of neutrophil transcription.
AB  == background and objective: abnormal neutrophil responses have been observed in periodontitis patients, including hyper-reactivity in terms of production of reactive oxygen species (ros) following exposure to the key quorum-sensing plaque bacterium, fusobacterium nucleatum. this study was designed to characterize the transcriptional response of neutrophils to f. nucleatum. material and methods: peripheral blood neutrophils were exposed to f. nucleatum, and gene expression was analysed using high-throughput transcriptomics. results: microarray technology demonstrated differential expression of 208 genes (163 increased and 43 decreased relative to control genes), which identified regulation of several ontological classes, including signal transduction (13%), transcription regulation (7%) and ros response (14%). individual gene expression analysis of selected transcripts, including csf, cxcl3, fos, hmox1, hsp40, sod2, nfkb2 and gp91, in individual and pooled rna samples from control and f. nucleatum-exposed  neutrophils corroborated microarray data. analysis of ros generation, combined with transcript analysis, in response to a panel of proinflammatory stimuli (f. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and opsonized staphylococcus aureus) identified significant differences in ros and transcript regulatory control. further analyses of neutrophils from periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy control subjects stimulated with f. nucleatum  indicated significant differential induction of several ros response-related transcripts. conclusion: these data demonstrate that neutrophils are transcriptionally active in response to the periodontal pathogen f. nucleatum and that these changes in gene expression are likely to affect neutrophil function. the differential response of neutrophils to a range of stimuli combined with data demonstrating differences between patient and control neutrophils indicate the importance of this cell and its interaction with the local tissue environment in  the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == microbiota around teeth and dental implants in periodontally healthy, partially edentulous patients: is pre-implant microbiological testing relevant?
AB  == this study aimed to assess the prevalence of seven periodontal marker pathogens,  before implant placement and 1 yr after loading, in periodontally healthy individuals and to assess the long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of pathogens to below threshold levels. in 93 individuals needing single tooth replacement, pooled subgingival microbiological samples from standard sites were  cultured and analyzed before implant treatment and 1 yr after loading. threshold  levels commonly used in periodontology to predict periodontal breakdown were applied. subjects with levels of pathogens above these thresholds received initial periodontal treatment including systemic antibiotics when indicated. at baseline, 49.5% of periodontally healthy subjects harboured one or more marker pathogens above threshold levels. periodontal treatment reduced the pathogen levels below threshold values in 78.3% of these initially colonized subjects. in  all cases aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were reduced to below threshold. at 1 yr after loading, periodontal pathogens were present above threshold levels in 74.1% of all subjects. it is concluded that in  almost half of periodontal healthy individuals the subgingival biofilm harbours periodontal pathogens above threshold values. long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of the selected marker pathogens appeared limited in our patient population, making pre-implant reduction unpredictive for post-implant levels of these pathogens. thus, considering the applied microbiological criteria, generalized pre-implant microbiological testing is not contributory in  periodontally healthy subjects.

AB  == objective: to investigate the adhesive and invasive ability of four common periodontal pathogens, pg33277, pi25611, aa29522 and fn10953 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec). methods: the model of infection of huvec by periodontal pathogens was established in vitro. the invasive ability of four periodontal pathogens in huvec was tested by scanning electron microscope (sem) and antibiotic protection assays-colony-forming units (cfu). results: all of the  four periodontal pathogens were found to adhere to huvec by sem and invaded huvec at invasion numbers of (0.8 +/- 0.1) x 10(8), (4.1 +/- 0.5) x 10(6), (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(6) and (5.0 +/- 0.4) x 10(6) cfu/l respectively by antibiotic protection assays-cfu. the invasion efficiencies were (0.400 +/- 0.050)%, (0.021  +/- 0.003)%, (0.008 +/- 0.002)% and (0.025 +/- 0.002)%, respectively. the invasive ability of pg33277 was significantly greater than those of the other three periodontal pathogens (p < 0.001). there was no difference in invasive abilities among pi25611, aa29522 and fn10953 (p > 0.05). conclusions: all of the  four common periodontal pathogens, pg33277, pi25611, aa29522 and fn10953 could adhere to and invaded huvec, with pg33277 being the strongest.

TI  == examination of periodontal pathogens in stenotic valve specimens and in whole blood samples in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. the influence of periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular diseases needs  further investigation. therefore, the aims of this clinical study are: to test the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in aortic valves and to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna in whole blood samples  in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis. nineteen consecutive patients (12 males and 7 females, age: 49-85 years) were enrolled in  this study after having been subjected to a complete periodontal evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. all patients were scheduled for aortic valve replacement surgery. after clinical and microbial periodontal examination, the aortic valve tissue specimens were obtained by excision during valve replacement surgery and the patients were subjected to the whole blood sampling before the surgery. the polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect the putative periodontal pathogens tannerella forshytia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens and treponema  denticola. neither the 19 aortic valve specimens nor the blood samples were positive for the genoma of the selected periodontal pathogens. the selected periodontal pathogens did not colonize the aortic valve of patients affected by stenosis and bacterial genoma was not present in whole blood samples. a high blood pressure at the aortic valve may prevent the adhesion and proliferation of  bacterial colonies.

TI  == differential and coordinated expression of defensins and cytokines by gingival epithelial cells and dendritic cells in response to oral bacteria.
AB  == background: epithelial cells and dendritic cells (dcs) both initiate and contribute to innate immune responses to bacteria. however, much less is known about the coordinated regulation of innate immune responses between gecs and immune cells, particularly dcs in the oral cavity. the present study was conducted to investigate whether their responses are coordinated and are bacteria-specific in the oral cavity. results: the beta-defensin antimicrobial peptides hbd1, hbd2 and hbd3 were expressed by immature dcs as well as gingival epithelial cells (gecs). hbd1, hbd2 and hbd3 are upregulated in dcs while hbd2 and hbd3 are upregulated in gecs in response to bacterial stimulation. responses  of both cell types were bacteria-specific, as demonstrated by distinctive profiles of hbds mrna expression and secreted cytokines and chemokines in response to cell wall preparations of various bacteria of different pathogenicity: fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii and porphyromonas  gingivalis. the regulation of expression of hbd2, il-8, cxcl2/grobeta and ccl-20/mip3alpha by gecs was greatly enhanced by conditioned medium from bacterially activated dcs. this enhancement was primarily mediated via il-1beta,  since induction was largely attenuated by il-1 receptor antagonist. in addition,  the defensins influence dcs by eliciting differential cytokine and chemokine secretion. hbd2 significantly induced il-6, while hbd3 induced mcp-1 to approximately the same extent as lps, suggesting a unique role in immune responses. conclusions: the results suggest that cytokines, chemokines and beta-defensins are involved in interaction of these two cell types, and the responses are bacteria-specific. differential and coordinated regulation between  gecs and dcs may be important in regulation of innate immune homeostasis and response to pathogens in the oral cavity.

TI  == hiv-1 reactivation induced by the periodontal pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis involves toll-like receptor 2 [corrected] and 9 activation in monocytes/macrophages.
AB  == although oral coinfections (e.g., periodontal disease) are highly prevalent in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-positive (hiv-1(+)) patients and appear to positively correlate with viral load levels, the potential for oral bacteria to induce hiv-1 reactivation in latently infected cells has received little attention. we showed that hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr) promoter activation can be induced by periodontopathogens in monocytes/macrophages; nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in this response remain undetermined. since toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), tlr4, and tlr9 activation have been involved in hiv-1 recrudescence, we sought to determine the role of these tlrs in hiv-1 reactivation induced by the periodontal pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis using bf24 monocytes/macrophages stably transfected with the hiv-1 promoter driving chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) expression and thp89gfp cells, a model of hiv-1 latency. we demonstrated that tlr9 activation by f. nucleatum and tlr2 activation by both bacteria appear to be involved in hiv-1  reactivation; however, tlr4 activation had no effect. moreover, the autocrine activity of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) but not interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) produced in response to bacteria could impact viral reactivation. the  transcription factors nf-kappab and sp1 appear to be positively regulating hiv-1  reactivation induced by these oral pathogens. these results suggest that oral gram-negative bacteria (f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis) associated with oral and  systemic chronic inflammatory disorders enhance hiv-1 reactivation in monocytes/macrophages through tlr2 and tlr9 activation in a mechanism that appears to be transcriptionally regulated. increased bacterial growth and emergence of these bacteria or their products accompanying chronic oral inflammatory diseases could be risk modifiers for viral replication, systemic immune activation, and aids progression in hiv-1(+) patients.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of subgingival species in chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == background and objective: the increasing rate of resistance of microorganisms to  penicillin and other antibiotics has generated concern among health authorities in latin america. the present investigation determined the in vitro susceptibility of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, black-pigmented prevotella spp. and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin and moxifloxacin in patients with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from patients with periodontitis were collected and cultured on selective and nonselective culture media. the antimicrobial susceptibility of periodontopathogenic isolates was studied in chronic periodontitis patients in colombia. metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were tested on all bacterial isolates and the percentage of resistant strains was calculated. results: of the 150 bacteria identified, 51 were p. gingivalis, 45 were black-pigmented prevotella spp., 36 were f. nucleatum and 18 were a. actinomycetemcomitans. all the isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid and to moxifloxacin, but exhibited variable susceptibility patterns to the other antimicrobial agents tested. conclusion: the results of the present study suggest that periodontal microorganisms in patients with chronic periodontitis can be resistant to the antimicrobial agents commonly used in anti-infective periodontal therapy. we suggest that the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials could result in the appearance of more highly antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria associated with periodontal diseases in our population compared with the populations of other countries.

TI  == gram-negative periodontal bacteria induce the activation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4, and cytokine production in human periodontal ligament cells.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a bacterially induced chronic inflammatory disease.  toll-like receptors (tlrs), which could recognize microbial pathogens, are important components in the innate and adaptive immune systems. both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses might result from different bacteria stimulation and the triggering of different tlrs. this study explores the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) with tlr2 and tlr4. methods: we studied the gene expression changes of tlr2 and tlr4 and cytokine production (interleukin-1beta, -6, -8, -10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in human periodontal ligament cells (hpdlcs) stimulated with heat-killed bacteria or p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) in the presence or absence of monoclonal antibodies to tlr2 or tlr4 (anti-tlr2/4 mab). results: both test bacteria and 10  microg/ml p. gingivalis lps treatment increased the gene expression of tlr2 and tlr4 and cytokine production in hpdlcs. in addition, these upregulations could be blocked by anti-tlr2/4 mab. however, the expression of tlr4 mrna in hpdlcs stimulated with 1 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps was not increased. no differences were found in the cytokine production caused by 1 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps treatment in the presence or absence of anti-tlr4 mab. conclusion: these patterns of gene expression and cytokine production indicate that gram-negative periodontal bacteria or their lps might play a role in triggering tlr2 and/or tlr4, and be of importance for the immune responses in periodontitis.

TI  == in vitro cytokine responses to periodontal pathogens: generalized aggressive periodontitis is associated with increased il-6 response to porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) is an inflammatory condition resulting in destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. we examined the production  of il-1beta, il-6, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, il-12 and il-10 in cultures of peripheral mononuclear cells (mnc) from 10 patients with gagp and 10  controls stimulated with periodontal pathogens or a control antigen, tetanus toxoid (tt) in the presence of autologous serum. the pathogens used were porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum, either as type strains or bacteria isolated from the participants' inherent oral  flora. the p. gingivalis -induced production of il-6 was approximately 2.5-fold higher in patients with gagp than in healthy controls (p < 0.05), while the corresponding tnf-alpha production was non-significantly elevated. il-1beta production induced by p. gingivalis, as all cytokine responses induced by pr. intermedia, f. nucleatum and tt was similar in the two groups. a reduced il-12p70 response to pr. intermedia and f. nucleatum was observed in smokers compared to non-smoking patients (p < 0.02). to assess the role of serum factors in the elevated il-6 response to p. gingivalis, mnc from two donors free of disease were stimulated with this bacterium in the presence of the various patient and control sera. an elevated il-6 and tnf-alpha response was observed in the presence of patient sera (p < 0.01 and p < 0.04, respectively). the data suggest that an exaggerated production of il-6 occurs in gagp, and that pro-inflammatory serum factors play an essential role in the response.

AB  == purpose: the present study was performed to clarify the relationship between periodontal disease severity and selected immunological parameters consisting of  serum igg titer against periodontopathogenic bacteria, the expression of the helper t-cell cytokine by gingival mononuclear cells, and patients' immunoreactivity to cross-reactive heat shock protein (hsp) epitope peptide from  p. gingivalis hsp60. methods: twenty-five patients with moderate periodontitis had their gingival connective tissue harvested of gingival mononuclear cells during an open flap debridement procedure and peripheral blood was drawn by venipuncture to collect serum. the mean level of interproximal alveolar bone was  calculated to be used as an index for periodontal disease severity for a given patient. each of selected immunologic parameters was subject to statistical management to seek their correlations with the severity of periodontal disease. results: a significant correlation could not be identified between serum igg titers against specific bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and streptococcus mutans) and the severity of periodontal disease. expression of interleukin (il)-10 by gingival mononuclear cells was statistically significant in the group of patients who had higher levels of alveolar bone height. however,  a similar correlation could not be demonstrated in cases for il-4 or interferon-gamma. patients' serum reactivity to cross-reactive epitope peptide showed a significant correlation with the amount of alveolar bone. conclusions: it was concluded that expression of il-10 by gingival mononuclear cells and patients' sero-reactivity to the cross-reactive hsp peptide of p. gingivalis hsp60 were significantly correlated with alveolar bone height.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == communication: antimicrobial activity of smap28 with a targeting domain for porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == antibiotic therapy is often used with mechanical therapy to treat periodontal disease. however, complications associated with antibiotic use can occur. a 'bacteria-specific' targeted approach would eliminate some of these complications and kill specific periodontopathogens without harming the commensal bacteria. one such approach is to couple antimicrobial peptides to a ligand, pheromone, or antibody specific for the periodontopathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. to assess the feasibility of this approach, we attached pqgppq, a peptide from proline-rich protein 1 to either the n-terminus of smap28 (peptide zs37-37) or the c-terminus  of smap28 (peptide zs37-38) to see whether it has potential as a carrier ligand to deliver smap28 to the surface of p. gingivalis. for escherichia coli and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, the median minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of zs37-37 was higher than the median of smap28 alone, although the median mic of zs37-38 was lower than that of smap28 alone. for p. gingivalis, there was no difference in the median mic values. for s. aureus, the  median mic was higher for zs37-37 and zs37-38 compared to smap28 alone, particularly for zs37-38. for fusobacterium nucleatum, the median mic values were equal for zs37-37 and zs37-38 and higher than the median mic for smap28 alone. attaching pqgppq to smap28 did not greatly increase the antimicrobial activity of zs37-37 or zs37-38 for p. gingivalis nor substantially decrease the antimicrobial activity of zs37-37 or zs37-38 for the four other microorganisms tested. this is  an initial step to develop a selective antimicrobial agent that has 'targeted' antimicrobial activity without adverse reactions often associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

TI  == innate inflammatory responses of human decidual cells to periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontopathic bacteria exert potent proinflammatory effects in human decidua.  study design: the immunostimulatory effects of gram-positive and negative periodontopathic bacteria and their lipopolysaccharides were tested in human decidual cell cultures in comparison with escherichia coli. cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; inflammatory gene expression was measured by oligonucleotide arrays and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. results: all bacteria that were tested elicited an inflammatory response, although concentration-dependence and efficacy varied considerably with organism and culture. lipopolysaccharides were more potent stimuli than intact bacterial cells, although bacteria exerted greater effects at high concentrations. of 112 genes on the arrays, 18 genes were stimulated significantly by one or more lipopolysaccharide preparation. conclusion: the ability of periodontopathic bacteria to stimulate a decidual inflammatory response is highly variable and partly dependent on the presence and structure of constituent lipopolysaccharides. this adds to our understanding of the causal association between periodontal disease and preterm birth.

TI  == [effect of periodontal mechanical treatment on periodontal pathogenic bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid of chronic periodontitis patients].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the subgingival prevalent rates of 6 periodontal pathogenic bacteria in gingival crevicular fluids of cp patients before and after treatment, to analyze the relationship between the prevalent variance and periodontal clinical parameters, and to provide a microbiologic method of evaluating curative effect and estimating the prognosis. methods: gingival crevicular fluids of 13 cp patients were collected at baseline, 2 weeks, 2 months and 4 months after periodontal mechanical treatment. also, gingival crevicular fluids were collected from 11 healthy subjects. six periodontal pathogenic bacteria including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis(pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum(fn), prevotella nigrescens (pn) were detected by 16s rrna based pcr. results: the pli, pd, bi of the cp patients 2 months and 4 months after periodontal mechanical treatment were evidently less than those before treatment. these 4 months after treatment were a little more than those 2 months  after. the six bacteria were more frequently detected in the cp patients at baseline than in healthy controls. the prevalent rates of tf (42.1%, 73.7%, 70.2%), pg (47.4%, 68.4%, 77.2%), aa (15.8%, 22.8%, 7.0%), pn (38.6%, 57.9%, 64.9%), pi(15.8%, 38.6%, 42.1%) 2 weeks, 2 months and 4 months following treatment were significantly lower than those at baseline (tf 96.5%, pg 93.0%, aa 36.8%, pn 86.0%, pi 84.2%), but the prevalent rates of all the detected bacteria  2 months after treatment were higher than those at 2 weeks after. conclusion: tf, pg, aa, pn and pi may cooperate in the development of cp. the changes of periodontal pathogenic bacteria could be detected before the changes of clinical  parameters and the patients should be re-evaluated and re-treated regularly within 2 months after treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of super-oxidised water against oral microorganisms.
AB  == objective: the radical anion of oxygen (o(-)) is extremely oxidative and shows high reactivity. in this study, the antibacterial activity of water super-oxidised water containing high concentration of o(-) (o(-)-water) was tested against cultured planktonic cells of cariogenic bacteria, periodontopathic bacteria and candida albicans. methods: o(-)-water was prepared using the aoe-750 (oxy japan corporation, japan) and its antibacterial activity against pure culture of streptococcus sobrinus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and c. albicans evaluated. each oral microorganism (10(4) to 10(8)cfu/ml) was exposed to three concentrations of o(-)-water at room temperature or 37 degrees c for 15s to 24h. results: exposure to o(-)-water resulted in a bactericidal effect against all cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria tested. no significant fungicidal effect was observed on c. albicans, however. conclusion: the results demonstrate  that o(-)-water exerts an antibacterial effect on cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == mixture of periodontopathogenic bacteria influences interaction with kb cells.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to investigate the adhesion and invasion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in varied mixed infections and the release of interleukins from an epithelial cell line (kb cells). methods: kb cells were co-cultured with porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and m5-1-2, tannerella forsythia atcc 43037, treponema denticola atcc 35405 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586 in single and mixed infections. the numbers of adherent and  internalized bacteria were determined up to 18 h after bacterial exposure. additionally, the mrna expression and concentrations of released interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 were measured. results: all periodontopathogenic bacteria adhered and internalized in different numbers to kb cells, but individually without any evidence of co-aggregation also to f. nucleatum. high levels of epithelial mrna of il-6 and il-8 were detectable after all bacterial challenges. after the mixed  infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 the highest levels of released interleukins were found. no il-6 and il-8 were detectable after the mixed infection of p. gingivalis m5-1-2 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 and the fourfold infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277, t. denticola atcc 35405, t. forsythia atcc 43037 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586. conclusion: anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria promote the release of il-6 and il-8 by epithelial  cells. despite a continuous epithelial expression of il-8 mrna by all bacterial infections these effects are temporary because of the time-dependent degradation  of cytokines by bacterial proteases. mixed infections have a stronger virulence potential than single bacteria. further research is necessary to evaluate the role of mixed infections and biofilms in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == full-mouth antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in fusobacterium nucleatum-infected periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to clinically and microbiologically evaluate the effect of photodynamic therapy (pdt) as a full-mouth procedure in fusobacterium nucleatum-infected patients with periodontitis. methods: in the present study, pdt is administered adjuvantly after scaling and root planing (srp) to patients with localized chronic periodontitis (lcp). twenty-four patients, in whom only f. nucleatum was detected by baseline polymerase chain reaction (pcr) after srp, were randomly assigned to pdt and control groups. pdt was carried out once as a full-mouth disinfection in the test group. the control  group was treated with the photosensitizer solution, but without laser irradiation. in all subjects, the clinical parameters plaque index, reddening, bleeding on probing (bop), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were determined at the baseline examination and at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after pdt. quantitative analysis of the f. nucleatum dna concentration was performed by competitive pcr. all clinical indices were calculated for each test and control subject as were the median and interquartile range of each group. results: in patients with lcp who received pdt treatment, significant reductions in reddening, bop, and mean pd and cal were observed during the observation period and with respect to controls. four and 12 weeks after pdt, the mean pd and cal showed significant differences from baseline values and from those of the control group. in the pdt group, 12 weeks after treatment, the f. nucleatum dna concentration was found to be significantly reduced compared to the baseline level. conclusion: the results of this study show that the adjuvant application of the described pdt method is appropriate to  reduce periodontal inflammatory symptoms and to successfully treat infection with f. nucleatum.

TI  == supernatants from oral epithelial cells and gingival fibroblasts modulate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter activation induced by periodontopathogens  in monocytes/macrophages.
AB  == bacterial and host cell products during coinfections of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-positive (hiv-1(+)) patients regulate hiv-1 recrudescence in latently infected cells (e.g. t cells, monocytes/macrophages), impacting highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) failure and progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. a high frequency of oral opportunistic infections (e.g. periodontitis) in hiv-1(+) patients has been demonstrated; however, their potential to impact hiv-1 exacerbation is unclear. we sought to determine the ability of supernatants derived from oral epithelial cells (okf4) and human gingival fibroblasts (gin-4) challenged with periodontal pathogens, to modulate the hiv-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages. bf24 monocytes/macrophages transfected with the hiv-1 promoter driving the expression  of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) were stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, or treponema denticola in the presence of supernatants from okf4 or gin4 cells either unstimulated or previously pulsed with bacteria. cat levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cytokine production was evaluated by luminex beadlyte assays. okf4 and gin4 supernatants enhanced hiv-1 promoter activation particularly related to f. nucleatum challenge. an additive effect was observed in hiv-1 promoter activation when monocytes/macrophages were simultaneously stimulated with gingival cell supernatants and bacterial extracts. okf4 cells produced higher levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) and interleukins -6 and -8 in response to f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. preincubation of okf4 supernatants with anti-gm-csf reduced the additive effect in periodontopathogen-induced hiv-1 promoter activation. these results suggest that  soluble mediators produced by gingival resident cells in response to periodontopathogens could contribute to hiv-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages, albeit this effect is most notable following direct stimulation of the cells with oral gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == a novel bioactivity of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and their ester derivatives.
AB  == fish oil, enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufa), is widely used as a dietary or nutritional supplement with numerous benefits, including as  an anti-inflammatory particularly linked to atherosclerosis. while n-3 pufa have  been suggested to be able to improve oral health through a reduction in inflammation through elevations in these fatty acids in serum and cellular membranes, information is lacking for the possibility that these fatty acids could directly impact the survival and growth of the oral bacteria that trigger the chronic inflammatory responses. the n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and alpha-linolenic acid (ala), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, alaee, epaee, dhaee were analysed for antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. this study demonstrated a novel bioactivity of the three  major n-3 pufa, epa, dha, and ala, and their ester derivatives. our experimental  data indicated that n-3 pufa and their ester derivatives exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. this study suggested that n-3 pufa could have a positive therapeutic effect for improving oral health via their antibacterial activities, besides their anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  == potentiation of bacterial killing activity of zinc chloride by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate.
AB  == zinc has antimicrobial activity and zinc salts including zinc chloride (zncl(2))  have been used for the control of oral malodor. in this study, we hypothesized that pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (pdtc), a zinc ionophore, may enhance antimicrobial efficacy of zncl(2). the bactericidal effectiveness of zncl(2) alone (0.5-8 mm) or in combination with pdtc (1 or 10 microm) was evaluated by in vitro short (1 h) time-killing assays against fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. only a slight viability decrease was observed with zncl(2) or pdtc alone after 1-h incubation. by contrast, combination of zncl(2) and pdtc could achieve a more than 100-fold viability reduction compared with zncl(2) or pdtc alone in f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. therefore, pdtc greatly  enhanced the bactericidal activity of zncl(2) against the oral malodor-producing  bacteria. these results suggest that use of pdtc may be useful for enhancing bactericidal activity of antimalodor regimens of zinc salts.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == interplay of protease-activated receptors and nod pattern recognition receptors in epithelial innate immune responses to bacteria.
AB  == protease-activated receptors (pars), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod) receptors and toll-like receptors (tlrs) play a role in innate immunity, but little is known about interaction between these receptors. the goal of this study was to investigate how silencing one receptor affects the expression of other receptors and downstream innate immune markers in response to bacteria. human gingival epithelial cells (gecs) were transfected with sirna specific for par1 or par2, then stimulated with periopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis, bridging organism between pathogens and non-pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum, or non-pathogen streptococcus gordonii. par1 or par2 knock-down resulted in up-regulated nod1 and nod2 expression with p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum stimulation (p<0.01), as well as enhanced tlr2 and tlr4 expression when cells were stimulated by bacteria that utilize tlr2 or tlr4, respectively. involvement  of pars for induction of cc chemokine ligand 20 (ccl20), a cytokine with antimicrobial properties, was observed following stimulation of the three bacterial species. furthermore, results from multiple cytokine elisa array showed receptors utilized in the induction of various innate immune markers are tailored to individual bacterium tested. our data suggest complex interplay of several receptors is required for appropriate innate immune responses to the different types of bacteria present within the oral cavity and that receptor expression itself is altered depending on which organism the cell encounters.

TI  == quantification of five putative periodontal pathogens in female patients with and without chronic periodontitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is a highly prevalent endogenous polymicrobial disease. to  better understand the etiology of the disease a quantitative approach is mandatory and real-time pcr is the molecular technique currently preferred to achieve this purpose. taking into account that such a kind of study is still scarce, we aimed to evaluate the association between periodontal microbiota and chronic periodontitis. a total of 60 low-income age-matched female adults, 30 with chronic periodontitis and 30 without periodontal disease, were enrolled. dna obtained from subgingival specimens was used for quantification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia by real-time pcr.  a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum were detected in all subjects, p. gingivalis was observed in 70.0% and 46.6% and p. intermedia in 90.0% and 80.0% of chronic periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy subjects, respectively. p. gingivalis mean count was significantly higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in periodontally healthy individuals. accurate detection and quantification of five putative periodontal pathogens was  feasible using a simple and fast real-time pcr protocol. although p. gingivalis and p. intermedia have been found more commonly in chronic periodontitis patients, no statistical difference was observed between periodontally diseased and healthy groups. quantitative data indicated association between p. gingivalis and chronic periodontitis. however, because of its uneven distribution, it should not be solely taken as a marker of periodontal status.

TI  == vaccination targeting surface foma of fusobacterium nucleatum against bacterial co-aggregation: implication for treatment of periodontal infection and halitosis.
AB  == the mechanical therapy with multiple doses of antibiotics is one of modalities for treatment of periodontal diseases. however, treatments using multiple doses of antibiotics carry risks of generating resistant strains and misbalancing the resident body flora. we present an approach via immunization targeting an outer membrane protein foma of fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum), a central bridging organism in the architecture of oral biofilms. neutralization of foma considerably abrogated the enhancement of bacterial co-aggregation, biofilms and  production of volatile sulfur compounds mediated by an inter-species interaction  of f. nucleatum with porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). vaccination targeting foma also conferred a protective effect against co-infection-induced gum inflammation. here, we advance a novel infectious mechanism by which f. nucleatum co-opts p. gingivalis to exacerbate gum infections. foma is highlighted as a potential target for development of new therapeutics against periodontal infection and halitosis in humans.

AB  == to determine the influence of oral status on halitosis, the relationship between  halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria present in plaque on the tongue and the subgingival sulcus was examined in 62 periodontally healthy adults. halitosis indicators used were the organoleptic score; gas chromatography results [total volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) = h(2)s + ch(3)sh + (ch(3))(2)s]; halimeter values; and the results of three clinical tests, plaque control record (plcr), plaque index (pli), and tongue coat status. significant correlations with organoleptic scores was observed for plcr, pli, tongue coat status, vsc amounts,  and halimeter values, indicating that halitosis in periodontally healthy subjects tended to originate from tongue plaque deposits. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect six periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola) from the tongue and subgingival plaque. significant effects on the organoleptic scores, tongue coat status, total vsc, h(2)s and ch(3)sh amounts, and halimeter values were observed only for t. denticola and f. nucleatum and only in the tongue plaque, not in the subgingival plaque. thus, therapies developed to inhibit the growth of these bacteria may lead to future treatments of halitosis.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

TI  == epithelial cell pro-inflammatory cytokine response differs across dental plaque bacterial species.
AB  == aim: the dental plaque is comprised of numerous bacterial species, which may or may not be pathogenic. human gingival epithelial cells (hgecs) respond to perturbation by various bacteria of the dental plaque by production of different  levels of inflammatory cytokines, which is a putative reflection of their virulence. the aim of the current study was to determine responses in terms of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 secretion induced by porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus gordonii in order to gauge their virulence potential. materials and methods: hgecs were challenged with the four bacterial species, live or heat killed, at various multiplicity of infections and the elicited il-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 responses were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: primary hgecs challenged with live p. gingivalis produced high levels of il-1beta, while challenge with live a. actinomycetemcomitans gave high levels of  il-8. the opportunistic pathogen f. nucleatum induces the highest levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the commensal s. gordonii is the least stimulatory. conclusion: we conclude that various dental plaque biofilm bacteria  induce different cytokine response profiles in primary hgecs that may reflect their individual virulence or commensal status.

AB  == background: it has been suggested that use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to patients with specific microbiologic profiles. the main purpose of the present analysis was to study whether microbiologic testing before therapy was of value in predicting which patients would specifically benefit from adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole, given in the context of full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp) within 48 hours. methods: this was a 6-month, single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized longitudinal study. fifty-one patients received full-mouth periodontal debridement, performed within 48 hours;  then, 25 subjects received metronidazole, 500 mg, and amoxicillin, 375 mg, three  times a day for 7 days, and 26 received a placebo (control group). pooled microbiologic samples were taken from the deepest pocket at baseline in each quadrant before and 6 months after treatment. six periodontal pathogens were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: forty-seven patients  were followed for 6 months. after treatment, test subjects had a substantially lower mean number of persisting sites with probing depth >4 mm and bleeding on probing than did control subjects (0.4 versus 3.0; p = 0.005; month 6). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) could not be detected in the antibiotic group after treatment. however, in the placebo group, three of six subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans continued to be positive. lower frequencies were also noted in the test group for porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.013) and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.007). however, even subjects testing negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline had a significantly better primary clinical outcome if they received the active drugs. the presence of six putative periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum spp., p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and t. forsythia) quantified prior to therapy was not correlated with the outcome of full-mouth srp with or without amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: excellent clinical results in the antibiotics group were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of six classic periodontal periopathogens prior to treatment.

TI  == differential effects of periopathogens on host protease inhibitors slpi, elafin,  scca1, and scca2.
AB  == objective: secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitors (slpi), elafin, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 and 2 (scca1 and scca2) are specific endogenous serine protease inhibitors expressed by epithelial cells that prevent tissue damage from excessive proteolytic enzyme activity due to inflammation. to determine the effects of various periopathogens on these protease inhibitors, we utilized human gingival epithelial cells (gecs) challenged with cell-free bacteria supernatants  of various periopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. design: the gene expression and secretion of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were determined using real-time pcr and elisa, respectively. the direct effects of periopathogens and p. gingivalis gingipain mutants on these inhibitors were examined in vitro by western blot. the effect on the innate immune response of gecs was measured by expression of antimicrobial peptides: human beta-defenisin-2 (hbd2) and chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 20 (ccl20). results: we found that slpi, scca2, elafin, hbd2,  and ccl20 gene expression levels were significantly induced (p<0.001) in response to p. gingivalis, whose virulence factors include cysteine proteases, but not in  response to stimulation by other bacteria. p. gingivalis reduced the secretion of slpi and elafin significantly in gecs, and degraded recombinant slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2. differential degradation patterns of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were observed with different bacteria as well as p. gingivalis mutants associated with the loss of specific gingipains secreted by p. gingivalis. in addition, pretreatment of gecs with slpi, scca1, or scca2 partially blocked hbd2  and ccl20 mrna expression in response to p. gingivalis, suggesting a protective effect. conclusion: our results suggest that different periopathogens affect the  host protease inhibitors in a different manner, suggesting host susceptibility may differ in the presence of these pathogens. the balance between cellular protease inhibitors and their degradation may be an important factor in susceptibility to periodontal infection.

TI  == nod1 and nod2 mediate sensing of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == in bacterial infection, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod) 1 and nod2 induce innate immune responses by recognizing fragments of the bacterial component peptidoglycan (pgn). to determine the roles of these receptors in detection of periodontal pathogens, we stimulated human embryonic kidney cells expressing nod1 or nod2 with heat-killed porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum or their soluble pgns (spgns). all bacteria and their spgns could stimulate activation of  nf-kappab. however, there were differences in nod1- and nod2-stimulatory activities among the species of bacteria. p. gingivalis showed weaker nod1- and nod2-stimulatory activities than did other bacteria. these differences in activities were confirmed by production of interleukin-8 from oral epithelial cells stimulated with spgns. these findings indicate that both nod1 and nod2 might be involved in the recognition of periodontal pathogens, and that the weak  nod-stimulatory property of p. gingivalis might be helpful for survival in the periodontal pocket.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == sonic extracts from a bacterium related to periapical disease activate gelatinase a and inactivate tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases timp-1 and timp-2.
AB  == aim: to examine the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (sbes) from three related to periapical disease bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum) on the activation of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-2) and the inactivation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (timp-1 and timp-2). methodology: each sbe was added to cultures of human periodontal ligament (pl) cells or ht1080 cells and their supernatants were analysed by zymography for mmp-2. each sbe was added to pl cell cultures, and the amount of timp-1 was determined by elisa. p. gingivalis sbe was incubated with ht1080 cell culture supernatants, and the amounts of timp-1 and timp-2 were determined by elisa. statistical analysis was performed with the paired student's t-test. results: in  extracts of pl cells that had been incubated in the presence of p. gingivalis sbe, one representing pro-mmp-2 (72 kda) and a band corresponding to the active mmp-2 (66 kda) were observed; but in the other extracts it was not detected. when ht1080 cells were treated with p. gingivalis sbe, the pro-mmps was processed into 86- and 66-kda fragments, but in the other extracts, the processing did not occur when the other sbes were used. when pl cells were incubated with the same sbes, the amount of timp-1 was markedly decreased (p < 0.01), but in the other extracts, it was not. the amounts of both timp-1 and timp-2 were decreased in a dose-dependent manner when ht1080 cell culture supernatant was incubated with p.  gingivalis sbe. conclusions: these findings suggest that p. gingivalis sbe may cause connective tissue to be destroyed, contributing to the process of periapical disease, by activating pro-mmp-2 as well as by inactivating timp-1 and timp-2.

TI  == hydrogen sulfide production from cysteine and homocysteine by periodontal and oral bacteria.
AB  == background: hydrogen sulfide is one of the predominant volatile sulfur compounds  (vscs) produced by oral bacteria. this study developed and evaluated a system for detecting hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria. methods: l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (metase) and beta carbon-sulfur (beta c-s) lyase were used to degrade homocysteine and cysteine, respectively, to produce hydrogen sulfide. enzymatic reactions resulting in hydrogen sulfide production were assayed by reaction with bismuth trichloride, which forms a black precipitate when mixed with hydrogen sulfide. the enzymatic activities of various oral bacteria that result in hydrogen sulfide production and the capacity of bacteria from periodontal sites to form hydrogen sulfide in reaction mixtures containing l-cysteine or dl-homocysteine were assayed. results: with l-cysteine as the substrate, streptococcus anginosus fw73 produced the most  hydrogen sulfide, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis american type culture collection (atcc) 33277 and w83 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 produced approximately 35% of the amount produced by the p. gingivalis strains. finally, the hydrogen sulfide found in subgingival plaque was analyzed. using bismuth trichloride, the hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria was visually detectable as a black precipitate. conclusions: hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria was easily analyzed using bismuth trichloride. however, further innovation is required for practical use.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of periodontal pathogens obtained from frequent antibiotic  users.
AB  == the occurrence of bacterial strains resistant to different antimicrobials is a growing problem in latin american countries. the aim was to measure the antimicrobial susceptibility of fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and prophyromona gingivalis, isolated from chronic periodontitis patients. twenty-five patients diagnosed with generalized- moderate or advanced- chronic periodontitis were consecutively recruited from patients attending the periodontal specialist program, javeriana university, according to specific criteria, including no recent antibiotic consumption. all patients filled out a questionnaire on antibiotic intake. the deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant was sampled. pooled samples were mixed, diluted and plated on enriched brucella agar plates. after anaerobic incubation, identification of the target bacteria was performed, based on colony morphology, gram staining, aerotolerance  and biochemical reactions (rapid ana ii, remel, u.s.a.). following identification, the bacteria were subjected to antimicrobial testing, using amoxicillin, tetracycline, doxycicline, azithromycin and metronidazole (e-test, abbiodisk, sweden). the minimal inhibitory concentrations obtained were compared  with a reference standard to determine antimicrobial resistance. amoxicillin-resistant species were tested for beta-lactamase production. forty-four percent of the patients used antibiotics without any medical prescription, 40% used antibiotics at least once a year. the presence of eleven species was confirmed after a series of biochemical tests: four fusobacterium nucleatum, five prevotella intermedia and two prophyromona gingivalis. all strains were resistant to metronidazole, five were resistant to tetracycline and  azithromicin, and two strains were resistant to doxycicline and amoxicillin. the  strains resistant to amoxicillin were positive for beta-lactamase production, antimicrobial resistance, particularly against metronidazole, was a common phenomenon for the bacterial isolates analyzed in this colombian sample.

TI  == progression of chronic periodontitis can be predicted by the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque.
AB  == introduction: chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting  tissues of the teeth associated with bacteria. diagnosis is achieved retrospectively by clinical observation of attachment loss. predicting disease progression would allow for targeted preventive therapy. the aim of this study was to monitor disease progression in patients on a maintenance program and determine the levels of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque samples and then  examine the ability of the clinical parameters of disease and levels of specific  bacteria in the plaque samples to predict disease progression. methods: during a  12-month longitudinal study of 41 subjects, 25 sites in 21 subjects experienced disease progression indicated by at least 2 mm of clinical attachment loss. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. results: no clinical parameters were able to predict periodontal disease progression. in sites undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression within  the next 3 months, significant partial correlations were found between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and t. denticola and t. forsythia (r = 0.43, p = 0.04). the odds of a site undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression increased with increasing levels of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusion: monitoring the proportions of p. gingivalis and t.  denticola in subgingival plaque has the potential to help identify sites at significant risk for progression of periodontitis, which would assist in the targeted treatment of disease.

TI  == photodynamic therapy of persistent pockets in maintenance patients-a clinical study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the short-term performance of a session of single photodynamic therapy (pdt) and of a conventional ultrasonic debridement (ust) in persistent pockets of maintenance patients. in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical study, patients with chronic periodontitis with at least two persistent pockets (>4 mm) were enrolled. they were treated either with ust (n = 29) or pdt (n = 25). clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline and after 3 months. for ust, the mean probing depth was reduced from 5.3 to 4.5 mm (p = <0.001) and for pdt from 5.3 to 4.7 mm (p < 0.001) with no difference between the two treatment modalities. microbial counts were significantly reduced about 30% to 40% immediately after debridement but returned to baseline values a 3 months irrespective of treatment. pdt is not superior to conventional mechanical treatment of persistent pockets, but it may be a meaningful therapeutic alternative; the clinical effects were too minor to draw a definitive conclusion.

TI  == differential ability of periodontopathic bacteria to modulate invasion of human gingival epithelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontitis is a polymicrobial infection caused by selected gram-negative bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis. host cell invasion by p. gingivalis  has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of periodontopathogens on p. gingivalis invasion of gingival epithelial cells in polymicrobial infection. p. gingivalis was tested for its ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell  line ca9-22 in co-infection with periodontopathogens, using an antibiotic protection assay. among the pathogens tested, only fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrated the ability to significantly promote p. gingivalis invasion (p<0.01). this increased invasion was confirmed by confocal scanning laser microscopy utilizing a dual labeling technique. in contrast, co-infection with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or tannerella forsythia attenuated p. gingivalis invasion. the fusobacterial enhancement of host cell invasion was not  observed in co-incubation with other periodontopathogens tested. these results suggested that complex synergistic or antagonistic physiologic mechanisms are intimately involved in host cell invasion by p. gingivalis in polymicrobial infection.

TI  == an unusual autopsy case of pyogenic liver abscess caused by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == pyogenic liver abscess (pla) formation is thought to originate from the transmission of infection via three major routes including the biliary tract, portal vein and hepatic artery. however, about 50% of pla cases are considered to be cryptogenic. here we report an unusual autopsy case of pla associated with periodontopathic bacterial infection. a 59-year-old female suddenly developed cardiopulmonary arrest and died. despite macroscopic and microscopic examinations, the infectious routes and source of infection were unidentified, and the case appeared to be cryptogenic. since this patient had suffered severe periodontitis for a long period of time, we investigated the involvement of periodontal infection in pla formation by performing immunohistochemical analyses. we identified several periodontopathic bacterial species in the pla of  this patient, including fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis. thus, we demonstrate here that periodontal infection is a potential source of infection in the formation of pla.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

TI  == contemporary root canal irrigants are able to disrupt and eradicate single- and dual-species biofilms.
AB  == introduction: clinical/microbiological studies have consistently revealed the persistence of some bacteria after conventional root canal debridement. although  this was originally attributed to the complexity of the root canal anatomy and the difficulty of delivering antibacterial agents effectively, it has emerged that the biofilm encasement of bacterial cells may confer a further mechanism of  resistance. the purpose of this study was to investigate the relative disruption  and bactericidal effects of root canal irrigants on single- and dual-species biofilms of root canal isolates. methods: biofilms of streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were grown on nitrocellulose membranes for 72 hours and immersed in naocl, edta, chlorhexidine, and iodine for 1, 5, or 10 minutes. the number of viable and nonviable bacteria disrupted from the biofilm and those remaining adherent were determined by using a viability stain in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy. results: gram-negative obligate anaerobe species were more susceptible to cell removal than gram-positive facultative anaerobes. the majority of cells were disrupted after the first minute of exposure; however, the extent varied according to the agent and species. the most effective agent at disrupting biofilms was naocl. iodine was generally effective at bacterial killing but not disruption. conclusions: biofilm disruption and cell viability were influenced by the species, their coassociation in dual-species biofilms, the test agent, and the duration of exposure. the effectiveness of naocl as an endodontic irrigant was reinforced.

TI  == the effect of lactoferrin on oral bacterial attachment.
AB  == introduction: lactoferrin (lf), an iron-binding salivary glycoprotein, plays an important role in human innate defense against local mucosal infection. we hypothesized that lf interferes with initial oral bacterial attachment to surfaces by iron sequestration, so inhibiting subsequent biofilm formation. the objective was to investigate the effect of lf on the early stages of single-species and multi-species oral biofilm development. methods: streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis were used in this study. glass disks of a two-track flow cell coated with flowing artificial saliva (0.3 ml/min) with and without lf (100 microg/ml) were used for studying bacterial attachment (3 h, 37 degrees c). attachment was also examined by incubating single or multiple species of test bacteria (10(7) colony-forming units/ml) with lf-coated (20-100 microg/ml) and uncoated glass slides. the effects of beta-lactoglobulin, 2,2'-dipyridyl (25-100 microg/ml), an  iron chelator, and fecl3 on attachment were also examined. results: lf inhibited  the initial attachment of s. gordonii (50.3%, p < 0.05) but not that of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. however, the attachment of a dual-species biofilm containing s. gordonii (i.e. s. gordonii/f. nucleatum or s. gordonii/p. gingivalis) was significantly reduced (48.7% or 62.1%, respectively, p < 0.05) in the presence of lf. beta-lactoglobulin did not affect the attachment of s. gordonii. in the presence of 100 microm 2,2'-dipyridyl, attachment of s. gordonii was reduced by 53.87%. no reduction in attachment was noted in s. gordonii pretreated with lf (100 microg/ml) and fecl3 (20-200 microm). conclusion: lf suppresses initial attachment of s. gordonii and s. gordonii coaggregates by iron sequestration. this may lead to subsequent inhibition of oral biofilm development.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

AB  == the present study compared the recovery of six periodontal pathogens by paper point samples from two different aspects of periodontal lesions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty patients with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. before subgingival instrumentation and after 10 weeks samples in group a were taken first with a paper point half length (hp) of the probing depth, then with a paper point full length (fp) at the same site. in group b sampling sequence was reversed. analysis by real-time pcr enabled quantification of six bacteria as well as total bacterial count (tbc). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman's correlations. higher  tbc could be harvested by use of fp than by hp (mean of differences of ln-transformed counts before therapy: -0.791, ci [-1.515, -0.068], sd 0.770, p =  0.034; after therapy: -0.563, ci [-1.151, 0.024], sd 0.625, p = 0.059). the plaque composition regarding total target pathogens was similar for both samples. both, for tbc as well as for single target bacteria a strong positive correlation was found between hp and fp (kappa, spearman correlation: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0.807, 0.778; fusobacterium nucleatum 0.573, 0.772; porphyromonas gingivalis 0.733, 0.824; prevotella intermedia 0.480, 0.756; treponema denticola 0.807, 0.814; and tannerella forsythia 0.692, 0.695). the recovery of target pathogens was similar following sampling at various depths of  the periodontal lesion.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

TI  == proteomic analysis of endodontic infections by liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry.
AB  == introduction: endodontic infections are very prevalent and have a polymicrobial etiology characterized by complex interrelationships between endodontic microorganisms and the host defenses. proteomic analysis of endodontic infections can provide global insights into the invasion, pathogenicity mechanisms, and multifactorial interactions existing between root canal bacteria and the host in  the initiation and progression of apical periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to apply proteomic techniques such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) for the identification of proteins of bacterial origin present in endodontic infections. methods: endodontic specimens were aseptically  obtained from seven patients with root canal infections. protein mixtures were subjected to tryptic in-solution digestion and analysed by reverse-phase nano-lc-ms/ms followed by a database search. results: proteins, mainly of cell wall or membrane origin, from endodontic bacteria especially enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola were identified from all the samples tested. identified proteins included adhesins, autolysins, proteases, virulence factors,  and antibiotic-resistance proteins. conclusions: lc-ms/ms offers a sensitive analytical platform to study the disease processes in the root canal environment. the array of proteins expressed in endodontic infections reflects the complex microbial presence and highlights the bacterial species involved in the inflammatory process.

AB  == aim: to compare polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-ident test) and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and  3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: three hundred and fifty samples  were evaluated using both techniques. regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the pcr-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. the highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum and eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. conclusion: detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.

TI  == [detection of luxs gene of quorum sensing signal system in periodontal pathogen].
AB  == objective: to detect the presence and distribution of luxs gene in quorum sensing signal system in the periodontal pathogens. methods: the total dna of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), actinobacillus acitinomycetimcomtans (aa) were extracted. the presence of luxs was detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the products of pcr were detected by electrophoresis, sequenced and identified by a blast search of the genbank database. results: electrophoresis, sequencing and blast searching indicated that the pcr products of pg were highly consistent with the luxs gene in genbank. the  sequencing result of fn was also identified with the target gene. the pcr product of aa was the same as reference through electrophoresis. conclusions: pg, fn, aa  contain luxs gene. further studies may be required to investigate the functions of luxs in the periodontal pathogens.

TI  == systemic immune responses in pregnancy and periodontitis: relationship to pregnancy outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study.
AB  == background: our previous studies reported on the obstetric, periodontal, and microbiologic outcomes of women participating in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study. this article describes the systemic antibody responses to selected periodontal bacteria in the same patients. methods: serum samples, obtained from pregnant women at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation) and 29 to 32 weeks, were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, women who delivered live preterm infants had significantly  lower total serum levels of igg antibody to the panel of periodontal pathogens (p = 0.0018), to p. gingivalis (p = 0.0013), and to f. nucleatum (p = 0.0200) than women who delivered at term. these differences were not significant at 29 to 32 weeks. changes in igg levels between baseline and 29 to 32 weeks were not associated with preterm birth when adjusted for treatment group, clinical center, race, or age. in addition, delivery of low birth weight infants was not associated with levels of antibody at baseline or with antibody changes during pregnancy. conclusions: live preterm birth is associated with decreased levels of igg antibody to periodontal pathogens in women with periodontitis when assessed during the second trimester. changes in igg antibody during pregnancy are not associated with birth outcomes.

TI  == methods for optimizing dna extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time pcr.
AB  == methods for the optimal extraction of genomic dna for real-time pcr enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica and fusobacterium nucleatum. traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of dna content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time pcr approach. evidence was obtained that p. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded dna from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. this nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mm diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol  at 4 degrees c overnight. a final purification of the dna to remove any potential pcr inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of dna by real-time pcr and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.

TI  == proteomics of porphyromonas gingivalis within a model oral microbial community.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis is a periodontal pathogen that resides in a  complex multispecies microbial biofilm community known as dental plaque. confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that p. gingivalis can assemble into communities in vitro with streptococcus gordonii and fusobacterium nucleatum, common constituents of dental plaque. whole cell quantitative proteomics, along with mutant construction and analysis, were conducted to investigate how p. gingivalis adapts to this three species community. results: 1156 p. gingivalis proteins were detected qualitatively during comparison of the three species model community with p. gingivalis incubated alone under the same conditions. integration of spectral counting and summed signal intensity analyses of the dataset showed that 403 proteins were down-regulated and 89 proteins up-regulated. the proteomics results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david. significant decreases were seen in proteins involved in cell shape and the formation of the cell envelope, as well as thiamine, cobalamin, and pyrimidine synthesis and dna repair. an overall increase was seen in proteins involved in protein synthesis. hmur, a tonb dependent outer membrane receptor, was up-regulated in the community and an hmur deficient mutant was deficient in three species community formation, but was unimpaired in its ability to form mono- or dual-species biofilms. conclusion: collectively, these results indicate that p. gingivalis can assemble into a heterotypic community with f. nucleatum and s. gordonii, and that a community lifestyle provides physiologic support for p. gingivalis. proteins such as hmur, that are up-regulated, can be necessary for community structure.

TI  == mouse model of experimental periodontitis induced by porphyromonas gingivalis/fusobacterium nucleatum infection: bone loss and host response.
AB  == aim: to compare the effect of oral infection with porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum versus infection with both bacteria on mouse periodontal  tissues, and to characterize the inflammatory response. materials and methods: mice were orally infected with p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum or both. at 42 days post-infection, alveolar bone loss was quantified using micro-computerized tomography. tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin (il)-1beta levels induced by the infection were quantified using the subcutaneous chamber model. results: mice orally infected with f. nucleatum/p. gingivalis exhibited significantly more bone loss compared with that of mono-infected and sham-infected mice. f. nucleatum/p. gingivalis infection also increased the levels of tnf-alpha and il1beta compared with the levels found in the mono-infected groups. conclusions: polymicrobial infection with p. gingivalis/f.  nucleatum aggravates alveolar bone loss and induces a stronger inflammatory response compared with that observed upon infection with either bacterium alone.  the results suggest that oral infection of mice with a mixture of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum may be superior to mono-infection models of experimental periodontitis.

TI  == human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus inhibit oral bacteria-induced macrophage activation and phagocytosis.
AB  == introduction: periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition caused by periodontal microorganisms. viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) and epstein-barr virus (ebv) are associated with certain types of periodontal disease, but their roles in promoting the disease are unclear. because both viruses infect human macrophages, cells which play key roles in the clearance of  pathogenic bacteria, it is likely that the viruses alter the functional capacity  of macrophages by inhibiting their defense mechanisms against invading pathogens. methods: macrophages preinfected with hcmv or ebv were evaluated following stimulation by selected oral bacteria. bacteria-induced macrophage activation was assayed by measuring the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) produced in the media, and phagocytic activity was analysed by a phagocytosis assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bacteria. the virus-infected macrophages were also subjected to semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure the expression of toll-like receptor 9, which is involved in the activation of phagocytosis-related pathways. results: both hcmv and ebv significantly diminished the tnf-alpha production typically induced by oral bacteria, inhibited the phagocytic activity of macrophages, and downregulated the expression of toll-like receptor 9. conclusion: infection by hcmv or ebv inhibits the functional ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial challenge, thereby  suggesting their pathogenic role in the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == tgf-beta1 inhibits tlr-mediated odontoblast responses to oral bacteria.
AB  == tgf-beta1 exerts diverse functions in tooth development and tissue repair, but its role in microbial defenses of the tooth is not well-understood. odontoblasts  extending their cellular processes into the dentin are the first cells to recognize signals from tgf-beta1 and bacteria in carious dentin. this study aimed to determine the role of tgf-beta1 in modulating odontoblast responses to oral bacteria. we show that these responses depend upon the expression levels of microbial recognition receptors tlr2 and tlr4 on the cell surface. porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum activated both tlrs, but tlr4 played a greater role. lack of cell-surface tlr2 was associated with poor response to streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus casei. tgf-beta1 inhibited tlr2 and tlr4 expression and attenuated  odontoblast responses. our findings suggest that the balance between tlr-mediated inflammation and tgf-beta1 anti-inflammatory activity plays an important role in  pulpal inflammation.

TI  == decreased interleukin-2 responses to fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: compromised t-cell responses to periodontal pathogens may contribute  to the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). in this study, we attempted to characterize t-helper cell (th1, th2, and th17) responses  in patients with gagp and healthy controls upon stimulation with disease-relevant pathogens. methods: mononuclear cells (mncs) from 10 white patients with gagp and 10 white controls were stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis american type culture collection (atcc) 33277 (pg), prevotella intermedia atcc 25611, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 49256 (fn), and similar bacteria isolated from the participants' inherent oral flora. tetanus toxoid (tt) was used as control antigen. the resulting production of interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) and interleukin (il)-2, -4, -5 and -17 and the induced proliferation of cd4+ t cells were measured. results: mncs from patients with gagp exhibited decreased il-2 responses to pg and fn. no difference was observed between patients with gagp and controls with regard to cd4+ t-cell proliferation or the production of ifn-gamma  and il-4, -5, and -17, irrespective of whether type strains or bacteria isolated  from the participants' oral cavity were used for stimulation. moreover, similar proliferative and cytokine responses to tt were observed. notably, smoking patients with gagp exhibited significantly lower ifn-gamma responses to the bacteria and to tt than non-smoking patients or controls. conclusions: the decreased il-2 responses of patients with gagp to pg and fn combined with adequate il-2 responses to tt suggest an impaired antigen-specific t-cell reactivity with periodontal pathogens in gagp. the decreased ifn-gamma responses  of smokers within the patient group suggest that smoking may aggravate this impairment.

TI  == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species  were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap  patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum  may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

TI  == tlr2 sensing of f. nucleatum and s. sanguinis distinctly triggered gingival innate response.
AB  == gingival tissue faces constant exposure to micro-organisms. it functions as part  of the host response, an anti-microbial barrier that recognizes and discriminates between commensal and pathogenic bacteria. this study aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of cell wall extracts from different periodontal bacteria, commensals streptococcus sanguinis and fusobacterium nucleatum and the pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis, on the innate immune response of gingival keratinocytes and the role of tlr2 in regulating this. we assayed mrna levels to determine the  expression of human beta-defensins (hbetad2, hbetad3), interleukin-1alpha, -1beta, 6 and 8 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. f. nucleatum extracts induced beta-defensin and inflammatory marker mrna expression at higher levels than p. gingivalis. extracts from the gram-positive commensal s. sanguinis did not upregulate the host response. tlr2 extinction inhibited the upregulation of beta-defensin and cytokine transcripts by f. nucleatum extracts but, in contrast, led to a weak induction of hbetad3 after challenge with s. sanguinis extracts. although f. nucleatum strongly induces innate immune and inflammatory mediators,  s. sanguinis limits their expression through tlr2. together, our data demonstrate that gingival keratinocytes recognize and discriminate between gram-positive and  gram-negative commensal extracts, in part through tlr2, to activate different signaling pathways of the innate immune host response.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of hydrolytic enzymes as dental plaque control agents.
AB  == the plaque-control potential of commercially available amylase, lipase and protease was evaluated by observing their effects on coaggregation and on bacterial viability within various plaque microcosms. a quantitative coaggregation assay indicated that protease significantly inhibited the extent of coaggregation of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis (p <0.05) and of porphyromonas gingivalis and s. oralis. amylase significantly (p <0.05) increased the coaggregation of a. naeslundii versus fusobacterium nucleatum and a. naeslundii versus p. gingivalis. concomitant challenge of constant-depth film fermenter-grown plaques with the enzymes did not result in detectable ecological  perturbations (assessed by differential culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). similar dosing and analysis of multiple sorbarod devices did not reveal increases in bacterial dispersion which could result from disaggregation of extant plaques. a short-term hydroxyapatite colonization model  was therefore used to investigate possible enzyme effects on early-stage plaque development. whilst culture did not indicate significant reductions in adhesion or plaque accumulation, a vital visual assay revealed significantly increased aggregation frequency following enzyme exposure. in summary, although hydrolytic  enzymes negatively influenced binary coaggregation, they did not cause statistically significant changes in bacterial viability within plaque microcosms. in contrast, enzyme exposure increased aggregation within extant plaques.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == effect of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on experimental periodontitis in the mouse.
AB  == background and objective: periodontitis is an infective disease caused predominantly by gram-negative anerobes. the host inflammatory response to these  bacteria causes alveolar bone loss, which characterizes periodontitis. omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have recognized anti-inflammatory effects; their oxygenated derivatives are key mediators in reducing inflammation. in this study  we tested the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with tuna fish oil rich in  the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, would reduce alveolar bone loss in mice inoculated with periodontopathic bacteria. material and methods: adult mice were fed experimental diets containing either 10% tuna oil or sunola oil for 57 d. after 14 d, 35 mice on each diet were inoculated orally with porphyromonas gingivalis, with a mixture of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, with carboxymethylcellulose or remained untreated. the mice were killed, and soft tissue biopsies from the oral cavity of treated mice were used to determine the polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations. the maxilla was removed, stained and digitally imaged to assess bone loss around the upper molars. results: n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels were significantly higher  in oral soft tissues of mice fed tuna oil compared with the control group. mice fed tuna oil and inoculated with p. gingivalis or with the combination of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis exhibited 72% and 54% less alveolar bone loss respectively, compared with the treatment control group. conclusion: alveolar bone loss was inversely related to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid tissue levels.  in conclusion, fish oil dietary supplementation may have potential benefits as a  host modulatory agent in the prevention and/or adjunctive management of periodontitis.

TI  == proteolytic activities of oral bacteria on prommp-9 and the effect of synthetic proteinase inhibitors.
AB  == tissue reactions to bacteria lead to proinflammatory reactions involving matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). synthetic protease inhibitors may offer new possibilities to regulate bacterial proteases. we investigated proteolytic activities of certain periodontal bacteria, their effects on the latent prommp-9, and the effects of synthetic mmp inhibitors and a serine protease inhibitor pefabloc. the strains studied were porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptoccus micros, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and 5 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. their gelatinolytic activities and the effects of certain synthetic mmp inhibitors and  pefabloc were analyzed by zymography. bacterial effects on prommp-9 conversion were investigated by western immunoblot. all investigated periodontal bacteria produced gelatinolytic cell-bound and extracellular proteinases which could fragment latent prommp-9, suggesting co-operative processing cascades in oral tissue remodeling. a. actinomycetemcomitans produced the weakest gelatinolytic activity. synthetic proteinase inhibitors exhibited slight but clear reductive effects on the bacterial proteolytic activities. we conclude that targeted anti-proteolytic treatment modalities against bacterial-host proteolytic cascades can be developed.

TI  == synergistic pathogenicity of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in the mouse subcutaneous chamber model.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum are often coisolated from sites of infection, such as suppurative apical periodontitis. the synergistic pathogenicity of mixed infection of p. gingivalis hg 405 with f. nucleatum pk 1594 was studied in the mouse subcutaneous chamber model in groups of seven animals. the minimal dose for p. gingivalis hg 405 that was required to infect 100% of the chambers was reduced by 1,000-fold when animals were inoculated in the same chamber with 1 x 10(9)f. nucleatum pk 1594 (p < 0.001). to benefit from  the presence of the fusobacteria, p. gingivalis hg 405 had to be coinoculated; inoculation in separate chambers for the same animal had no such effect (p < 0.001). subinfective f. nucleatum inocula also benefited from the association with p. gingivalis hg 405 and uniformly established an infection when this partner was present (p < 0.001). these results suggest that the frequent and natural coexistence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in diseased sites may express such a synergism in successful establishment and survival of small inocula.

TI  == enhanced attachment of porphyromonas gingivalis to human fibroblasts mediated by  fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis are often co-isolated from endodontic infection sites. the present study tested the hypothesis that adhesin-mediated reactions might contribute to this phenomenon. f. nucleaum pk1594 and p. gingivalis pk1924 were selectively labeled with fluorochromes and allowed to adhere to human fibroblasts, either each strain alone or sequentially. the number of bacteria of each type adhering to individual fibroblasts was determined. sugar inhibition profile of this adherence was explored. attachment of p. gingivalis to human fibroblasts increased by nearly 10-fold when f. nucleatum was present (p < .001). galactose, lactose, and fucose inhibited this enhanced attachment (p < .001), as well as that of f. nucleatum alone (p < .001). the results suggest that f. nucleatum might be a primary colonizer of the host tissues and serve as mediator for enhanced attachment of p. gingivalis to the host cells. this might explain in part the common co-occurrence of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis in endodontic mixed infections.

AB  == coagreggation of treponema denticola with either porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum was characterized and the role of the major outer sheath  protein (msp) in the coaggregation process of these bacteria was evaluated. the msp of t. denticola was found to be able to bind to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum cells and this binding could be inhibited by msp in a concentration-dependent manner. while sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and periodic acid-schiff (pas) staining of msp revealed that it is a glycoprotein, monosaccharide analysis showed that msp contains: glc (44.4),  gal (20.4%) glcn (1.3%), galn (31.6%) and fuc (9.2%). peptide n-glycosidase f deglycosylation of msp was found to inhibit its binding to f. nucleatum but not to p. gingivalis cells. sugar-binding studies showed that the requirements for the binding of both t. denticola and msp to f. nucleatum cells are similar to those of the f. nucleatum galactose-binding lectin. these data suggest that msp acts as an adhesin during the coaggregation process of t. denticola with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum through its protein and carbohydrate moieties, respectively.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum enhances invasion of human gingival epithelial and aortic endothelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == invasion by porphyromonas gingivalis has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. porphyromonas gingivalis have direct access to the systemic circulation and endothelium in periodontitis patients by transient bacteremia. periodontitis can be described as one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans. in the present study, p. gingivalis strains were tested for their ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell line (ca9-22) and human aortic endothelial cells in coinfection with fusobacterium nucleatum using antibiotic protection assays. coinfection with f. nucleatum resulted in 2-20-fold increase in the invasion of host cells by p. gingivalis strains. the invasive abilities of p. gingivalis strains were significantly greater when incubated with a f. nucleatum clinical isolate (which  possesses strong biofilm-forming ability), than when incubated with a f. nucleatum-type strain. in inhibition assays with metabolic inhibitors, a difference in inhibition profiles was observed between mono- and polymicrobial infections. collectively, our results suggest that f. nucleatum facilitates invasion of host cells by p. gingivalis. investigations of polymicrobial infection of host cells should improve our understanding of the role of p. gingivalis in periodontal infection and proatherogenic mechanisms.

TI  == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI  == frequency, microbial interactions, and antimicrobial susceptibility of fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum isolated from primary endodontic infections.
AB  == this study assessed the prevalence and microbial interactions of fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum in primary endodontic infections from a brazilian population and their antimicrobial susceptibility to some antibiotics by the e-test. one hundred ten samples from infected teeth with periapical pathologies were analyzed by culture methods. five hundred eighty individual strains were isolated; 81.4% were strict anaerobes. f. nucleatum was found in 38  root canals and was associated with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., and eubacterium spp. f. necrophorum was found in 20 root canals and was associated with peptostreptococcus prevotii. the simultaneous presence of f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum was not related to endodontic symptoms (p > 0.05). they were 100% susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and cephaclor. fusobacterium spp. is frequently isolated from primary-infected root canals of teeth with periapical pathologies. amoxicillin is a useful antibiotic against f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum in endodontic infections and has been prescribed as the first choice in brazil.

TI  == participation of glutathione in the elimination of porphyromonas gingivalis in vivo.
AB  == introduction: glutathione is involved in immune responses such as cell proliferation and bactericidal activity. the aim of this study was to see whether glutathione influences the intraperitoneal elimination of porphyromonas gingivalis in fusobacterium nucleatum-immunized mice. methods: mice were immunized with p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum, and then p. gingivalis was inoculated into the peritoneal cavity of the mice. after various lengths of time, the numbers of bacteria were determined by a colony-forming assay and by polymerase chain reaction. the effect of glutathione on the elimination of p. gingivalis was explored by changing the intracellular glutathione level. furthermore, we examined the effects of glutathione on the peritoneal levels of interferon-gamma, a macrophage activator, and of nitrite, a derivative of nitric  oxide that acts as an antimicrobial agent when produced by macrophages and neutrophils. results: inoculated p. gingivalis was eliminated more rapidly from f. nucleatum-immunized mice than from p. gingivalis-immunized mice. interferon-gamma levels in peritoneal lavage fluid and glutathione levels in peritoneal exudate cells were higher in f. nucleatum-immunized mice than in p. gingivalis-immunized mice. when p. gingivalis-immunized mice were given glutathione monoethylester (a derivative of glutathione that is converted to glutathione intracellularly through hydrolysis) into the peritoneal cavity, the elimination of p. gingivalis was accelerated. on the other hand, when f. nucleatum-immunized mice were given l-buthionine-[s,r]-sulfoximine (an inhibitor  of glutathione synthesis) into the peritoneal cavity, the elimination of p. gingivalis was suppressed. conclusion: in f. nucleatum-immunized mice, glutathione may have a key role in the defense against p. gingivalis infections.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == comparison of culture methods and multiplex pcr for the detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in biofilm associated with severe forms of periodontitis.
AB  == conventional culture methods and multiplex pcr, both of which we have been used for a long time in our clinical microbiology laboratory, were compared for their  ability to detect a selected panel of periodontopathic bacteria: aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. tests were performed in a single subgingival sample taken from a periodontal diseased site with a probing depth equal to or greater than 6mm. the results were compared site-by-site, taking into account the quality and the presence or absence of pathogens. 529 samples of subgingival plaque were analysed and the prevalence of  the six species monitored varied in relation to the species itself and the method of detection. the most represented species is f. nucleatum, with a percentage of  positive variability between 44.9% pcr and 46.5% culture test. generally, the lowest prevalence was determined by culture test, with the exception of e. corrodens and f. nucleatum, which, unlike other bacteria, have been seen in higher percentages in culture with respect to pcr. for both methods, there was a  good degree of accuracy in the determination of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, and p. gingivalis. it becomes weak for f. nucleatum and p.  intermedia. both culture and pcr techniques introduced many methodological problems when applied in oral microbiology, but the ideal technique for accurate  detection of pathogens in subgingival plaque samples has yet to be developed.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (eswt) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar  bone lost through periodontal disease. the objective of the present study was to  determine any antibacterial effect of eswt on oral bacteria. monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of eswt at energy flux densities (efd) of 0.12 mj/mm(2), 0.22 mj/mm(2), and 0.3 mj/mm(2). following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. eswt showed a significant microbicidal effect for streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mj/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). in addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower efds. no significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at efds and pulses tested (p > 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy eswt may be  bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.

TI  == rapid identification of oral anaerobic bacteria cultivated from subgingival biofilm by maldi-tof-ms.
AB  == introduction: to facilitate the identification of anaerobes cultivated from periodontal disease, whole cell bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) was evaluated. methods: a total of 84 strains (nine reference strains and 75 recent clinical isolates from 33 patients with aggressive periodontitis) previously identified with phenotypic methods were used. all the references and 10 clinical  isolates belonging to the same species as the reference strains were genotypically identified by sequence analysis of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. all  the strains were then analyzed using maldi-tof-ms. results: the reference strains of anaerobic bacteria used showed characteristic maldi-tof-ms spectra with peaks  between m/z 2000 and up to about m/z 13,000. on visual inspection, the similarity of spectra produced by strains of a single genus could be recognized. obvious differences between spectra produced by strains of different species were also easily noticed. the reproducibility of the method was proved by the similarity of spectra belonging to the same species. the spectra of the prevotella intermedia strains identified with maldi clustered together and clustered separately from the spectra of prevotella nigrescens, proving that maldi-tof-ms is an accurate method that is capable of separating these two species. the quality of clustering was characterized by calculating an inconsistency coefficient (mathworks:/matlab  reference manual v2007a/, statistical toolbox). conclusion: our results suggest that maldi-tof-ms might become a useful method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, especially for those that cannot be readily identified by biochemical analysis. it may become an attractive system even for the routine identification of clinical isolates.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == rapid quantification of periodontitis-related bacteria using a novel modification of invader plus technologies.
AB  == the invader plus technology is a sensitive, rapid method for the detection and quantification of nucleic acid. while the original technology is based on the amplification by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of the target sequence followed  by its detection using the invader technology, the current modification allows simultaneous pcr amplification and invader reaction. the pcr primers and the invader probes are designed to operate at the same temperature. this allows simpler design and faster results. this technology has been applied for the quantification of six periodontitis-related bacteria (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, toreponema denticola, tannerella forsythensis and fusobacterium nucleatum). direct comparison of this modified invader plus with real-time pcr demonstrated similar linear range. furthermore, testing of 64 volunteers showed a good correlation between both technologies with correlation factors r2 spanning between 0.827 and 0.987. we demonstrated here that the proposed improvement of the invader plus allows the detection and quantification of dna sequences using a simple design and protocol that can be implemented in clinical testing.

AB  == background and objective: dietary manipulation, including caloric restriction, has been shown to impact host response capabilities significantly, particularly in association with aging. this investigation compared systemic inflammatory and  immune-response molecules in rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta). material and methods: monkeys on continuous long-term calorie-restricted diets and a matched group of animals on a control ad libitum diet, were examined for systemic response profiles including the effects of both gender and aging. results: the results demonstrated that haptoglobin and alpha1-antiglycoprotein levels were elevated in the serum of male monkeys. serum igg responses to campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were significantly elevated in female monkeys. while only the antibody to fusobacterium nucleatum was significantly affected by the calorie-restricted diet in female monkeys, antibody levels to prevotella intermedia, c. rectus and treponema denticola demonstrated a similar trend. conclusion: in this investigation, only certain serum antibody levels were influenced by the age of male animals, which was seemingly related to increasing clinical disease in this  gender. more generally, analytes were modulated by gender and/or diet in this oral model system of mucosal microbial challenge.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the effect of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. it also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. single-species biofilms of streptococcus gordonii, porphyromonas gingivalis, or fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of s. gordonii -- f. nucleatum and f. nucleatum -- p. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. the viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. high-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. susceptibility tests and viability assays showed  that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. high-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. these findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == the anti-endotoxic effects of the ksl-w decapeptide on escherichia coli o55:b5 and various oral lipopolysaccharides.
AB  == background and objective: host responses following the recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide can range from acute inflammation to septic shock. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the ability of the ksl-w decapeptide to bind to and block the endotoxic effects of lipopolysaccharide. material and methods: an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay using fluorescently labeled ksl-w to detect adsorbed escherichia coli o55:b5 lipopolysaccharide was employed. a commercially available recombinant factor c lipopolysaccharide detection assay, hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes as well as e-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the anti-endotoxic effects after ksl-w exposure to e. coli lipopolysaccharide as well as to oral lipopolysaccharide samples. results: lipopolysaccharide-binding assays using e. coli o55:b5 lipopolysaccharide revealed both a higher maximal binding range (532-713 microm) and a half-maximum binding concentration (70-185 microm) for the ksl-w peptide when compared with its analog control. significant inhibition of e-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (p < 0.0001) as well as hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes occurred after the interaction of ksl-w with e. coli lipopolysaccharide. recombinant factor c enzyme detection inhibition revealed dose-dependent inhibition values ranging from 1.0-51.8 microm. which were dependent upon the type of lipopolysaccharide sample tested. conclusion: these results demonstrate that for the concentrations tested, the ksl-w decapeptide was nontoxic to mammalian cells and could bind to and block the host recognition and response towards enteric, as well as oral, lipopolysaccharide samples.

TI  == photodynamic treatment of endodontic polymicrobial infection in vitro.
AB  == we investigated the photodynamic effects of methylene blue on multispecies root canal biofilms comprising actinomyces israelii, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in experimentally infected root canals of extracted human teeth in vitro. the 4 test microorganisms were detected in root canals by using dna probes. scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of biofilms in root canals before therapy. root canal systems were incubated with methylene blue (25 microg/ml) for 10 minutes followed by exposure to red light at 665 nm with an energy fluence of  30 j/cm(2). light was delivered from a diode laser via a 250-microm diameter polymethyl methacrylate optical fiber that uniformly distributed light over 360 degrees. photodynamic therapy (pdt) achieved up to 80% reduction of colony-forming unit counts. we concluded that pdt can be an effective adjunct to  standard endodontic antimicrobial treatment when the pdt parameters are optimized.

TI  == quercetin in a lotus leaves extract may be responsible for antibacterial activity.
AB  == in the course of a search for chemotherapeutic agents inhibiting suspected peridontitis bacteria, extracted and purified substances from lotus leaf were identified by antimicrobial activity tests with use of the broth micro-dilution methods on 96-microwell plate. the antimicrobial activity of extracts was tested  against five microorganisms, namely: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, actinomyces viscosus 19246, porphyromonas gingivalis 33277, fusobacterium nucleatum 25586, and actinomyces naeslundii wvl 45. the most active antimicrobial extract was subjected to spectroscopic analysis using uv, mass spectrometry, and  by (1)h, (13)c-, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. our data showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the most active extract were 0.625, 1.25, 1.25, 0.625 and 2.5 mg/ml for a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and a. naeslundii, respectively. the component that had a greatest antimicrobial activity was determined to be quercetin. thus, we conclude that quercetin extracted from lotus leaves may be a potential antibacterial agent for periodontitis.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients on periodontal maintenance: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  == recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of pdt in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy  were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). the following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (fmps), full mouth bleeding score (fmbs), bleeding on probing (bop) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (rec), and clinical attachment level (cal). primary outcome variables were changes in ppd and cal. microbiological evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), tannerella forsythensis (t.f.), treponema denticola (t.d.), peptostreptococcus micros (p.m.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), campylobacter rectus (c.r.), eubacterium nodatum (e.n.), eikenella corrodens (e.c.), and capnocytophaga species (c.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. no differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. at 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of ppd, cal and fmps. at 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of bop was found in the test group. at 3 months  after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of f.n. and e.n. in the test group. at 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of e.c. and c.s. were detected in the test group. the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of ppd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == effects of age and oral disease on systemic inflammatory and immune parameters in nonhuman primates.
AB  == this report evaluated systemic inflammatory and immune biomarkers in a cohort of  macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) maintained as a large family social unit, including an age range from <1 year to >24 years. we hypothesized that the systemic host responses would be affected by the age, gender, and clinical oral presentation of the population, each contributing to inflammatory and immune responses that would reflect chronic oral infections. the results demonstrated that the prevalence and severity of periodontitis, including missing teeth, increased significantly with age. generally, minimal differences in clinical parameters were noted between the genders. systemic inflammatory mediators, including acute-phase reactants, prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), cytokines/chemokines, and selected matrix metalloproteinases (mmp), demonstrated  significant differences among the various age groups of animals. levels of many of these were increased with age, although pge(2), rantes, bactericidal permeability-inducing factor (bpi), mmp-1, and mmp-9 levels were significantly increased in the young group ( approximately 1 to 3 years old) relative to those  for the older animals. we observed that in the adult and aged animals, levels of  the systemic inflammatory mediators related to gingival inflammation and periodontal tissue destruction were significantly elevated. serum antibody levels in response to a battery of periodontal pathogens were generally lower in the young animals, <50% of those in the adults, and were significantly related to aging in the cohort. the levels of antibodies, particularly those to porphorymonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and tannerella forsythia, were most significantly elevated in animals with periodontal disease, irrespective of  the age of the animal. these results provide a broad description of oral health and host responses in a large cohort of nonhuman primates from very young animals to the aged of this species. the findings afford a base of data with which to examine the ontogeny of host responses at mucosal sites, such as the gingival tissues.

TI  == serum antibodies to porphyromonas gingivalis chaperone htpg predict health in periodontitis susceptible patients.
AB  == background: chaperones are ubiquitous conserved proteins critical in stabilization of new proteins, repair/removal of defective proteins and immunodominant antigens in innate and adaptive immunity. periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory infection associated with infection by porphyromonas gingivalis that culminates in the destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth. we previously reported studies of serum antibodies reactive with the human chaperone hsp90 in gingivitis, a reversible form of gingival disease confined to  the oral soft tissues. in those studies, antibodies were at their highest levels  in subjects with the best oral health. we hypothesized that antibodies to the hsp90 homologue of p. gingivalis (htpg) might be associated with protection/resistance against destructive periodontitis. methodology/principal findings: elisa assays using cloned htpg and peptide antigens confirmed gingivitis subjects colonized with p. gingivalis had higher serum levels of anti-htpg and, concomitantly, lower levels of attachment loss. additionally, serum antibody levels to p. gingivalis htpg protein were higher in healthy subjects compared to patients with either chronic or aggressive periodontitis. we found a negative association between tooth attachment loss and anti-p. gingivalis htpg (p = 0.043) but not anti-fusobacterium nucleatum (an oral opportunistic commensal) htpg levels. furthermore, response to periodontal therapy was more successful in subjects having higher levels of anti-p. gingivalis htpg before treatment (p = 0.018). there was no similar relationship to anti-f. nucleatum htpg levels. similar results were obtained when these experiments were repeated with a synthetic peptide of a region of p. gingivalis htpg. conclusions/significance: our results suggest: 1) anti-p. gingivalis htpg antibodies are protective and therefore predict health periodontitis-susceptable  patients; 2) may augment the host defence to periodontitis and 3) a unique peptide of p. gingivalis htpg offers significant potential as an effective diagnostic target and vaccine candidate. these results are compatible with a novel immune control mechanism unrelated to direct binding of bacteria.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

TI  == role of porphyromonas gingivalis serb in gingival epithelial cell cytoskeletal remodeling and cytokine production.
AB  == the serb protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is a had family serine phosphatase that plays a critical role in entry and survival of the organism in gingival epithelial cells. serb is secreted by p. gingivalis upon contact with epithelial  cells. here it is shown by microarray analysis that serb impacts the transcriptional profile of gingival epithelial cells, with pathways involving the actin cytoskeleton and cytokine production among those significantly overpopulated with differentially regulated genes. consistent with the transcriptional profile, a serb mutant of p. gingivalis exhibited defective remodeling of actin in epithelial cells. interaction between gingival epithelial  cells and isolated serb protein resulted in actin rearrangement and an increase in the f/g actin ratio. serb protein was also required for p. gingivalis to antagonize interleukin-8 accumulation following stimulation of epithelial cells with fusobacterium nucleatum. serb is thus capable of modulating host cell signal transduction that impacts the actin cytoskeleton and cytokine production.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens in subgingival lesions, atherosclerotic plaques and healthy blood vessels: a preliminary study.
AB  == background and objective: previous studies have reported different periodontal bacteria in atherosclerotic lesions, but their involvement in plaque formation remains unclear. the aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of  20 periodontal bacteria in atherosclerotic samples and healthy blood vessels (used as controls) and to clarify their relationship in regard to clinical and bacteriological periodontal status. material and methods: the day before vascular surgery the patients had a thorough periodontal examination and bacteriological samples were taken from periodontally diseased sites. atheromatous plaques, internal mammary arteries and saphenous veins were harvested during surgery. a dna-dna hybridization procedure was used to screen periodontal and vascular samples for the 20 selected bacterial species. results: periodontal samples from  the severe periodontitis group were found to have a higher prevalence and biomass of bacterial species than the moderate periodontitis group. in vessel samples, the prevalence of the same 20 bacterial species analyzed together was similar in  the two groups, except for saphenous veins. conclusion: the presence of periodontal pathogens in atherosclerotic plaques and in apparently healthy vessels appeared to reflect a higher level of bacteremia rather than infection of endothelial cells.

TI  == interactions between salivary bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  == coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. bifidobacterium adolescentis olb6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii jcm8350, streptococcus mitis ols3293, streptococcus sanguinis jcm5708, veillonella parvula atcc17745 or porphyromonas gingivalis ob7124, but it did coaggregate with fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using fish revealed that b. adolescentis olb6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. it did, however, adhere to biofilms of a. naeslundii, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with a. naeslundii nor with v.  parvula. these results suggest that the adhesion of b. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. heat- or proteinase k-treated f. nucleatum could not coaggregate with b. adolescentis. similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase k-treated b. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. it is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of b. adolescentis and f. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. the data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.

TI  == generation of indole/skatole during malodor formation in the salivary sediment model system and initial examination of the oral bacteria involved.
AB  == gram negative anaerobic microbial degradation of proteins, peptides and amino acids in saliva leads to production of oral malodor. volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) from cysteine and indole/skatole (i/s) from tryptophan are two major components of breath odor. in this study, salivary mixed bacteria and oral pure cultures were compared for their ability to produce odor from cysteine, tryptophan and salivary supernatant. the vsc malodor inhibitor, zinc, was used to help identify the malodor processes involved. salivary sediment and salivary supernatant were both obtained from wax-stimulated whole saliva. gram positive (13) and gram negative (12) oral pure cultures of common salivary bacteria were each grown in appropriate media and harvested. incubation mixtures were prepared  with salivary sediment at 16.7% (v/v) or bacterial pure cultures at 8.3% (v/v). cysteine or tryptophan at 6 mm or salivary supernatant at 33.3% (v/v) was added.  when included, zinc as zncl(2) was added at 6 mm. all incubations were carried out for 24 h at 37 degrees c. odor generation was assessed organoleptically (0-4  severity scale); vsc was determined with a halimeter (interscan corp., chatsworth, ca) and i/s was determined using kovac's colorimetric method. organoleptic odor levels produced by salivary sediment mixed bacteria with the three substrates tested were comparable, though tryptophan and cysteine generated distinct and characteristic odors. with cysteine and supernatant, rapid and substantial vsc was generated; with tryptophan no such vsc formation was observed. zinc inhibited vsc generation from cysteine and from salivary supernatant but had no effect on i/s from tryptophan. surprisingly though, zinc which had no effect on i/s production from free tryptophan, reduced i/s production from supernatant. of the 12 gram negative bacteria, 75% produced i/s (mean 3.1 +/- 1.5 sem mg ml(-1)); most was generated by porphyromonas intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. gram positive pure cultures produced none. comparable levels of organoleptic odor were produced by porphyromonas gingivalis from tryptophan and cysteine. malodor produced orally is complex because multiple microbial types, substrates, metabolic pathways and hence end products are involved. zinc clearly inhibited i/s production in salivary supernatant, possibly by interfering with the release of tryptophan from peptides/proteins.

TI  == in vitro antioxidant potential of medicinal plant extracts and their activities against oral bacteria based on brazilian folk medicine.
AB  == background and objectives: this study aims to determine antibacterial activities  of cocos nucifera (husk fiber), ziziphus joazeiro (inner bark), caesalpinia pyramidalis (leaves), aqueous extracts and aristolochia cymbifera (rhizomes) alcoholic extract against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei. the antioxidant activity and acute toxicity of these extracts were also evaluated. material and methods: the plant extracts antibacterial activity was evaluated in  vitro and the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the broth  micro-dilution assay. the bacterial killing kinetic was also evaluated for all extracts. in addition, the antibacterial effect of the extracts was tested in vitro on artificial oral biofilms. the acute toxicity of each extract was determined in according to lorke [lorke d. a new approach to practical acute toxicity testing. arch toxicol 1983;54:275-87] and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by dpph photometric assay [mensor ll, menezes fs, leitao gg, reis as, santos tc, coube cs, et al. screening of brazilian plants extract for antioxidant activity by the use of dpph free radical method. phytother res 2001;15:127-30]. results: mic and the bactericidal concentrations were identical, for each evaluated extract. however, microbes of artificial biofilms were less sensitive to the extracts than the planktonic strains. a. cymbifera extract induced the highest bactericidal effect against all tested bacteria, followed by c. nucifera, z. joazeiro and c. pyramidalis extracts, respectively. all extracts showed good antioxidant potential, being c. nucifera and c. pyramidalis aqueous extracts the  most active ones. conclusion: in conclusion, all oral bacteria tested (planktonic or in artificial biofilms) were more susceptible to, and rapidly killed in presence of a. cymbifera, c. pyramidalis and c. nucifera than z. joazeiro extracts, respectively. thus, these extracts may be of great interest for future  studies about treatment of oral diseases, considering their potent antioxidant activity and low toxicity.

TI  == relationship between campylobacter rectus and periodontal status during pregnancy.
AB  == introduction: in a previous study, we showed that the growth of campylobacter rectus is stimulated by the presence of female sex hormones in the culture medium. in the present study, we examined the relationship between c. rectus levels in the saliva and the periodontal status of pregnant women. methods: unstimulated whole saliva was collected from 22 pregnant and 15 non-pregnant women. periodontal pocket depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the concentrations of suspected periodontopathogenic bacteria in the saliva samples.  in addition, the concentration of estradiol in the saliva samples was measured by enzyme immunoassay. results: the average age, number of teeth, and total number of bacteria in the saliva of subjects in both groups were similar. the percentage of sites with a pd = 4 mm and the salivary estradiol concentrations were significantly higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. in addition, the percentage of bop sites and the c. rectus levels in the saliva of the pregnant women tended to be higher than in non-pregnant women, although these differences were not statistically significant. there were positive correlations  between c. rectus levels and estradiol concentrations, and between c. rectus levels and the percentage of sites with pd = 4 mm in the pregnant women. conclusion: these results indicate that c. rectus levels are higher in the oral flora of pregnant women and that this may be associated with increased salivary estradiol concentrations. this may contribute to periodontal disease progression  during pregnancy.

TI  == stimulation of fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/aims: bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. the aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas  gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. methods: microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees c under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. results: f. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. biofilm formation by f. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by p. gingivalis. it was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with p. gingivalis. enhancement of biofilm formation  by p. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxs. conclusion: the results suggest that p. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by f. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.

TI  == quantitative analysis of association between herpesviruses and bacterial pathogens in periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the development of human periodontitis may depend upon  cooperative interactions among herpesviruses, specific pathogenic bacteria and tissue-destructive inflammatory mediators. this study sought to identify associations among human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus and six putative periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis lesions. material and methods: fifteen periodontitis patients (nine with aggressive periodontitis and six with chronic periodontitis) and 15 periodontally normal subjects were included in the study. in each study subject, a microbiological sample was collected, using a curette, from the deepest periodontal probing depth of the dentition. a real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction assay was employed to determine the subgingival counts  of human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus. statistical analysis was performed using the student's t-test, the pearson correlation coefficient test and the single variable logistic regression test for odds ratio-based risk calculation. results: human cytomegalovirus was detected in eight periodontitis lesions and in one normal periodontal site, epstein-barr virus was detected in nine periodontitis lesions and in two normal periodontal sites, and the study bacteria were detected in 6-15 periodontitis lesions and in  1-11 normal periodontal sites. correlations were found between counts of human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus, between counts of human cytomegalovirus and p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and c. rectus, and between counts of epstein-barr virus and p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr  virus counts were also positively associated with the level of periodontal attachment loss, probing pocket depth and gingival bleeding on probing. conclusion: this study confirmed that periodontal human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus are associated with major periodontopathic bacteria and with the severity of periodontal disease. the finding of abundant herpesviruses in periodontitis lesions redefines the pathogenic paradigm of the disease. understanding the interplay between herpesviruses and specific bacterial species  in the pathogenesis of periodontitis may form the basis for new approaches to preventing, reducing or delaying tissue breakdown from periodontal infections.

TI  == analysis of the antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics used for dental analgesia.
AB  == seven local anaesthetics and their active anaesthetic components [ultracaine d-s  (articaine hydrochloride), carbostesin (bupivacaine hydrochloride), scandicaine (mepivacaine hydrochloride), xylonest (prilocaine hydrochloride), xylocaine (lidocaine hydrochloride), hostacaine (butanilicaine phosphate) and novocaine (procaine hydrochloride)] were tested for their antimicrobial activity against 311 bacterial strains from 52 different species and 14 candida albicans strains.  the tested pathogens were members of the oral flora, and partly members of the skin and intestinal flora. additionally, the antimicrobial activity of methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, sodium disulfite, adrenaline hydrogen tartrate and adrenaline (the preservative and vasoconstrictive components of the anaesthetics) was tested. for determination of mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), the agar dilution method using wilkins-chalgren agar was applied. the trade preparation ultracaine d-s showed the most prominent antimicrobial activity with regard to both mic and mbc. ultracaine d-s and its active substance, articaine hydrochloride, showed similar mic values, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity is mainly caused by the anaesthetic component. novocaine showed the lowest antimicrobial activity and did not inhibit 35 of the species tested. the mic values of all local anaesthetics were between 0.25 and 16 mg ml(-1). the routinely applied concentration of ultracaine d-s was roughly four times higher, and of hostacaine was two times higher, than the mbc values for the tested bacteria, whereas for the other anaesthetics, the mbc values were not reached or exceeded with the concentrations used. the mic range of the preservatives was 0.5-1.0 mg ml(-1) for methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and 0.2-0.5 mg ml(-1) for sodium disulfite. the articaine mic values were two to three serial dilution steps lower, and the butanilicaine mic values one to two serial dilution steps lower, than the mic of the preservatives. the mepivacaine mean mic values were slightly lower for fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and staphylococcus aureus, but higher for streptococcus  intermedius, compared with the preservative methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate. the same result was found with streptococcus intermedius and lidocaine. screening of 20 mic values of 4 pure anaesthetic substances and the corresponding preservative found 2/20 instances where the mics of the preservatives against 5 representative species (67 strains) were lower, indicating that the antimicrobial effect was mainly due to the preservative, but 18/20 results where the pure anaesthetic component showed greater antimicrobial effects compared with the preservative. the in vitro results for carbostesin, scandicaine and especially for novocaine indicate that a local disinfection should be done prior to injection of the anaesthetics. due to the results obtained with nosocomial strains (escherichia coli, s. aureus and pseudomonas), disinfection of the mucous membranes should be  performed routinely in immunocompromised patients, regardless of the anaesthetic  used.

TI  == effect of rinsing with an essential oil-containing mouthrinse on subgingival periodontopathogens.
AB  == background: studies have shown that the nature and amount of supragingival plaque can influence the composition of the contiguous subgingival flora. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of rinsing with an essential oil antimicrobial mouthrinse on levels of representative subgingival bacteria in subjects with mild to moderate periodontitis. methods: this controlled study used a randomized, double-masked, 2 x 2 crossover design. after baseline subgingival sampling, 37 qualifying subjects rinsed with the essential oil mouthrinse or a negative control twice daily for 14 days, with a post-treatment sample obtained on day 15. following a washout period, the procedure was repeated with the alternative rinse. target organisms enumerated were porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella sp., and total anaerobes. intergroup comparisons of post-treatment log-transformed colony forming unit counts were made using analysis of covariance. results: after 14 days of twice-daily rinsing, the level of each of the target subgingival organisms was significantly lower in  the essential oil group than in the control group (p < 0.001), with percent reductions ranging from 66.3% to 79.2%. conclusions: rinsing with the essential oil antiplaque/antigingivitis mouthrinse can have significant antimicrobial activity against subgingival periodontopathogens. most likely, the antimicrobial  effect was mediated primarily by disruption of the contiguous supragingival plaque by the mouthrinse. because studies have shown that control of supragingival plaque can influence the onset and/or progression of periodontitis, additional studies on non-prescription antimicrobial oral care products may lead  to new regimens for decreasing the burden of periodontal diseases in the population.

TI  == effect of tissue fluids on hydrophobicity and adherence of enterococcus faecalis  to dentin.
AB  == this in vitro study was carried out to determine (1) the hydrophobicity of selected oral bacteria, (2) the influence of growth media (saliva and serum) and  mode of growth (planktonic or biofilm) on the hydrophobicity of enterococcus faecalis, and (3) the influence of growth media and conditioning fluids on the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the ability to bind to a hydrocarbon phase (xylene) was used as an index of relative hydrophobicity of cells. fluorescent microscopy-based technique was used to assay the bacterial adherence to dentin. results showed that bacteria involved in the primary stage of oral biofilm formation such as streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis are relatively more hydrophobic than e. faecalis. the hydrophobicity of e. faecalis was significantly increased during starvation and biofilm mode of growth (p < .05). the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin was appreciably increased after starvation and when dentin was conditioned with saliva. it was observed that surface conditioning of dentin with saliva and starvation can enhance the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the findings from  this study indicated that the coronal leakage of saliva and the physiologic state of microbes might play an important role in the adherence and biofilm formation of bacteria to root canal dentin.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of triclosan and triclosan with gantrez on five common endodontic pathogens.
AB  == microbial control of the root canal system is one of the key objectives of root canal therapy. triclosan is a widely accepted broad spectrum antimicrobial agent  proven to be effective against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. triclosan acts by blocking bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. the addition of gantrez copolymer has been shown to enhance the antimicrobial activity of triclosan. the purpose of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory and  bactericidal concentrations of triclosan and triclosan with gantrez against prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, and enterococcus faecalis. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of both test solutions was determined for each of the 5 microorganisms by using microtiter serial dilutions. samples were streaked on 5%  sheep blood agar plates and placed in an anaerobic incubator to determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc). the mbc of triclosan ranged from 12-94  microg/ml. the mbc of triclosan with gantrez ranged from <0.3-10.4 microg/ml. the addition of gantrez enhanced the bactericidal activity of triclosan. both triclosan and triclosan with gantrez demonstrated bactericidal activity against the 5 specific endodontic pathogens.

AB  == background: this 6-month study evaluated the effects of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (rmgi) and microfilled composite (mc) subgingival restorations on periodontal tissues and subgingival biofilm. methods: fifty-four  periodontally healthy patients were assigned as follows: group 1 (n = 18), root exposure (re) without non-carious cervical lesions (nccl) treated with coronally  positioned flap (cpf); group 2 (n = 18), re with nccl treated rmgi restorations plus cpf; group 3 (n = 18), re with nccl treated with mc restorations plus cpf. probing depth (pd), visible local plaque score (pl), and local bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed at baseline and 6 months after surgeries. restored and non-restored root recoverage (rr) was assessed at 6 months. each experimental tooth was subgingivally sampled (baseline and 6 months) and analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: clinical results showed no significant differences among the groups regarding pl, bop, and pd at baseline and 6 months. the rr means were similar among the groups at 6 months. intragroup  analyses revealed that the proportions of 10 periodontopathogens decreased at 6 months for the control group. for the rmgi group, there was a significant decrease in the proportions of nine periodontopathogens. for the mc group, there  was a significant increase in the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum and gemella morbillorum and a decrease in five periodontopathogens. intergroup analyses showed an increase in the proportion of f. nucleatum polymorphum for the mc group. conclusions: in a 6-month evaluation, well-finished rmgi or mc subgingival restorations did not negatively affect periodontal health. furthermore, rmgi seems to exert more positive effects on the subgingival biofilm composition than mc.

TI  == targeted profiling of oral bacteria in human saliva and in vitro biofilms with quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == an in vitro plaque model based on the use of human salivary bacteria and tooth-like surfaces was previously developed for studying the formation of oral biofilm and its use for pre-clinical testing of candidate antimicrobial or antiplaque agents. in this study, a quantitative taqman pcr assay (qpcr) was developed to compare the bacterial compositions of in vitro biofilms to parent saliva samples, and to determine the relative contributions of different species  in the formation of the oral biofilm. in addition, the growth inhibition of saliva-derived plaque was evaluated by chlorhexidine. with this assay, which consisted of primer/probe sets targeting either 16s rdna sequences present in public databases or cloned ribosomal intergenic spacer region (isr) sequences, 15 oral bacteria derived from saliva as well as those that were responsible for biofilm formation in an in vitro plaque model were rapidly identified and quantified. among the target organisms were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, micromonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, tannerella forsythensis, and veillonella parvula. primer and probe sets developed were both sensitive and specific. the relative profiles of a number of bacteria in 45-h-old biofilms were determined and, when compared to saliva samples, it was found that most of the bacteria identified in  saliva also populated the in vitro plaque, including some anaerobes. brief exposure of biofilms to chlorhexidine resulted in significant losses in viability. this new broad spectrum qpcr assay in combination with the in vitro plaque model will be of significant value in the quantitative study of the microbial composition of human saliva, saliva-derived plaque, and pre-clinical evaluation of potential antimicrobial and antiplaque molecules.

TI  == cultivable bacteria in infected root canals as identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == introduction: traditionally, cultivable bacteria isolated from infected root canals have been identified by phenotype-based methods. because 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing has emerged as a more accurate and reliable tool for bacterial identification, the present study applied this approach to identify bacterial isolates recovered from the root canals of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis. methods: anaerobic techniques were used for culturing; identification of the isolates was carried out by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of the v5-v8 region of the 16s rrna gene. bacteria were found in all samples. the mean number of taxa per canal was 3.1, ranging from 2 to 8. the median number of cultivable bacterial cells in the root canals was 4.2 x 10(5), ranging from 2.8 x 10(3) to 3.3 x 10(7). eighty-seven strains belonging to 52 bacterial taxa were identified. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, micromonas micros and streptococci. the following bacterial phyla  were represented in this study: firmicutes (22 taxa, 46% of the identified isolates), actinobacteria (14 taxa, 25.3% of the isolates), bacteroidetes (eight  taxa, 13.8% of the isolates), fusobacteria (three taxa, 9.2% of the isolates) and proteobacteria (five taxa, 5.7% of the isolates). some of the isolates represented unnamed species not previously cultivated and characterized. in conclusion, our findings using a combined anaerobic culture-molecular identification approach confirmed the polymicrobial nature of primary endodontic  infections with dominance of anaerobic bacteria. notably several bacteria that are difficult or impossible to identify by phenotypic means were identified, including previously uncultivated taxa, cultivated-but-not-yet-characterized taxa and newly named species.

TI  == association of a high-molecular weight arginine-binding protein of fusobacterium  nucleatum atcc 10953 with adhesion to secretory immunoglobulin a and coaggregation with streptococcus cristatus.
AB  == introduction: fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregates with a diverse range of bacterial species, and binds to host tissues and proteins such as immunoglobulin. these interactions may support the attachment of a variety of organisms to oral surfaces and can facilitate the invasion of soft tissues. we hypothesized that coaggregation with streptococci and immunoglobulin binding may occur by a common  adhesin sensitive to l-arginine. methods: repeated mixing of f. nucleatum with non-immune secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) and recovery of non-agglutinating cells isolated a spontaneous mutant (isolate 21) of f. nucleatum that was defective in s-iga binding. wild-type and mutant f. nucleatum were compared by coaggregation and adhesion assays. results: isolate 21 exhibited significantly reduced s-iga binding and coaggregation with oral streptococci but not with porphyromonas gingivalis. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the mutant was deficient compared to wild-type for  a single protein of approximately 360 kilodaltons. the corresponding protein was  isolated from wild-type f. nucleatum protein preparations by coprecipitation with arginine-agarose beads. this protein was able to bind both streptococcus cristatus and s-iga. mass spectrometry analysis indicated that this protein was closely related to putative autotransporter proteins in other f. nucleatum strains and was a 100% match to the deduced amino acid sequence of a 10,638-base-pair open reading frame in the incomplete genome sequence of f. nucleatum atcc 10,953. peptides identified by ms-ms analysis spanned most of the  predicted amino acid sequence, suggesting that the mature protein is not subject  to postsecretory cleavage. conclusion: coaggregation represents a novel function  within the autotransporter class of proteins, which are often associated with virulence.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == bacterial species in subgingival plaque and oral bone loss in postmenopausal women.
AB  == background: oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. we investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. methods: a cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the buffalo, new york women's health initiative observational study was conducted. standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ach). subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. results: the most prevalent infection was streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by prevotella intermedia (43.4%), tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), campylobacter rectus (17.4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). infections with p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, and c. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ach, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. the body mass index (bmi) was a modifier of this association. overweight women with t. forsythensis infection were more likely to  have oral bone loss (or = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.08 to 5.46) than  normal weight (or = 1.27; 95% ci: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (or = 1.26, 95% ci: 0.72 to 2.20) women with t. forsythensis infection. conclusions: the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal  women. those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of bmi and/or inflammatory factors.

TI  == periodontal bacterial dna suppresses the immune response to mutans streptococcal  glucosyltransferase.
AB  == certain cpg motifs found in bacterial dna enhance immune responses through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and may also demonstrate adjuvant properties. our objective was to determine if dna from bacteria associated with periodontal disease could affect the immune response to other bacterial antigens in the oral  cavity. streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase (gtf), an enzyme involved in dental caries pathogenesis, was used as a test antigen. rowett rats were injected with aluminum hydroxide (alum) with buffer, alum-gtf, or alum-gtf together with either escherichia coli dna, fusobacterium nucleatum dna, or porphyromonas gingivalis dna. contrary to expectation, animals receiving alum-gtf plus bacterial dna (p. gingivalis in particular) demonstrated significantly reduced serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody, salivary iga antibody, and t-cell proliferation to gtf compared to animals immunized with alum-gtf alone. a diminished antibody response was also observed after administration of alum-gtf with the p. gingivalis dna either together or separately, indicating that physical complexing of antigen and dna was not responsible for the reduction in antibody. since tlr triggering by dna induces synthesis of prospective suppressive factors (e.g., suppressor of cytokine signaling [socs]), the effects  of p. gingivalis dna and gtf exposure on rat splenocyte production of socs family molecules and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in vitro. p. gingivalis dna significantly up-regulated socs1 and socs5 expression and down-regulated interleukin-10 expression by cultured splenocytes. these results suggested that dna from periodontal disease-associated bacteria did not enhance, but in fact suppressed, the immune response to a protein antigen from cariogenic streptococci, potentially through suppressive socs components triggered by innate mechanisms.

TI  == infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. material and methods: clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, sd+/-1.5). forty species were identified by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. neisseria mucosa, fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, p<0.05), the levels of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, p<0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, p<0.05), and micromonas micros (r=0.17, p=0.01). e. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (p<0.05). subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (p<0.02) and n. mucosa (p<0.05). independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of p. gingivalis (p<0.05), and leptotrichia buccalis (p<0.05). conclusions: at implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.

TI  == activation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by gram-negative periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease associated with a  gram-negative subgingival microflora. bacterial components stimulate, among other receptors, toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and/or tlr4. accumulating evidence indicates that both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses result from the triggering of tlr2 as compared to tlr4 triggering. the aim was to study the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum and veillonella parvula with tlr2 and tlr4. we investigated all known serotypes (k(-), k1-k6) of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a-e strains for their potency to stimulate cytokine production. methods: human embryonic kidney (hek) cells, stably transfected with cd14, cd14-tlr2, or cd14-tlr4 and whole blood were stimulated with bacterial sonicates. cytokine production (interleukin-6, -8, -10 and -12) was measured in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all test bacteria stimulated hek-cd14-tlr2, but only a. actinomycetemcomitans and v. parvula stimulated hek-cd14-tlr4. no differences were found in the activation  of hek-cd14-tlr2/4, or cytokine production in whole blood between serotypes of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: gram-negative periodontal bacteria predominantly stimulated tlr2, which may be of importance for the th1/th2 cell orientation of the immune response in periodontitis.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

AB  == background: the outcome of microbiological diagnostics may depend on the sampling technique. it was the aim of the present study to compare two widely used sampling techniques for subgingival bacteria using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. methods: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. in group a, samples were taken first with a paper point and then with a curet at the same site (single-rooted teeth with probing depth >5 mm) before scaling and root planing and after 10 weeks. the sampling sequence was reversed in group b. the analysis enabled the quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythensis and total bacterial counts (tbcs). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman correlation. results: higher tbc was harvested with curets than by paper points (p = 0.008). the plaque composition with regard to total target pathogens was similar for both sampling techniques. a strong positive correlation was found between curet and paper point samples for tbc and single target bacteria. conclusions: overall, there was a relatively good agreement for the results of paper point and curet sampling. thus, both techniques seem to be suitable for microbiological diagnostics.

TI  == evidence of periopathogenic microorganisms in placentas of women with preeclampsia.
AB  == background: periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory infectious disease that may act as a focus of infection. preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific hypertensive disorder that often leads to maternal morbidity and mortality. acute atherosis, the placental lesion of preeclampsia, shares many histopathological features with atherosclerosis. recently, chronic infection was linked to the initiation of atherosclerosis. oral pathogens have been detected in atherosclerotic plaques, where they may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. the purpose of the present study was to explore the possibility that periopathogenic bacteria may translocate into the placental  tissues of women with preeclampsia. methods: samples were taken from 16 placentas obtained from cesarean sections of women with preeclampsia and from 14 age-matched healthy pregnant women. polymerase chain reaction was used to detect  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola. results: eight of the 16 (50%) placenta specimens were positive for one or more periopathogenic bacteria in the preeclampsia group, compared to only  two of the 14 samples (14.3%) from controls. bacterial counts were statistically  significantly higher in the preeclampsia group for all of the periopathogenic bacteria examined (p <or=0.0055). although all of the target periopathogenic bacteria were found in the preeclampsia group, only three (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola) were found in the control group. conclusion: the  significant presence of periopathogenic microorganisms or their products in human placentas of women with preeclampsia may suggest a possible contribution of periopathogenic bacteria to the pathogenesis of this syndrome.

TI  == signaling cascades triggered by bacterial metabolic end products during reactivation of kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.
AB  == the present studies explore the role of polymicrobial infection in the reactivation of kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) and analyze signaling pathways activated upon this induction. we hypothesized that activation of the cellular stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) p38 pathway would play a key role in the bacterium-mediated disruption of viral latency similar to that of previously reported results obtained with other inducers of gammaherpesvirus lytic replication. kshv within infected bcbl-1 cells was induced to replicate following exposure to metabolic end products from gram-negative or -positive bacteria that were then simultaneously exposed to specific inhibitors of signal transduction pathways. we have determined that bacterium-mediated induction of lytic kshv infection is significantly reduced by  the inhibition of the p38 mapk pathway. in contrast, inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway did not impair induction of lytic replication or p38 phosphorylation. protein kinase c, though activated, was not the major pathway used for bacterium-induced viral reactivation. furthermore, hyperacetylation of histones 3 and 4 was detected. collectively, our results show that metabolic end products from these pathogens induce lytic replication of kshv in bcbl-1 cells primarily via the activation of a stress-activated mapk pathway.  importantly, we demonstrate for the first time a mechanism by which polymicrobial bacterial infections result in kshv reactivation and pathogenesis.

TI  == differential activation of nf-kappab and gene expression in oral epithelial cells by periodontal pathogens.
AB  == to investigate the molecular effects of the periodontopathogens fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) on the oral epithelium, the h400 oral epithelial cell line was cultured in the presence of non-viable bacteria. following confirmation of the presence of transcripts for the bacterial pattern recognition receptors in h400 cells, toll-like receptors -2, -4 and -9, and components of the nf-kappab signalling pathway, immunocytochemical analyses were  performed showing that nf-kappab was activated within 1 h of exposure to both periodontopathogens. a significantly greater number of nf-kappab nuclear translocations were apparent following h400 cell exposure to fn as compared with  pg. gene expression analyses indicated that transcripts known to be regulated by  the nf-kappab pathway, including cytokines/chemokines tnf-alpha, il-1beta, il-8,  mcp-1/ccl2 and gm-csf, were up-regulated following 4 and 24 h of exposure to both periodontopathogens. in addition, h400 periodontopathogen exposure resulted in differential regulation of transcripts for several cytokeratin gene family members. consistent with the immunocytochemical data, microarray results indicated that fn induced a greater number of gene expression changes than pg following 24 h of exposure, 609 and 409 genes, respectively. ninety-one genes were commonly differentially expressed by both periodontopathogens and represented biological processes commonly associated with periodontitis. gene expression analyses by reserve transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) of molecules identified from the microarray data sets, including heme oxygenase-1, lysyl oxidase, sod2, ccl20 and calprotectin components, confirmed their differential expression profiles induced by the two periodontopathogens. fn and pg have clearly different molecular effects on oral epithelial cells, potentially highlighting the importance of the composition of the plaque biofilm  in periodontitis pathogenesis.

TI  == gingival epithelial cell transcriptional responses to commensal and opportunistic oral microbial species.
AB  == transcriptional profiling and ontology tools were utilized to define the biological pathways of gingival epithelial cells modulated by coculture with the  oral commensal streptococcus gordonii and the opportunistic commensal fusobacterium nucleatum. overall, f. nucleatum and s. gordonii perturbed the gingival epithelial cell transcriptome much less significantly than the oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans perturbed the transcriptome, indicating that there was a greater degree of host adaptation by the commensal species (m. handfield, j. j. mans, g. zheng, m. c. lopez, s. mao, a. progulske-fox, g. narasimhan, h. v. baker, and r. j. lamont, cell. microbiol. 7:811-823, 2005). the biological pathways significantly impacted by f. nucleatum and s. gordonii included the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and toll-like receptor signaling pathways. differential regulation of gadd45 and dusp4, key components of the mapk pathway, was confirmed at the protein level by western blotting. modulation of the mapk pathway is likely to affect host cell proliferation and differentiation. in addition, both the mapk and toll-like receptor pathways ultimately converge on cytokine gene expression.  an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of secreted interleukin-6 (il-6) and il-8 demonstrated that f. nucleatum induced production of these cytokines, whereas s.  gordonii inhibited secretion from the epithelial cells. stimulation of secretion  of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cells may reflect the invasive phenotype of f. nucleatum and contribute to the greater pathogenic potential of f. nucleatum than of s. gordonii.

AB  == fibroblasts, a major constituent of gingival connective tissue, can produce immunoregulatory cytokines and proteolytic enzymes that may contribute to tissue  destruction. in this study, we evaluated the production of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), tissue inhibitors of mmps (timps), and plasminogen activators by gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) produced by periodontopathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.  in addition, changes in the expression and phosphorylation state of fibroblast intracellular signaling proteins induced by a. actinomycetemcomitans lps were characterized using antibody microarrays. we showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps induced the production of a 50 kda plasminogen activator, mmp-2 and, to a lesser extent, mmp-3 by fibroblasts. the stimulation of fibroblasts with a. actinomycetemcomitans lps also resulted in the overproduction of timp-1, but had  no effect on the production of timp-2. comparable responses were also obtained with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum lps. the results of the microarray analyses showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps induced changes in the phosphorylation state and expression of gingival fibroblast intracellular signaling proteins. more specifically, they suggested that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps may induce both jun n-terminus protein-serine kinases (jnk) and mitogen-activated protein-serine kinase p38 alpha (p38alpha mapk) pathway activation, leading to increased activator protein-1 (ap-1) and nuclear factor kappa-b (nfkappab) activities, which in turn can stimulate mmp-2,  mmp-3, timp-1, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (upa) expression. this may contribute to periodontal connective tissue destruction.

TI  == interleukin-1alpha stimulation in monocytes by periodontal bacteria: antagonistic effects of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontal pathogenic bacteria are associated with elevated levels of interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha) but it is unclear if all species can induce cytokine production equally. porphyromonas gingivalis may be able antagonize il-1alpha induced by other species through the activity of its proteases or lipopolysaccharide (lps). monomac-6 cells and primary human monocytes were treated with culture supernatants from porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedius, veillonella atypical and prevotella nigrescens. il-1alpha protein levels were measured after 6 h of incubation. in addition, monocytes were co-stimulated with supernatants from p. gingivalis and other bacteria. the role of p. gingivalis proteases was tested using arg-x and lys-x mutant strains. the role of lps was investigated using purified p. gingivalis lps and polymixin depletion. all species tested induced significant il-1alpha production, but p. gingivalis was the weakest. co-stimulation of monocytes with p. gingivalis antagonized the ability of other bacterial species to induce il-1alpha production. this effect was at its greatest with c. rectus (resulting in a 70% reduction). gingipain mutant strains and chemical inhibition of protease activity did not reduce antagonistic activity. however, 100 ng/ml of p. gingivalis lps can reproduce the antagonistic activity of p. gingivalis culture supernatants. periodontitis-associated bacterial species stimulate il-1alpha production by monocytes. p. gingivalis can antagonize this effect, and its lps appears to be the crucial component. this study highlights the importance of mixed infections in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease because reduction of pro-inflammatory  cytokine levels may impair the ability of the host to tackle infection.

TI  == sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  == aim: to explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (uv) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. methodology: the sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to uv light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm uv, at a fluence of 1-20 mj cm(-2). an experimental model was  designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of uv light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. results: direct exposure to relatively low doses of uv light (2-7 mj cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. furthermore, an enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to uv light (p < 0.001). uv was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. when 4 bacterial  cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the uv light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. conclusions: the application of uv light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the uv light dose adapted accordingly.

TI  == inflammation associated with implants with different surface types.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate associated with different transmucosal implant surfaces in dogs. methods: three experimental and one control single-stage implants were randomly placed on each side of the jaw in eight dogs. the transmucosal portion of the test implants consisted of an acid-etched surface (type a), a machined surface with a circumferential groove (type c) and a surface prepared by mild anodic oxidation (type d). the control was a standard machined surface (type b). in order to determine the response to the different surfaces, plaque control was carried out twice weekly following placement of the implants for the entire period of the experiment. at 6 months, gingival biopsies and plaque samples were  obtained. the area of inflammatory infiltrate and the nature of the infiltrating  cell types were determined using immunohistology. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to identify putative periodontal pathogens. results: inflammatory infiltrates were associated with all implant surfaces and were commonly found subepithelially and perivascularly. t cells were the predominant infiltrating cell type in all lesions, associated with the different surfaces. in all lesions the cd4 : cd8 ratio was approximately 2 : 1. statistical analysis showed that the type c surface (machined surface with a groove) had significantly larger inflammatory infiltrates than the type b surface (machined surface without a groove; p<0.05). no statistically significant differences were found with respect to the size of the inflammatory infiltrates or in terms of the nature of  infiltrating cells. however, despite the intensive plaque control regime, plaque  was present on all implant surfaces at the time of biopsy 6 months after placement. all implants had similar numbers of tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, was not detected in any sample. conclusions: these results suggest that the development of inflammation associated with implants is independent of surface type, but is nevertheless associated with the presence of  plaque. the different surfaces had no influence on the nature of the infiltrate,  with t cells being the predominant cell type in all lesions. finally, the different implant surface types seemed not to influence the peri-implant microbiota. however, the presence of the circumferential groove tended to be associated with larger infiltrates. whether this is due to increased plaque accumulation remains to be determined.

TI  == rat model of polymicrobial infection, immunity, and alveolar bone resorption in periodontal disease.
AB  == one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans is expressed clinically as periodontal disease. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly implicated as members of a pathogenic consortium in the etiology of adult periodontitis. in this study we hypothesized  that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia are synergistic in terms of virulence potential and induce chronic periodontal inflammation that leads to alveolar bone resorption in a polymicrobial infection in rats. groups of rats were infected with either p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia in monomicrobial infections or with all three species in polymicrobial oral infections with or without fusobacterium nucleatum. pcr analyses of oral microbial samples demonstrated that rats infected with one bacterium were orally  colonized by each of the bacteria during the study interval, and increased serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody levels substantiated the interaction of the host  with the infecting bacteria. pcr analyses of the rats with polymicrobial infections demonstrated that most rats were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a consortium. furthermore, all rats exhibited a significant increase in the level of igg antibody to the polymicrobial consortium. radiographic measurement of alveolar bone resorption showed that rats infected with the polymicrobial consortium with or without f. nucleatum exhibited significantly increased alveolar bone resorption compared to the resorption in uninfected control rats, as well as the resorption in rats infected with one of the microbes. these results documented that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia not only exist as a consortium that is associated with chronic periodontitis but also exhibit synergistic virulence resulting in the immunoinflammatory bone resorption characteristic of periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological profiles of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seropositive brazilians undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy and hiv-seronegative brazilians with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: this study compares the periodontal clinical profile and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seropositive and hiv-seronegative subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 172 subjects were distributed into two hiv-seropositive groups (37 chronic periodontitis [h+cp+] and 35 periodontally healthy [h+cp-] individuals) and two hiv-seronegative groups (49 chronic periodontitis [h-cp+] and 51 periodontally healthy [h-cp-] subjects). subgingival samples were collected from six sites with the deepest probing depth in the periodontitis groups and six random sites in the groups with periodontal health. all hiv-infected patients had undergone highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart)  for at least 2 years. the presence and levels of 33 bacterial species were detected by dna probes and the checkerboard method. kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney tests were used to seek for significant differences among and between groups. results: h-cp+ patients showed significantly more periodontal destruction and inflammation than h+cp+ patients, whereas h+cp- subjects presented a greater percentage of sites with bleeding than h-cp- subjects (p <0.01). patients who were hiv seronegative showed higher prevalence and levels of most bacterial species than hiv seropositive patients. periodontal pathogens including tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas noxia were more frequently detected in h-cp+ subjects compared to h+cp+ and controls. in contrast, enterococcus faecalis and acinetobacter baumannii were more commonly found in hiv-infected than in non-hiv-infected subjects (p <0.05). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens are more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of hiv-seronegative patients with chronic periodontitis, whereas species not usually associated with periodontitis are detected in higher frequency in hiv-seropositive subjects under haart.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == background: salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. the biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate  the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. methods: six common oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646, porphyromonas gingivalis  atcc 33277, capnocytophaga gingivalis atcc 33624, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, and candida albicans atcc 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/l. all of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. the optical densities (od) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. results: nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/l  had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low ph values. the antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low ph values. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the  tested pathogens. conclusion: nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human  saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on  these organisms.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine against  selected single-species biofilms.
AB  == aim: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 2.5% and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 2.0% chlorhexidine gel and liquid as endodontic-irrigating substances against selected single-species biofilms. methods: single-species biofilms of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis and fusobacterium nucleatum were generated on a cellulose nitrate membrane placed on  agar medium. the biofilms were then immersed in the endodontic-irrigating substances for 30 s and also for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, with and without mechanical agitation. sterile saline was used as control. after each time period, the membrane filters were then transferred to tubes containing 2 ml of fresh broth medium plus neutralizers (in order to prevent the residual action of the tested substances). the micro-organisms were suspended using a vortex, and the inoculum was serially diluted 10-fold. aliquots of the dilutions were plated on 5% sheep blood agar medium, and incubated under adequate gaseous conditions. colony-forming units were calculated. the samples were compared using the friedman and tukey test, when necessary, at a significance level of p < 0.05. results: mechanical agitation promoted the effectiveness of the antimicrobial agents, resulting in less time to eliminate the same micro-organisms, except for  s. aureus with 2.5% naocl. antimicrobial agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine, killed the tested micro-organisms more rapidly. saline did not inhibit the growth of any of the tested micro-organisms, with or without agitation, being statistically different (p < 0.05) from naocl and chlorhexidine. p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were eliminated in 30 s by all antimicrobial agents, with our without agitation, in contrast with the facultative and aerobe strains. conclusions: mechanical agitation improved the antimicrobial properties of the chemical substances tested using a biofilm model, favouring the agents in liquid  presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine.

AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the effects of photodynamic therapy (pdt) on endodontic pathogens in planktonic phase as well as on enterococcus faecalis biofilms in experimentally infected root canals of extracted teeth. strains of microorganisms were sensitized with methylene blue (25 microg/ml) for  5 minutes followed by exposure to red light of 665 nm with an energy fluence of 30 j/cm2. methylene blue fully eliminated all bacterial species with the exception of e. faecalis (53% killing). the same concentration of methylene blue  in combination with red light (222 j/cm2) was able to eliminate 97% of e. faecalis biofilm bacteria in root canals using an optical fiber with multiple cylindrical diffusers that uniformly distributed light at 360 degrees. we conclude that pdt may be developed as an adjunctive procedure to kill residual bacteria in the root canal system after standard endodontic treatment.

TI  == antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria.
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. tap water was electrolyzed in a water vessel  using platinum cell technology. the electrolyzed tap water (called puri-water) was put in contact with five major periodontopathogens or toothbrushes contaminated with these bacteria for 30 sec. in addition, puri-water was used as  a mouthwash for 30 sec in 16 subjects and the antibacterial effect on salivary bacteria was evaluated. puri-water significantly reduced the growth of all periodontopathogens in culture and on toothbrushes, and that of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in saliva, when compared to the effect of tap water. it also significantly reduced mutans streptococci growing on mitis salivarius-bacitracin  agar. our results demonstrate that the electrolyzed tap water is effective as a mouthwash and for toothbrush disinfection.

AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

AB  == background: inflammation is a significant component of atherosclerosis lesions. bacteria, including periodontopathogens, have been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques and cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial  groel with human heat shock protein 60 has been suggested as a link between infections and atherosclerosis. methods: in this study, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and the presence of human heat shock protein 60 and groel were examined in 31 carotid endarterectomy specimens. additionally, monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the presence of six bacteria, including those implicated in periodontal disease. results: the inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lesions was dominated by cd14(+) macrophages and cd4(+) t cells. most cells of the infiltrate as well as the endothelium were hla-dr(+), indicating activation; however, there was an absence of cd25 expression, demonstrating that  the activated t cells were not proliferating. few cd1a(+) and cd83(+) cells were  noted. human heat shock protein 60 expression was evident on endothelial cells and cells with the appearance of smooth muscle cells and lymphocytes. groel and bacteria were detected within intimal cells. chlamydia pneumoniae, porphyromonas  gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found in 21%, 52%, 34%, 34%, 41%, and 17% of arteries, respectively. conclusion: these results give evidence for a  specific immune response associated with atherosclerosis. whether bacteria initiate the observed inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions is not clear; however, the present study shows that maintenance of inflammation may be enhanced by the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial barrier of an in vitro oral epithelial model.
AB  == objective: oral epithelia function as a microbial barrier and are actively involved in recognizing and responding to bacteria. our goal was to examine a tissue engineered model of buccal epithelium for its response to oral bacteria and proinflammatory cytokines and compare the tissue responses with those of a submerged monolayer cell culture. design: the tissue model was characterized for  keratin and beta-defensin expression. altered expression of beta-defensins was evaluated by rt-pcr after exposure of the apical surface to oral bacteria and after exposure to tnf-alpha in the medium. these were compared to the response in traditional submerged oral epithelial cell culture. results: the buccal model showed expression of differentiation specific keratin 13, hbd1 and hbd3 in the upper half of the tissue; hbd2 was not detected. hbd1 mrna was constitutively expressed, while hbd2 mrna increased 2-fold after exposure of the apical surface  to three oral bacteria tested and hbd3 mrna increased in response to the non-pathogenic bacteria tested. in contrast, hbd2 mrna increased 3-600-fold in response to bacteria in submerged cell culture. hbd2 mrna increased over 100-fold in response to tnf-alpha in the tissue model and 50-fold in submerged cell culture. thus, the tissue model is capable of upregulating hbd2, however, the minimal response to bacteria suggests that the tissue has an effective antimicrobial barrier due to its morphology, differentiation, and defensin expression. conclusions: the oral mucosal model is differentiated, expresses hbd1 and hbd3, and has an intact surface with a functional antimicrobial barrier.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of oral bacteria  on the dorsum of the tongue. in addition, the relationship between the number of  teeth and the microflora present on the coating of the tongue in a population of  85-year-old people was assessed. subjects and methods: two hundred and five individuals (89 males, 116 females) from the same geographical area who were 85 years of age were examined. five periodontopathic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola) and one cariogenic bacterium (streptococcus mutans) were analysed using a polymerase chain reaction assay of tongue samples from the population. results: periodontal bacteria-positive individuals have more teeth than that of periodontal bacteria-negative people. between the periodontal bacteria-positive and -negative individuals, there were significant differences in the mean number of teeth for p. gingivalis (p<0.0001), t. denticola (p<0.001), f. nucleatum (p=0.002), and t. forsythia (p=0.005), while there were no significant differences for a. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.998) or s. mutans (p=0.147). conclusions: a wide range of species, including anaerobes, was detected in 85-year-old subjects. it was found that the detection of periodontal bacteria on the tongue coating increased with the number of teeth. there was a positive relationship between the tooth number and periodontopathic bacteria, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that tongue  care is essential for preventing oral disease and needs to be part of any oral care programme in elderly people.

TI  == antimicrobial effect in vitro of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide impregnated  gutta-percha points.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of points containing antiseptics used for temporary obturation in endodontics. points containing calcium hydroxide (roeko and hygienic), and chlorhexidine (roeko) were tested and gutta-percha points served as control (meta dental corp.). the following microorganisms were studied: streptococcus mutans (sm), enterococcus faecalis (ef), staphylococcus aureus (sta), candida albicans (ca), fusobacterium  nucleatum (fn) atcc 25586, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) atcc 33277, and prevotella intermedia (pi) atcc 25611. the experiments were organized in three stages: 1st stage: one point of each kind was placed on agar plates previously seeded with microorganisms. 2nd stage: another group of points was immersed in broth for 24 hours and placed on the seeded agar. samples were then incubated at  37 degrees in the conditions of oxygen and for the time required by each microorganism. the zones of bacterial inhibition around each point were measured. the ph values of the broths were recorded. 3rd stage: the immersion broths were inoculated with suspensions of microorganisms, incubated, seeded on plates by dissemination and incubated. cfu counts were performed. results: points containing chlorhexidine showed inhibition zones with every microorganism in the  1st stage and, in the 2nd stage, with most of the microorganisms studied, except  for fn and pi. calcium hydroxide containing points did not inhibit any of the microorganisms assessed. broth ph values did not exhibit any changes. cfu counts  of the broths in which chlorhexidine points had been immersed showed total inhibition for all the microorganisms. the differences between materials were statistically significant (p<0.05) (anova). in the conditions of this study, chlorhexidine-containing points proved to be effective against most of the tested strains.

TI  == supragingival plaque may modify the effects of subgingival bacteria on attachment loss.
AB  == background: bacterial interactions in response to local and systemic factors may  explain important features of the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. this study evaluates the role of supragingival plaque level on the relationship between subgingival microorganisms and the risk of attachment loss. methods: the study population consisted of 386 white women aged 45 years and older who had at least  seven teeth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesio-buccal surface  of six maxillary and six mandibular teeth using paper point technique. the samples were pooled, and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to identify  the following target microorganisms: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythensis (tf), campylobacter rectus (cr), prevotella intermedia (pi), capnocytophaga species (cs), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), eubacterium saburreum (es), and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). the presence or absence of supragingival plaque and clinical attachment loss (cal) were assessed at the same 12 sites where subgingival plaque samples were taken. the association of each microorganism with cal was tested using multiple logistic regressions controlling for age, smoking status, and diabetes. odds ratios (or) and their 95% confidence  intervals (ci) were calculated. results: at low supragingival plaque levels, only the presence of pg was significantly associated with cal (or: 6.41, 95% ci: 1.30  to 31.70); all remaining microorganisms were also associated with increased but non-significant risk of cal. at high supragingival plaque levels, the presence of tf (or: 2.40, 95% ci: 1.42 to 4.04) and pg (or: 3.71, 95% ci: 1.63 to 8.42) was significantly associated with increased risk of attachment loss. by contrast, the presence of cs (or: 0.55, 95% ci: 0.30 to 1.01) and es (or: 0.35, 95% ci: 0.15 to 0.82) was associated with decreased risk of attachment loss. fn, pi, and cr were  not significantly associated with cal at either low or high supragingival plaque  levels. conclusions: this study suggests that the association of certain subgingival microorganisms with cal changes in relation to supragingival plaque levels in older adult women. it also suggests that the overall effect of dental plaque is a function of the balance between pathogenic and other microorganisms that colonize this environment. therefore, all microorganisms in the biofilm, including those with no apparent association with overt disease and those with negative associations, may play roles in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == inhibitory effects of macrocarpals on the biological activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: macrocarpals, which are phloroglucinol derivatives contained in  eucalyptus leaves, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria including oral bacteria. this study examined effects of macrocarpals a, b, and c  on periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: macrocarpals a, b, and c were purified from a 60% ethanol-extract of eucalyptus globules leaves. to investigate antibacterial activity, representative periodontopathic bacteria were cultured in media with or without various amounts  of macrocarpals; subsequently, the optical density at 660 nm was measured. macrocarpal inhibition of p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases was assessed by spectrofluorophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. the effect of macrocarpals on p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was examined with  (3)h-labeled p. gingivalis. results: growth of p. gingivalis was inhibited more strongly than growth of prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola by macrocarpals, however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum were much more resistant. macrocarpals inhibited p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases in a dose-dependent manner. the enzyme-inhibitory effect of macrocarpals was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in which hemoglobin degradation by p. gingivalis proteinase was inhibited by macrocarpals. p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was also strongly attenuated by macrocarpals. conclusions: macrocarpals a, b and c demonstrated antibacterial activity against periodontopathic bacteria. among tested bacteria,  p. gingivalis displayed the greatest sensitivity to macrocarpals; additionally, its trypsin-like proteinase activity and binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  beads were inhibited by macrocarpals. these results indicate that eucalyptus leaf extracts may be useful as a potent preventative of periodontal disease.

TI  == analysis of the antibacterial activity and plaque control benefit of colgate total dentifrice via clinical evaluation and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == objective: this study analyzed, from a combined clinical and molecular biologic perspective, the antibacterial and antiplaque efficacy of colgate total dentifrice (ctd). methodology: a single-blind crossover study design utilized 11  healthy human subjects. after a one-week washout period, subjects donated dental  plaque, received a dental prophylaxis, and subsequently brushed with a test product. twenty-four hours postbrushing, dental plaque was collected and a clinical plaque score determined. dental plaque was submitted for real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) analysis. the same procedure was repeated in accordance with a crossover design for the use of the second test product. following a one-week washout, a plaque donation, prophylaxis, and brushing with the test product ensued for each subject. twenty-four hours post-brushing, the subjects returned for a plaque score and plaque donation. results: twenty-four hours after brushing, dental plaque coverage increased 17.88% +/- 8.27% with ctd, compared to 30.42% +/- 9.97% with colgate cavity protection (ccp; p = 0.005). real-time pcr found plaque collected 24 hours after  brushing with ctd exhibited, on average, fewer representative periodontal pathogens (fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, and porphyromonas gingivalis) and fewer early colonizers (actinomyces naeslundii) than plaque collected before brushing, whereas ccp showed a moderate effect on oral bacteria. conclusion: the study provides clinical and molecular biological evidence to substantiate the antibacterial and  plaque control benefits of colgate total, and suggests the value of combining a molecular biological method with clinical research to corroborate clinical benefits.

TI  == coaggregation of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum pk 1594 is  mediated by capsular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == previous reports have shown that coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, two important periodontopathogens, is mediated by a  galactoside on the surface of p. gingivalis and a lectin on f. nucleatum. in the  present study, purified capsular polysaccharide (cps) and lipopolysaccharide (lps) of p. gingivalis pk 1924 (serotype k5) were found to be able to bind to f.  nucleatum cells and to inhibit binding of f. nucleatum to p. gingivalis serotype  k5. sugar binding studies showed that the requirements for binding of p. gingivalis serotype k5 cps and lps to the f. nucleatum lectin are: the presence of a metal divalent ion, an axial free hydroxyl group at position 4 and free equatorial hydroxyl groups at position 3 and 6 of d-galactose. these data suggest that p. gingivalis serotype k5- cps and lps act as receptors mediating coaggregation between p. gingivalis and fusobacteria.

TI  == anti-inflammatory activity of a high-molecular-weight cranberry fraction on macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting oral tissues. the continuous, high production of cytokines by host cells triggered by periodontopathogens is thought to be responsible for the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. macrophages play a critical role in this host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialyzable material prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharides (lps) from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and escherichia coli. interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta), il-6, il-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and regulated on activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted (rantes) production by macrophages treated with the cranberry fraction prior to stimulation by lps was evaluated by elisa. our results clearly indicate that the cranberry fraction was  a potent inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses induced by lps. this suggests that cranberry constituents may offer perspectives  for the development of a new therapeutic approach to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein vaccine reduces the alveolar bone loss induced by multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: heat shock protein (hsp) can be utilized as a vaccine to cross-protect against multiple pathogenic species. the present study was performed to evaluate porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) as a vaccine candidate to inhibit multiple bacteria-induced alveolar bone loss. material and methods: recombinant p. gingivalis hsp60 was produced and purified from p. gingivalis groel gene. rats were immunized with p. gingivalis hsp60, and  experimental alveolar bone loss was induced by infection with multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria. results: there was a very strong inverse relationship between postimmune anti-p. gingivalis hsp immunoglobulin g (igg) levels and the amount of alveolar bone loss induced by either p. gingivalis or multiple bacterial infection (p=0.007). polymerase chain reaction data indicated  that the vaccine successfully eradicated the multiple pathogenic species. conclusions: we concluded that p. gingivalis hsp60 could potentially be developed as a vaccine to inhibit periodontal disease induced by multiple pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == objective: to investigate (1) reduction in the number of microorganisms obtained  directly after subgingival instrumentation, (2) rate of bacterial re-colonization during 2 weeks, under supragingival plaque-free conditions. materials and methods: effects of subgingival instrumentation were measured at one deep pocket  in 22 patients (11 smokers and 11 non-smokers). immediately after initial therapy, experimental sites, under strict plaque control, were instrumented subgingivally. microbiological evaluation was performed at pre-instrumentation, immediate post-instrumentation and 1 and 2 weeks post-instrumentation. results: mean total anaerobic colony forming units (cfus) dropped from 3.9 x 10(6) before  to 0.09 x 10(6) immediately following instrumentation. significant reductions were found for tannerella forsythia, micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and spirochetes. significant reductions were not observed for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus. except for spirochetes, no reduction in prevalence of specific periodontal bacteria was found immediately after instrumentation. during follow-up, mean total cfu tended to increase. prevalence of periodontal bacteria  further reduced. no effect of smoking was found. conclusion: results indicate that subgingival mechanical cleaning in itself, has a limited effect, in actually removing bacteria. the subsequent reduction in prevalence of specific periodontal bacteria shows that it is apparently difficult for these species to survive in treated pockets.

TI  == identification and localization of extraradicular biofilm-forming bacteria associated with refractory endodontic pathogens.
AB  == bacterial biofilms have been found to develop on root surfaces outside the apical foramen and be associated with refractory periapical periodontitis. however, it is unknown which bacterial species form extraradicular biofilms. the present study aimed to investigate the identity and localization of bacteria in human extraradicular biofilms. twenty extraradicular biofilms, used to identify bacteria using a pcr-based 16s rrna gene assay, and seven root-tips, used to observe immunohistochemical localization of three selected bacterial species, were taken from 27 patients with refractory periapical periodontitis. bacterial dna was detected from 14 of the 20 samples, and 113 bacterial species were isolated. fusobacterium nucleatum (14 of 14), porphyromonas gingivalis (12 of 14), and tannellera forsythensis (8 of 14) were frequently detected. unidentified and uncultured bacterial dna was also detected in 11 of the 14 samples in which dna was detected. in the biofilms, p. gingivalis was immunohistochemically detected in all parts of the extraradicular biofilms. positive reactions to anti-f. nucleatum and anti-t. forsythensis sera were found at specific portions of the biofilm. these findings suggested that p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and f. nucleatum were associated with extraradicular biofilm formation and refractory periapical periodontitis.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == cross-reactivity of groel antibodies with human heat shock protein 60 and quantification of pathogens in atherosclerosis.
AB  == background/aims: chronic infections such as those caused by chlamydia pneumoniae  and periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis have been associated with atherosclerosis, possibly due to cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial groel with human heat shock protein (hhsp) 60. methods: we  examined the cross-reactivity of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies with hhsp60 in atherosclerosis patients and quantified a panel of six pathogens in atheromas. results: after absorption of plasma samples with hhsp60, there were variable reductions in the levels of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies, suggesting that these antibodies cross-reacted with hhsp60. all of the artery specimens were positive for p. gingivalis. fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, c. pneumoniae, helicobacter pylori, and haemophilus influenzae were found in 84%, 48%, 28%, 4%, and 4% of arteries, respectively. the prevalence of the three periodontopathic microorganisms, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, was significantly higher than that of the remaining three microorganisms. conclusions: these results support the hypothesis that in some patients, cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial hsps including those of periodontal pathogens, with arterial endothelial cells expressing hhsp60 may be a possible mechanism for the association between atherosclerosis and periodontal infection.

TI  == the effects of intra-amniotic injection of periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides in sheep.
AB  == objective: periodontal disease may cause several complications of pregnancy, including fetal death. the purpose of this study was to investigate in sheep the  effects of the intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide from 3 periodontopathic organisms and to compare these effects with those resulting from similar injection of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. the outcomes that were  studied included the rates of fetal death and the features of inflammation and lung maturation in survivors. study design: at 118 days of pregnancy, ewes that were bearing single fetuses were allocated at random to receive intra-amniotic injections of saline solution (n = 13 fetuses), or lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis (in doses from 0.1 to 10 mg [n = 22 fetuses]), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 6 fetuses]), fusobacterium nucleatum (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]) or escherichia coli (10 mg [n = 14 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 7 fetuses]). surviving fetuses were delivered  abdominally at 125 days of gestation (term, 150 days). results: when compared with escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at similar dosages, periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides had high rates of fetal lethality. only 6 of 22 fetuses that  were exposed to intra-amniotic porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide survived doses of 0.1 to 10 mg, and only 3 of 6 fetuses survived 10-mg actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide. escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide did not cause fetal loss when given at doses of 10 mg (n = 14  fetuses) or 1 mg (n = 7 fetuses). fetuses that survived exposure to these lipopolysaccharides showed features of inflammation in amniotic fluid and cord blood at birth and enhanced lung maturation. conclusion: lipopolysaccharides from these 3 periodontopathic organisms have much higher rates of fetal lethality than escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide but can cause similar intrauterine inflammatory responses and improvements in lung volumes in survivors. sources of  inflammation that are distant from the uterus may underlie a proportion of unexplained stillbirth and other complications of pregnancy.

AB  == aims: erythromycin (ery) and spiramycin (spi) are the most frequently prescribed  macrolides by dentists. however, the emergence of resistant anaerobic subgingival bacteria imposes an increased vigilance. this study aims to compare these macrolides efficacy on principal periopathogens. materials and methods: twenty adult patients with aggressive periodontitis were selected and a total of 60 samples were taken from subgingival flora. bacterial strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were isolated  according to j. slots's rapid identification method. the susceptibilities to ery  and spi were studied using disk diffusion susceptibility test and minimum inhibitory concentration test (mic test). results: the efficiency variability of  ery and spi on the 50 isolated anaerobic periopathogens was present either interindividually (between different patients) and intra-individually (within the same patient). while 68% of the tested anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to spi (22% resistant), only 54% were sensitive to ery (34% resistant). although moderate, the efficacy of spi seemed more regular in general than ery: it's variation coefficient (40%) is lower than the ery one (53%). the 7 a. actinomycetemcomitans tested showed all a high resistance. conclusion: in a general way, the spectre of activity of spi is stacked in that of ery. however, this study shows a better and regular activity of spi on the main tested periopathogens. these results are in favour of the use of spi in periodontology when penicillins and doxycycline are not useful because specific problems are identified (allergy, pregnancy...).

TI  == efficacy of photodynamic therapy on inflammatory signs and two selected periodontopathogenic species in a beagle dog model.
AB  == background: current research aims to find alternatives to conventional methods for suppressing periodontopathogenic bacteria. photodynamic therapy (pdt) could be a suitable treatment procedure of periodontal infections. methods: in the present study, the pdt method was tested with two photosensitizers, chlorine e6 and blc1010, in an experiment on beagle dogs. the animals were infected with porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) in all subgingival areas. after infection, we observed clinical signs of gingival inflammation, including an increase of redness and bleeding on probing. microbiological monitoring before and after treatment was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). pdt was conducted with a diode laser with a wavelength of 662 nm  using a power of 0.5 w and the photosensitizers. results: the pdt procedure carried out with either of the photosensitizers caused a significant reduction in the clinical inflammation signs of redness and bop, compared to the controls (laser only and no treatment). furthermore, pdt with chlorine e6 caused a significant reduction in p. gingivalis-infected sites, whereas there was a lack in suppression after pdt with blc1010. f. nucleatum could hardly be reduced with  chlorine e6, and only to a certain extent with blc 1010 and laser only. in the control groups, the pg-infected test sites did not change. conclusions: this study demonstrated that the photodynamic therapy using photosensitizer and a 662  nm laser light source is distinctly advantageous in reducing the periodontal signs of redness and bleeding on probing. the procedure also appears to significantly suppress p. gingivalis.

AB  == background and aim: antimicrobial resistance of periodontal pathogens towards currently used antibiotics in periodontics has been investigated in a previous study. microbial resistance in the periodontal microflora was more frequently observed in spanish patients in comparison with dutch patients. the aim of the present study was to compare antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of five periodontal bacteria isolated from periodontitis patients in spain and in the netherlands. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from adult patients with periodontitis were collected and cultured on selective and non-selective plates. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and micromonas micros were isolated and used for minimal inhibitory concentration tests using the epsilometer (e-test) technique. eight different antibiotics were tested on all bacterial isolates. mic50 and mic90 values for each antibiotic and each species were determined and the percentage of resistant strains was calculated. results:  significantly higher mic values were noted in spanish strains of f. nucleatum for penicillin, ciprofloxacin, of p. intermedia for penicillin, amoxicillin and tetracycline, of m. micros for tetracycline, amoxicillin and azithromycin, and of p. gingivalis for tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. based on breakpoint concentrations, a higher number of resistant strains in spain were found in f. nucleatum for penicillin, amoxicillin and metronidazole, in prevotella intermedia for tetracycline and amoxicillin, and in a. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin and azithromycin. resistance of p. gingivalis strains was not observed for any of the antibiotics tested both in spain and the netherlands. conclusions: differences exist in the susceptibility profiles of periodontal pathogens isolated from periodontitis patients in spain and in the netherlands. this implicates that antibiotic susceptibility testing is necessary to determine efficacy of antimicrobial agents. also, clinical studies with antibiotics should  take these differences into account. the information from the present study indicates that it may not be possible to develop uniform protocols for usage of antibiotics in the treatment of severe periodontitis in the european union.

TI  == fluorescence based measurements of fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregation and of fusobacterial attachment to mammalian cells.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is a common oral anaerobe associated with gingivitis, periodontal disease and preterm deliveries. coaggregation among oral bacteria is  considered to be a significant factor in dental plaque development. adhesion to host cells was suggested to be important for the f. nucleatum virulence associated with oral inflammation and with preterm births. an uncharacterized fusobacterial galactose inhibitible adhesin mediates coaggregation of f. nucleatum 12230 and f. nucleatum pk1594 with the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. this adhesin is also involved with the attachment of both fusobacterial strains to host cells. however, it has been suggested that additional unidentified fusobacterial adhesins are involved in f. nucleatum virulence associated with preterm births. in this study, a fluorescence-based high throughput sensitive and reproducible method was developed for measuring bacterial coaggregation and bacterial attachment to mammalian cells. using this method we found that coaggregation of f. nucleatum 4h with p. gingivalis and its  attachment to murine macrophages is less inhibitible by galactose than that of f. nucleatum pk1594. these findings suggest that f. nucleatum 4h can serve as a model organism for identifying nongalactose inhibitible f. nucleatum adhesins considered to be involved in fusobacterial attachment to mammalian cells.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == comparison of culture and real-time pcr for detection and quantification of five  putative periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == objectives: bacterial cultivation is a well-established method for analyzing plaque samples. real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is a novel rapid method for the identification and quantification of periodontopathogenic bacteria that has been recently introduced. in this study, we compared real-time pcr with conventional anaerobic cultivation. method: a total of 78 subgingival plaque samples were harvested from pockets > or =5 mm in 22 patients with advanced chronic periodontitis and immediately transferred into transport medium. aliquots were evaluated with species-specific probes by real-time pcr (meridol perio diagnostics, gaba) and anaerobic bacteria culture on selective media for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythensis. the  analysis was performed by two separate, blinded examiners. results: when real-time pcr was compared with the culture method (golden standard) for the detection of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria, the sensitivity and specificity for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 67% and 100%, respectively (kappa:  0.79); for f. nucleatum 73% and 53%, respectively (kappa: 0.21); for p. gingivalis 94% and 84%, respectively (kappa: 0.77); for p. intermedia 33% and 94%, respectively (kappa: 0.26) and for t. forsythensis 92% and 56%, respectively (kappa: 0.51). spearman's correlation coefficients for the quantitative results of both methods were 0.82 for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 0.33 for f. nucleatum, 0.83 for p. gingivalis, 0.38 for p. intermedia and 0.67 for t. forsythensis. conclusion: overall, the agreement between both test methods was excellent for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, fair for t. forsythensis and poor for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the discrepancies in the results may be explained by the inability of cultivation methods to distinguish between close related taxa, and the problems of keeping periopathogenic bacteria viable, which is required for standard cultivation.

TI  == mechanism of visible light phototoxicity on porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == phototoxicity of visible light laser on the porphyrin-producing bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, in the absence of photosensitizers and under aerobic conditions was shown in previous studies. recently, we found that the noncoherent visible light sources at wavelengths of 400-500 nm, commonly used in restorative  dentistry, induced a phototoxic effect on p. gingivalis, as well as on fusobacterium nucleatum, and to a lesser extent on the streptococci sp. to elucidate the mechanism of this phototoxic effect, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were exposed to light (1) under aerobic and anaerobic environments and (2) in the presence of scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ros). phototoxic effect was not observed when the bacteria were exposed to light under anaerobic conditions.  dimethyl thiourea, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, was effective in reducing phototoxicity (p </= 0.05). other scavengers, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbic acid, were less effective when applied separately. these results support the assumption that the phototoxic effect of blue light on the periopathogenic bacteria is oxygen dependent and that hydroxyl radicals play an important role in this process.

TI  == fiber optic fluorescence microprobe for endodontic diagnosis.
AB  == successful endodontic therapy requires total debridement as well as complete obturation of the root canal to the cemento-dentinal junction. the goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy for the detection and localization of pathological dentin, pulpal remnants, and microorganisms within the root canal. specific aims were to identify: 1) characteristic excitation/emission spectra for healthy dentin, decayed dentin, enamel, and pulp; 2) the potential of specific spectral data for  differentiating between these tissues; and 3) the potential of spectral data for  detecting the presence and identifying four common endodontic pathogens. fluorescence spectra were determined in the tissues of permanent human teeth, extirpated healthy and necrotic pulps, and four endodontic pathogens. excitation/emission spectra were collected at 366 nm, 405 nm, and 440 nm excitation. marked differences in spectral signatures between the different tissues under investigation were observed. we postulate that the differences in fluorescence spectra of decayed vs. healthy dentin are due to the loss of mineralized tissue components and increased organic presence and water in these tissues. pulpal tissue showed distinctly different fluorescence spectra from healthy and decayed dentin, providing a basis for differentiating between tissue  categories. each bacterial species demonstrated distinct spectral emission patterns.

TI  == microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. twenty uniradicular  teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. for molecular diagnosis a dna  chip with 20 different species-specific, 16s-rdna-directed catcher probes was used. the microorganisms most frequently detected by the dna chip were: micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, veillonella parvula, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces odontolyticus, and streptococcus constellatus. as expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as t. forsythia and t. denticola could not be identified. in  conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding  the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility variation of 50 anaerobic periopathogens in aggressive periodontitis: an interindividual variability study.
AB  == background/aims: the frequent use of antibiotics in developed countries has led to the emergence of widespread bacterial resistance. in this study, the interindividual variability of the antibiotic susceptibility of 50 putative microorganisms in aggressive periodontitis patients has been evaluated by means of vc (variation coefficient). material and methods: a total of 60 microbial samples were collected from 20 adult patients diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis (2-4 samples by patient). bacterial strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus micros were isolated according to slots' rapid identification method. the susceptibilities to 10 antibiotics were studied: penicillin g (pen), ampicillin (amp), amoxicillin (amx), amoxicillin/clavulanate  (amc), tetracycline (tet), doxycycline (dox), ciprofloxacin (cip), erythromycin (ery), spiramycin (spi) and clindamycin (clin), using the disk diffusion susceptibility test (dds test: kirby-bauer's modified method for anaerobic bacteria). the broth microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration test was carried out as a control test. results: among the 50 identified bacteria, 15 were p. gingivalis, 12 p. intermedia, 8 t. forsythia, 9 f. nucleatum, and 6 p. micros. the results of the dds test show that penicillins (especially amc, amp, and amx), cyclines (especially dox) and clin are highly effective against the 50 anaerobic  studied bacteria. cip and ery have the lowest efficacy against those bacteria. cip shows a very variable activity according to anaerobic bacteria species, being particularly inactive against p. gingivalis and very efficient against t. forsythia and p. micros. spi is also highly efficient but not against p. micros.  conclusions: the interindividual susceptibility of principal periodontal pathogens to antibiotics is not homogeneous and seems to vary according to bacterial species and antimicrobial molecules. this variability seems to be greater with older molecules (pen, tet, ery) than with more recent ones, which indicates more stable results (amc, amx, amp, and dox). p. intermedia appeared to be the bacteria most resistant to penicillins and showed the highest coefficient  variation. together with scaling and root planing, the combination of two antibiotics would therefore seem to be recommended in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis, particularly in the presence of p. intermedia.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == tobacco smoking and periodontal microflora in a saudi arabian population.
AB  == objectives: to explore the subgingival periodontal microflora in a saudi arabian  population with a special focus on its relationship with various smoking habits.  material and methods: a total of 198 individuals in the age range 17-60 years were included in the study. 29% were water-pipe smokers, 18% cigarette smokers, 13% smokers of both water pipe and cigarettes (mixed smokers) and 40% non-smokers. for each individual, a subgingival plaque sample from the deepest site in each quadrant was obtained. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technology was used to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythensis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponoma denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  selenomonas noxia and streptococcus intermedius. two cut-off levels for detection were used, score 1(10(5) bacteria) and score 3 (10(6) bacteria). results: the prevalence of individuals positive for the different microorganisms at score 1 cut-off varied from 7% to 95%. at score 3 cut-off the prevalence varied from 0% to 30%. the depth of sample site was a key factor for detection. when the depth of sample site was taken into account, no statistically significant differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers with regard to occurrence of the microorganisms studied. conclusions: no major differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers regarding the occurrence of the periodontal microorganisms studied suggesting that this portion of the subgingival periodontal microflora is independent of tobacco smoking.

TI  == treponema medium glycoconjugate inhibits activation of human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with phenol-water extracts of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == oral treponemes are well-known as causative agents of periodontal diseases; however, the details have not been fully clarified. here, we examined the effects of treponema medium glycoconjugate on the activation of human gingival fibroblasts using phenol-water extracts from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the phenol-water extracts activated human gingival fibroblasts to mediate il-8 production, as well as il-8 mrna expression, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. t. medium glycoconjugate exhibited no activation of human gingival fibroblasts, while phenol-water extract-induced activation of human gingival fibroblasts was clearly inhibited by t. medium glycoconjugate. furthermore, binding of biotinylated phenol-water extracts to cd14 in the presence of lps-binding protein was blocked with t. medium glycoconjugate. these results suggest that t. medium glycoconjugate has an inhibitory effect on host cell activation by periodontopathic bacteria caused by  binding to cd14- and lps-binding protein.

TI  == dna probe identification of bacteria colonizing internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface: a preliminary study.
AB  == background: currently, there is limited knowledge concerning the specific genus and species of bacteria that may colonize internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface (iai) of two-stage dental implants. the purpose of this study was to use dna probe analysis to identify those periodontopathic bacteria that may inhabit the internal surfaces and healing abutment screw-threads of the iai of dental implants in situ. methods: following osseointegration, bacterial samples for dna probe analysis were obtained from 54  two-stage hydroxyapatite plasma spray-coated implants in 32 patients. using sterile paper points, samples were obtained from the iai of 43 implants and the screw-threads of healing abutments in the other 11 implants. dna probes were available to detect the following microbes: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola. results: all samples taken from healing abutment screw-threads were negative for all target microbes. the aggregate percentage of positive results for each target microbe for samples from internal surfaces of the iai were: 41.9%, a. actinomycetemcomitans, 60.5%, t. forsythensis; 44.2%, c rectus; 60.5%,  e. corrodens; 48.8%, f. nucleatum; 46.5%, p. gingivalis; 55.8%, p. intermedia; and 51.2%, t. denticola. in addition, no significant differences were noted between colonization of individual microbial species when comparing anterior to posterior and maxillary to mandibular implant sites. conclusions: moderate to high levels of eight different periodontopathic microbes inhabiting the internal  surfaces of the iai of 43 two-stage implants in partially edentulous patients were identified by dna probe analysis. the microbes colonized these surfaces within 25 days following the second stage surgery and placement of the healing abutment. in contrast, all samples obtained from screw-threads of 11 healing abutments were dna probe negative. these findings appear to support those of other investigations demonstrating the translocation of bacteria from residual dentition to implants.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of antibiotic therapy in dentistry and  stomatology].
AB  == introduction: this study evaluates the efficacy of various antimicrobial treatments for orofacial infections on the basis of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) criteria. methods: a complete a literature search was undertaken to establish the mic90 values of the five microorganisms most frequently isolated in odontogenic infections and the pharmacokinetic parameters of 13 antibiotics used in these infections. pharmacokinetic simulations were then carried out with mean population parameters and efficacy indexes were calculated for the 47 treatment regimens analyzed. for  drugs showing time-dependent antibacterial killing, the time above mic (t > mic)  was calculated. for drugs with concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, the auc/mic was calculated. results: amoxicillin-clavulanic (500 mg/8 h or 1000 mg/12 h) and clindamycin (300 mg/6 h) in the time-dependent killing group and moxifloxacin (400 mg/24 h) in the concentration-dependent group showed adequate efficacy indexes against the five pathogens considered to be the most commonly implicated in odontogenic infections. the spiramycin plus metronidazole combination, present in the commercial formulation rhodogyl, did not reach satisfactory pk/pd indexes. conclusion: pk/pd indexes, which are useful predictors of the potential efficacy of antibacterial therapy, were used with ontogenic infections in the present study. the pk/pd simulations showed that amoxicillin-clavulanic, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were the most suitable antibiotics for this kind of infection. clinical trials are required to confirm that this methodology is useful in these pathologic processes.

TI  == quantitative detection of volatile sulfur compound- producing microorganisms in oral specimens using real-time pcr.
AB  == objective: it is well-known that some periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus or tan. forsythensis), and treponema denticola, actively produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs), such as h2s and ch3sh. we previously reported a qualitative relationship between periodontopathic bacteria and vscs; however, a quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria in oral specimens is required for further characterization of the relationship between oral bacteria and vscs. in this study, we report a real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing bacteria in oral specimens. subjects and methods: specimens were collected from 22 patients who visited the preventive dentistry and breath odor clinic of kyushu dental college. a real-time pcr assay using the taqman system, based on the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of taq polymerase, was employed for the quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria that produce vscs. results: using real-time pcr, we performed a quantitative analysis of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, tan. forsythia, and t. denticola in the saliva, on the tongue coat, and in the subgingival plaque of patients with oral malodor. conclusion: real-time pcr using the taqman system  can be used for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing oral bacteria.

TI  == thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone) blocks p. gingivalis- and f. nucleatum, but not  e. coli, lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced interleukin-6 (il-6) production in adipocytes.
AB  == an elevated level of c-reactive protein (crp) predicts the future development of  coronary heart disease. periodontitis appears to up-regulate crp. crp is produced by hepatocytes in response to interleukin-6 (il-6). a major source of il-6 in obese subjects is adipocytes. we hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (lps) from  periodontal pathogens stimulated adipocytes to produce il-6, and that the production was suppressed by the drugs targeted against insulin resistance, thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone), since this agent potentially showed an anti-inflammatory effect. mouse 3t3-l1 adipocytes were stimulated with e. coli, p. gingivalis, and f. nucleatum lps. the il-6 concentration in culture supernatants was measured. all lps stimulated adipocytes to produce il-6. although pioglitazone changed adipocyte appearance from large to small, and completely suppressed p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum lps-induced il-6 production, e. coli lps-induced il-6 production was not efficiently blocked. thus, pioglitazone completely blocked periodontal-bacteria-derived lps-induced il-6 production in adipocytes, a major inducer of crp.

TI  == dna-dna hybridization demonstrates multiple bacteria in osteoradionecrosis.
AB  == bone necrosis secondary to radiation was previously attributed to trauma of devitalized bone and microbiological sepsis. however, conventional microbiological technique has failed to demonstrate microorganisms throughout osteoradionecrotic bone, claimed to be hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular. the aim of the present study was to examine such bone for bacteria using dna-dna  hybridization. compared to standard culture methods this technique enables the investigation of a vast number of bacteria in a fairly short time. twelve deep medullary specimens from resected radionecrotic mandibles were studied. a multitude of bacterial species were detected, most of them anaerobic. porphyromonas gingivalis was the most predominant organism, followed by fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum. all samples contained actinomyces, prevotella and f. nucleatum. the results of this study indicate that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, may play a more fundamental role in the pathophysiology of osteoradionecrosis than being merely surface contaminants.

TI  == periodontal infections and pre-term low birth weight: a case-control study.
AB  == objective: pre-term delivery of low-birth-weight infants [pre-term low birth weight (plbw)] remains a significant public health issue and a major cause of neonatal death and long-term health problems. there is a growing consensus that infections remote from fetal-placental unit may influence plbw infants. recent studies have suggested that maternal periodontal disease may be an independent risk factor for plbw. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible link between periodontal infections and plbw by means of clinical and microbiological data in post-partum women with low socioeconomic level. methods:  clinical periodontal recordings comprising dental plaque, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and gingival recession were performed (six sites/tooth) in a total number of 181 women (53 cases and 128 controls) within 3 days post-partum.  subgingival plaque samples from mesio-or disto-buccal aspect of randomly selected one first molar and one incisor tooth have been obtained by paperpoints and were  analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization with respect to 12 bacterial species. in all analyses, the individual subject was the computational unit. thus, mean values for all clinical parameters were calculated and bacterial scores from each individual sample were averaged. statistical methods included student's t-test, fisher's exact test/chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. results: the cases have gained significantly less weight during the pregnancy than did the controls (p<0.05). there were no statistically  significant differences between the cases and controls with regard to the dental  and periodontal parameters and the values of clinical periodontal recordings were found to be very similar (p>0.05). mean and median scores (bacterial loads) of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and streptococcus intermedius in the subgingival plaque sampling sites were significantly higher in the controls than  in the cases (p<0.05). the occurrence rates of p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  selenomonas noxia and s. intermedius were higher in the cases compared with the controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). according to the model created by the multiple logistic regression analysis, p. micros and c. rectus were found to significantly increase the risk of plbw (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), while p. nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans decreased this risk (p<0.01). conclusion: the present findings indicated that when subgingival bacteria were evaluated together, p. micros and c. rectus may have a role in increasing the risk for plbw, although no single bacteria exhibited any relation with the risk of plbw. further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship between periodontal diseases and plbw.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == phototoxic effect of visible light on porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum: an in vitro study.
AB  == the antibacterial effect of visible light irradiation combined with photosensitizers has been reported. the objective of this was to test the effect  of visible light irradiation without photosensitizers on the viability of oral microorganisms. strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus faecalis in suspension or grown on agar were exposed to visible light at wavelengths of 400-500 nm. these wavelengths are used to photopolymerize composite resins widely used for dental restoration. three photocuring light sources, quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp, light-emitting diode and plasma-arc, at power densities between 260 and 1300 mw/cm2 were used for up to 3 min. bacterial samples were also exposed to a near-infrared diode laser (wavelength, 830 nm), using identical irradiation parameters for comparison. the results show that blue light sources exert a phototoxic effect on p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. the minimal inhibitory dose for p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum was 16-62 j/cm2, a value significantly lower than that for s. mutans and s. faecalis (159-212 j/cm2). near-infrared diode laser irradiation did not affect any of the bacteria tested. our results suggest that visible light sources without exogenous photosensitizers have a phototoxic effect mainly on gram-negative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == attachment of oral gram-negative anaerobic rods to a smooth titanium surface: an  electron microscopy study.
AB  == purpose: attachment of bacteria to titanium may differ not only between bacterial species but also between strains within a species. the aim of the present in vitro study was to examine differences in bacterial attachment using 4 gram-negative anaerobic species of bacteria that are considered potential periodontal pathogens. materials and methods: the attachment of clinical and laboratory strains (n = 23) representing 2 fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia to smooth, commercially pure  titanium was examined using scanning electron microscopy. results: all bacterial  strains were attached to the smooth titanium surface by their outer membrane. f nucleatum cells were poorly attached to the titanium, unlike p gingivalis or p intermedia cells, but only slight differences were observed in the quantity of attached cells between the strains within each bacterial group. discussion: in favorable conditions, some anaerobes can attach directly to an inert titanium surface. microbial adhesion and subsequent colonization on the dental implant surface can lead to infection of the peri-implant tissue. conclusion: the results indicated that the avidity of bacterial attachment to a smooth titanium surface varies between species of oral gram-negative anaerobes but not between strains.

TI  == differential regulation of cytokine genes in gingival epithelial cells challenged by fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == il-8 mrna in human gingival epithelial cells (hgecs) is up-regulated by fusobacterium nucleatum, and up-/down-regulated by porphyromonas gingivalis in a  complex interaction in the early stages (< or = 4 h) after infection. the mechanisms involved in this regulation in response to f. nucleatum and/or p. gingivalis infection, and identification of co-regulated cytokine genes, are the  focus of this investigation. heat, formalin or protease treatment of f. nucleatum cells attenuated the il-8 mrna up-regulation. nf-kappab, mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) p38 and mapk kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (mek/erk) pathways were involved in il-8 mrna induction by f. nucleatum. pretreatment of p. gingivalis with heat, formalin or protease enhanced il-8 mrna  induction. nf-kappab, mark p38, and mek/erk pathways were also involved in this induction. in contrast, down-regulation of il-8 mrna by p. gingivalis involved mek/erk, but not nf-kappab or mapk p38 pathways. cdna arrays analysis revealed that mrna down-regulation by p. gingivalis is a specific reaction that only a number of genes, e.g. il-1beta, il-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-2alpha, and migration inhibitory factor-related protein-14, are affected based on examination of 278 cytokine/receptor genes. these data indicate that f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis trigger specific and differential gene regulation pathways in hgecs.

TI  == killing of periodontopathogenic bacteria by photodynamic therapy.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate a new approach for killing periodontopathogenic bacteria using photodynamic therapy (pdt). methods: in this  study, we investigated the photosensitizers chlorin e6, blc 1010, and blc 1014 by three different methods for their effect in pdt on the viability of periodontopathogenic bacterial species. the methods included examination of inhibition zones on agar plates, determination of colony-forming units (cfu), and the use of a bacterial viability kit. results: using the cfu method, we were able to demonstrate that the anaerobic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga gingivalis can be photoinactivated completely by illumination with an intensity of 5.3 j/cm2 in the presence of 10 microm chlorin e6 and 10 microm blc 1010. with the photosensitizers chlorin e6 and blc 1010, we were able to induce zones of inhibition on agar plates. blc 1014 failed to produce a zone of inhibition. the results of the bacterial viability test also showed that the photosensitizer blc 1014 provides the lowest photodynamic effect in comparison to the others. conclusion: the data collected to date suggest that photodynamic therapy with chlorin e6 and blc 1010 is advantageous for suppressing periodontopathogenic bacteria.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == rate of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == although microbiological studies have identified more than 400 bacterial species  in periodontal pockets, only a limited number have been implicated as periodontal pathogens. the purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis. bacterial samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets ((5 mm) of 203 patients: 92 males and 111 females, aged 35-55 years. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and capnophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and a commercial rapid test system. the isolates were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (26.8%), porphyromonas gingivalis (21.9%), capnocytophaga sputigena (16.7%), eikenella corrodens (13.2%), prevotella intermedia (10.5 %), prevotella disiens (3.1%), peptostreptococcus micros (2.9%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (2.2%), prevotella corporis (1.8%), peptostreptococcus magnus (1.3%) and fusobacterium nucleatum (0.4%). no periodontopathogenic bacterial growth was observed in 14 of the samples (6.2%). the number of samples associated with monobacterial growth and polybacterial growth were 74.9% and 18.2% respectively. it is concluded that the  bacterial composition associated with a number of patients' samples is quite complex, and that some of cultivable anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria act as periodontal pathogens in chronic periodontitis.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of endodontic files after cleaning and steam sterilization procedures.
AB  == background: infection control procedures are essential for modern dental practice and they are continually evolving to meet the dental profession's high standards. the present study evaluated the efficacy of two cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers on endodontic files, and evaluated the effect of biological debris on the subsequent sterilization of files. methods: stainless steel and nickel-titanium (niti) files were examined upon removal from the manufacturer's packaging, after instrumentation in root canals of human teeth inoculated with a  broth containing two anaerobic species and one facultative anaerobic species of bacteria, and after instrumentation and cleaning with either an ultrasonic bath or a thermal disinfector. for each file, the bacterial numbers were quantified using routine microbiological techniques in an anaerobic chamber. results: no bacteria were detected from files direct from their packets. the size, taper and  type of file did not affect the ability of either of the cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers. however, an absence of bacteria was more likely when files were cleaned in the thermal disinfector. no bacteria were detected from files that were-subjected to steam sterilization irrespective of the type of prior cleaning procedure. conclusions: steam sterilization eliminated all bacteria from the endodontic files irrespective of the presence of biological debris. the majority of bacteria were eliminated from endodontic files after either ultrasonic cleaning or using a thermal disinfector.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in atheromatous plaques. a controlled clinical and laboratory trial.
AB  == objective: a possible relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease has been suggested. the aims of this controlled clinical study were: (i)  to ascertain the presence of periodontal bacteria dna [actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus)]  in carotid atheromatous plaques and (ii) to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna, if any, in periodontal pockets and in carotid  atheroma in the same patient. methods: a total of 52 patients scheduled for carotid endarderectomy were enrolled in this study. the test group consisted of 26 dentate patients; the control group included 26 edentulous patients. a complete periodontal examination, including radiographic orthopanoramic and subgingival plaque sample, was performed in the test population. oral and x-ray examinations were performed in the control group. atheromatous plaques were harvested during surgical procedure for each dentate and edentulous patient and then sent to the microbiological laboratory. subgingival plaque samples and carotid specimens were examined using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique by means of specific primers for periodontal bacteria. amplification of extracted dna was tested using human beta-globin specific-primers. results: out of 52 endarterectomy samples, 12 (seven dentate, five edentulous patients) were excluded as negative to dna amplification. in subgingival plaque samples of 19 test patients, t. forsythensis (79%), f. nucleatum (63%), p. intermedia (53%), p. gingivalis (37%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (5%) were found. no periodontal bacteria dna was detected by pcr in any of the carotid samples in either patient  group. conclusion: the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in atheromatous plaques could not be confirmed by this study and thus no correlation could be established between species associated with periodontal disease and putative bacteria contributing to atheromatous plaques.

TI  == selected endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals: a molecular investigation.
AB  == bacteria located at the apical portion of the root canals are conceivably in a strategic position to induce damage to the periradicular tissues and resulting inflammatory diseases. this study sought to investigate the prevalence of 11 selected putative endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals associated with periradicular lesions. the apical root portion of 23 extracted teeth with carious pulpal exposures and attached periradicular lesions  was sectioned, and the root canals were sampled for microbiological investigation. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed for the presence of 11 bacterial species using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. the results showed that pseuramibacter alactolyticus occurred in 10 cases (44%), treponema denticola in 6 (26%), fusobacterium nucleatum in 6 (26%), porphyromonas endodontalis in 4 (17%), filifactor alocis in 2 (9%), dialister pneumosintes in 1 (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis in 1 (4%), and tannerella forsythensis in 1 (4%).  no sample yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, or campylobacter  rectus. of the samples examined, 17 were positive for at least 1 of the target species. occurrence of these bacterial species in the apical third of infected root canals suggests that they can be involved in causation of periradicular lesions.

TI  == implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  == background: the number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. the  10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. methods: oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. the distance implant bone (dib) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. the  levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using dna probe technology. additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. results: the peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola were not detected. low levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens were found. prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). the mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including escherichia coli and candida albicans. the antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. conclusion: this case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.

TI  == [purification and characterization of sanguicin--a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus sanguis].
AB  == objective: streptococcus sanguis plays an important role in maintaining the periodontal microecological balance. previous studies have demonstrated that sanguicin--a kind of bacteriocin produced by s. sanguis has a prominent function  of inhibiting the growth of putative periodontopathic bacteria (ppb). the aim of  this study was to purify sanguicin and investigate its characters. methods: the raw extract of sanguicin was obtained from cells of s. sanguis by ultrasonication, salting out and dialysis. then the diethyl-aminoethyl-sepharose  gradual washing was done in conjunction with glucosan gel filtration for in the purfication of sanguicin. the characters of purified sanguicin were determined and its inhibitiory effect on ppb was measured by agar diffusion test. results: the purifed sanguicin was obtained; it was heat labile and proteinaceous; and by  sds-page, it showed a main band with the relative molecular mass of 65 x 10(3). the purifed sanguicin had a strong inhibitory effect on p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in vitro. conclusion: our methods are useful for the  purification of sanguicin. sanguicin has inhibitory effect on ppb obviously and will have a good prospect in periodontal ecological therapy.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chilean patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: an association between race/ethnicity and the composition of the subgingival microbiota has been found in chronic periodontitis. a study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of the subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in chileans residing in santiago. methods: twenty-six subjects (mean age 45 +/- 7 years) with chronic periodontitis, mean probing depth (pd) 2.63 +/- 0.5 mm, mean attachment level (al) 3.70 +/- 0.77 mm, and without a  history of periodontal therapy were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, and plaque accumulation were recorded at six sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of every tooth and evaluated for the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the microbial data of the chileans were compared with data from 115 chronic periodontitis patients from boston, massachusetts. since several clinical and demographic parameters differed between the two populations, significance of differences for  each species was determined using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, plaque level, mean pd, gender, and smoking status. results: each of the individual test species was present in at least 25 of the 26 subjects, and 12 subjects (46.1%) harbored all 40 test species. with the exception of prevotella intermedia, all test species colonized more than 75% of sites, and 25 species colonized > or = 90% of sites including the co-colonizing species of advanced periodontal lesions, termed the red complex, composed of the three species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), and treponema denticola as well as fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros, and treponerma socranskii. sixteen of the 40 species differed significantly between chilean and  u.s. subjects. red, yellow, and other complexes were significantly higher in the  chileans, while the actinomyces were higher in the u.s. subjects. conclusions: the composition of the subgingival plaque differs among different subject populations. thus, care should be taken when extrapolating the findings of one study to different ethnic groups.

TI  == effect of supragingival plaque control on subgingival microflora and gingivo-periodontal tissues.
AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a short term evaluation of the effect of supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microflora and gingivoperiodontal tissues in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis. a total of 92 sites from 23 patients were studied; patients ranged between 35 and 60 years of age (x  46.4 +/- 1.71). plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), bleeding on probing (bp), probing depth (pd), and attachment level (al) were measured. subgingival microflora of the same sites was studied by dark field microscopy, and cultures in non-selective and selective media for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (pi/n), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and  fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). the patients were included in a supragingival plaque control program which included oral hygiene training and assessment, and professional control of supragingival plaque and calculus. after 28 days, measurement of clinical parameters and the microbiological study were repeated. the sites were divided according to baseline pd values into: group 1 (5 mm), group 2 (6 mm) and group 3 (> or = 7 mm). results revealed a significant reduction in pi scores, gi scores, pb and pd in groups 2 and 3. no significant difference in al was observed in any of the three groups. pi scores were found to decrease significantly in group 1, and gi scores, bp and pd tended to decrease. a significant increase in coccoid cells and a significant decrease in motile rods and spirochetes, both small and total, was observed in groups 2 and 3. group 1 showed a significant decrease in medium and total spirochetes. at the end of the  study, a significant decrease in pi/n was found in all three groups. significant  decreases were found in pg and fn in groups 3 and 2 respectively. although it holds true that supragingival plaque control reduced a potentially pathogenic subgingival microbiota, this effect was not sufficient to be compatible with healthy gingivoperiodontal tissues.

TI  == modulation of the antibody response by porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in a mouse model.
AB  == successive immunization of mice with fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis has been shown to modulate the specific serum igg responses to these organisms. the aim of this study was to investigate these antibody responses further by examining the igg subclasses induced as well as the opsonizing properties of the specific antibodies. serum samples from balb/c mice immunized with f. nucleatum (gp1-f), p. gingivalis (gp2-p), p. gingivalis followed by f. nucleatum (gp3-pf) f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis (gp4-fp) or saline alone (gp5-s) were examined for specific igg1 (th2) and igg2a (th1) antibody levels using an elisa and the opsonizing properties measured using a neutrophil chemiluminescence assay. while igg1 and igg2a subclasses were induced in all immunized groups, there was a tendency towards an igg1 response in mice immunized with p. gingivalis alone, while immunization with f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis induced significantly higher anti-p. gingivalis igg2a levels than igg1. the maximum light output due to neutrophil phagocytosis of p. gingivalis occurred at 10 min using nonopsonized bacteria. chemiluminescence was reduced using serum-opsonized p. gingivalis and, in particular, sera from p. gingivalis-immunized mice (gp2-p), with maximum responses occurring at 40 min. in contrast, phagocytosis of immune serum-opsonized f. nucleatum demonstrated peak light output at 10 min, while that of f. nucleatum opsonized with sera from saline injected mice (gp5-s) and control nonopsonized bacteria showed peak responses at 40 min. the lowest phagocytic response occurred using gp4-fp serum-opsonized f. nucleatum. in conclusion, the results of the present study have demonstrated a systemic th1/th2 response in mice immunized with p. gingivalis and/or f. nucleatum with a trend towards a th2 response in p. gingivalis-immunized mice and a significantly increased anti-p. gingivalis igg2a  (th1) response in mice immunized with f. nucleatum prior to p. gingivalis. further, the inhibition of neutrophil phagocytosis of immune serum-opsonized p. gingivalis was modulated by the presence of anti-f. nucleatum antibodies, while anti-p. gingivalis antibodies induced an inhibitory effect on the phagocytic response to f. nucleatum.

TI  == microbiologic diagnostics at titanium implants.
AB  == background: the microbiota found at periimplant lesions have been shown to contain putative periodontal pathogens as well as opportunistic species such as staphylococcus spp, enterics, and candida spp. therefore, a microbiologic diagnosis may be of value as guidance before treatment of such lesions. purpose:  the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of some putative pathogens associated with long-term followed-up cases using two different microbiologic procedures. materials and methods: fifteen subjects contributed with plaque samples from teeth and implants; these were analyzed with respect to 18 putative  periimplant pathogens using cultural methods and a deoxyribonucleic acid dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: the number of individuals positive for the analyzed pathogens was similar in samples taken from teeth and implants when analyzed with the dna-dna hybridization technique. when comparing detection frequency by culture procedure and by "checkerboard" technique at implants, the number of individuals positive for these species was lower with the traditional culture technique than with the checkerboard analyses. using a higher cutoff point (> or = 4) with the checkerboard technique, the number of positive individuals was generally lower than that found with the culture technique. when  comparing the techniques on an implant site level, the prevalence obtained by culture was lower for all analyzed species. if the specific species were present  in the samples analyzed by the checkerboard technique, they were present only in  every second sample analyzed with the culture technique. the high specificity values showed that if the checkerboard technique did not detect any porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, or fusobacterium nucleatum, the bacteria were also undetectable by the culture technique. the two methods therefore did not overlap but did supplement each other. conclusions: based on the current results it is recommended that the technique used when analyzing microbiota around titanium implants should be a combination of the two protocols mentioned as they seem to give the most comprehensive outcome when used together.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == induction of calprotectin release by porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide  in human neutrophils.
AB  == calprotectin, a major cytosolic protein of leukocytes, is detected in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells. this protein is known to be a marker for several inflammatory diseases and is detected in inflammatory  gingival tissue with periodontal disease. recently, we found that the calprotectin level in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects. however, the regulation of calprotectin in periodontal disease is unclear. in the present study, we investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharides of periodontopathic bacteria on calprotectin release from human neutrophils. neutrophils from healthy donors were treated with lipopolysaccharides from porphyromonas gingivalis (p-lps), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and escherichia coli. calprotectin of neutrophil was identified by immunoblotting and calprotectin amount was determined by elisa. two subunits (10  and 14 kda) of calprotectin were observed in the cell and medium fractions from neutrophils. p-lps increased calprotectin release from seven to 16 times the control level after 30 min and its effect appeared in a dose-dependent manner (10-1000 ng/ml). lipopolysaccharides from a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced calprotectin release from neutrophils. these results suggest that lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria induce calprotectin release from human neutrophils.

TI  == risk factors for periodontitis in hiv patients.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for periodontitis associated with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. methods: a total of 152 hiv(+) patients were recruited from the care clinic at the university of the pacific school of dentistry. clinical measurements (gingival index, plaque index, bleeding index, probing depth, and attachment loss), gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and subgingival plaque samples were taken  from eight sites of each patient at baseline and 6-month visits. gcf neutrophil elastase was determined by measurement of p-nitroanalide resulting from hydrolysis of an elastase-specific peptide. gcf beta-glucuronidase was determined by release of 4-methylumbelliferone from hydrolysis of a specific substrate. a bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay was used to detect periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples. results: viral load, age, smoking pack-years, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, neutrophil elastase, and beta-glucuronidase were significantly correlated with clinical measurements (0.0001 < p < 0.05). significantly higher levels of elastase, beta-glucuronidase, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found at progressing sites than in non-progressing sites (0.001 < p < 0.05). conclusions: these data indicate that age, smoking pack-years, viral load, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, elastase, and beta-glucuronidase are risk factors for periodontitis in hiv(+) patients.

TI  == [dynamic observation of periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria in modified chemostat using confocal laser scanning microscopy].
AB  == objective: to study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. methods: eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), provotella intermedium  (pi), streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguis (ss), actinomyces viscosus (av) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la) were used. these eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified bm medium supplemented with 2.5 g/l porcine gastric mucin, respectively. after 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on  removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. results: biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (p < 0.001). biofilms of aa were thinner than those of ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by ss and aa per time point. three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. conclusions: gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of gram-negative periodontal pathogens. the relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.

TI  == geographical differences in bacteria detected in endodontic infections using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is an innovative nucleic acid-based assay that has the highest sensitivity of any microbiological technique for the detection of bacteria. the purpose of this study was to use pcr to detect the presence of specific species of bacteria in samples collected from two geographical locations. microbial samples from abscesses of endodontic origin were collected from patients in portland, oregon, and rio de janeiro, brazil. pcrs with species-specific oligonucleotide primers for the 16s ribosomal rna gene were used for detection of the bacteria after dna extraction from each clinical sample. statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in  detection of the bacteria between the two geographical locations for prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, fusobacterium nucleatum,  and porphyromonas gingivalis, but not for porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium necrophorum, and enterococcus faecalis. these results suggest that  differences in bacteria detected or cultured in studies can be associated with geographical location.

TI  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (hbd-2 and hbd-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. a few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. however, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of hbd-2 and hbd-3 against a collection  of oral organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, and candida albicans). radial diffusion assays were used to test hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. there was significant variability in mics, which was strain specific rather than species specific. mics ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-3. hbd-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, respectively. hbd-2 and hbd-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against  the candida species evaluated. interestingly, an association between hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities was noted. this suggests that the two peptides may have similar  mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. the lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to confirm the relationships between oral malodor  and periodontal condition, oral malodor and tongue coating, and to investigate the secretory-immunoglobulin a (s-iga) level in saliva in relation to the accumulation of tongue coating. methods: fifty-four patients complaining of oral  malodor were included in the study. their periodontal conditions, tongue coating  status and salivary characteristics (flow rate, protein and s-iga concentrations) were assessed in addition to the level of volatile sulfur compounds (vsc) in oral cavity. the patients were divided into three groups according to their tongue coating level. results: there are significant relationships between oral malodor  and specific periodontal parameters used. the degree of tongue coating was also significantly correlated with the amount of h2s, ch3sh and the total amount of vsc determined. the concentration of s-iga in the group identified as slight tongue coating was significantly higher than in the moderate or the severe group. by western immunoblotting analysis, a high level of s-iga specific to streptococcus species was recognized in all groups, whereas the reactivity of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum with s-iga was very weak in  both the slight and the moderate groups. conclusion: data herein indicate that tongue coating is closely related to oral malodor. furthermore, s-iga in saliva may influence the accumulation of tongue coating, and s-iga antibodies directed to streptococcus species may play a role in protective immunity against the initial colonization of tongue plaque.

TI  == glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of streptococcus oralis functions as a coadhesin for porphyromonas gingivalis major fimbriae.
AB  == cohesive interactions between porphyromonas gingivalis and plaque-forming bacteria, such as streptococcus oralis, are considered to play an important role  in the colonization of p. gingivalis in periodontal sites. although p. gingivalis fimbriae have been reported to mediate coaggregation with s. oralis, the s. oralis molecule involved has not been identified. we identified the coadhesin of  s. oralis atcc 9811 and purified it by affinity column chromatography. we found that the molecular mass of the purified protein was approximately 40 kda. dot blot and western blot assays showed binding of the 40-kda protein to p. gingivalis fimbriae. further, turbidimetric assays showed that the coadhesin inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and s. oralis in a dose-dependent manner. analyses of the amino-terminal sequences of the protein and its lysyl endopeptidase-cleaved fragments revealed that the coadhesin was identical to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh). next, we cloned the gene that encodes s. oralis gapdh and found that the sequence had a high degree of homology with the sequences of gapdhs of various bacteria, including streptococcus gordonii and fusobacterium nucleatum. to confirm the contribution of s. oralis gapdh to the interaction with p. gingivalis, a recombinant gapdh protein was generated in escherichia coli; this protein bound to p. gingivalis fimbriae and had an inhibitory effect on coaggregation. these results suggest that s. oralis gapdh functions as a coadhesin for p. gingivalis fimbriae. in addition, considering the high degree of homology of the gapdhs of various bacteria, those  of other plaque-forming bacteria also may contribute to the colonization of p. gingivalis.

TI  == association of t cd4 lymphocyte levels and subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in hiv-infected brazilians under haart.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the subgingival microbiota of hiv-infected patients with chronic periodontitis and different t cd4 lymphocyte levels under haart. study design: 64 hiv+ patients (mean age 34.5 +/- 7.3; 75% males) were distributed into group i: chronic periodontitis (> or = 3 sites with  probing pocket depth (ppd) and/or clinical attachment level (cal) > or = 5 mm); and group ii: periodontal health (no sites with ppd > 3 mm and/or cal > 4 mm). all subjects received conventional periodontal therapy. periodontal clinical parameters were evaluated at 6 sites/tooth in all teeth at baseline and 4 months  after therapy. the levels of t cd4 were obtained from the patient's medical record. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the 6 sites with the largest pocket depth in each subject of group i, and 6 randomly selected sites in subjects of group ii. the presence of 22 subgingival species was determined using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. significant microbiological differences within and among groups were sought using wilcoxon signed-rank and mann-whitney tests, respectively. relationships between t cd4 levels and microbiological parameters were determined using kruskal-wallis test. results: sixty-one percent of the hiv-infected patients represented aids cases, although 69% of them were periodontally healthy. the t cd4 lymphocyte mean level was 333 cells/mm3 and viral load was 12,815 +/- 24,607 copies/mm3. yet, the prevalence of chronic periodontitis was relatively low (36%). several periodontal pathogens, in particular t. forsythensis (p < .05), were more prevalent in hiv-positive patients with periodontitis than in hiv-positive subjects with periodontal health. most of the species decreased in frequency after therapy, particularly p. gingivalis (p < .05). e. faecalis and f. nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of patients with chronic periodontitis and lower levels of t cd4 (p < .05), while beneficial species tended to be more frequently detected in individuals with t cd4 counts over 500 cells/mm3. conclusion: the subgingival microbiota of hiv-infected patients with chronic periodontitis include a high prevalence of classical periodontal pathogens observed in non-infected individuals. furthermore, the severe immunosuppression seems to favor the colonization by these species, as well as by species not commonly found in the subgingival microbiota.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  == vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus  spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis  is present.

TI  == innate immune response of oral and foreskin keratinocytes: utilization of different signaling pathways by various bacterial species.
AB  == the innate immune response is critical for the epithelial antimicrobial barrier.  the human beta-defensins are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides that are made by epithelial cells and that play a role in mucosal and skin defenses. human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) is expressed constitutively in epithelial tissues, whereas hbd-2 and hbd-3 are expressed in response to bacterial stimuli or inflammation. previous studies showed that hbd-2 was induced by fusobacterium nucleatum cell wall extract without the involvement of the nf-kappab transcription factors, which typically are associated with innate immunity and inflammation. the goal of this study was to characterize signaling pathways involved in hbd-2 induction in response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. cultured human oral and foreskin keratinocytes were treated separately with inhibitors of nf-kappab, c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk), and p38 and then stimulated with oral commensal streptococcus gordonii, oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, skin commensal staphylococcus epidermidis, or skin pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. different bacteria induced different levels of hbd-2 and in response to the various inhibitors tested, although certain common patterns were observed for commensal-  and pathogen-stimulated cells. hbd-2 induction by all bacteria tested was partially or completely blocked by inhibitors of the jnk and p38 pathways. however, in addition, hbd-2 induction by pathogenic bacteria in both oral and foreskin keratinocytes was blocked by inhibitors of nf-kappab. the results indicate that commensal and pathogenic bacteria utilize different pathways in hbd-2 induction and suggest that epithelial cells from different body sites have  common signaling mechanisms to distinguish between commensal and pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries by laser fluorescence.
AB  == objectives: detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. we thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. methods: autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel,  subgingival calculus, and root caries. periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. results: subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. the calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655  nm. the autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. however, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or  blood clots. for clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. conclusion: the autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting  subgingival calculus and root caries.

TI  == a comparison of the antibacterial efficacies of essential oils against oral pathogens.
AB  == cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathic bacteria are present in dental plaque as biofilms. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of essential oils on the following oral bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. we tested manuka oil, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavandula oil, and romarinus oil and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. the essential oils inhibited the growth of the bacteria tested, manuka oil being the most effective. minimum bactericidal concentration values showed that lavandula oil acts bacteriostatically, and the remaining oils, bactericidally. periodontopathic bacterial strains tested were killed completely by exposure for 30 s to 0.2% manuka oil, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil. tea tree oil and manuka oil showed significant adhesion-inhibiting activity against p. gingivalis. all the essential oils tested inhibited the adhesion of s. mutans. this study showed that, among the essential oils tested, manuka oil and tea tree oil in particular had strong antibacterial activity against periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria. from the viewpoint of safety, we also examined the effects of these essential oils on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that, at a concentration of 0.2%, they had little effect on cultured cells.

TI  == intracellular production and extracellular release of oxygen radicals by pmns and oxidative stress on pmns during phagocytosis of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == in this study we investigated intracellular and extracellular oxygen radical production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) during the phagocytosis of periodontopathic bacteria. in in vitro assays, bacteria of the species porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum were phagocytosed at 37 degrees c for 4 h by purified peripheral human  pmns from healthy subjects (n = 6). superoxide production during phagocytosis was determined by flow cytometry and with a fluorescence/luminescence microplate reader. after phagocytosis, oxidative stress was determined by flow cytometry. both the intracellular and extracellular oxygen radical production by pmns phagocytosing f. nucleatum was significantly greater than that of pmns phagocytosing p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans ( p < 0.01 by the mann-whitney test). moreover, after 4 h of incubation, the oxidative stress of pmns phagocytosing f. nucleatum was significantly greater than that of pmns phagocytosing p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. we conclude that a high level of superoxide production by pmns may damage not only periodontopathic bacteria but also pmns themselves, and may be correlated with the destruction of  periodontal tissue.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with prevotella intermedia.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria from odontogenic infections in taiwan.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of facultative and anaerobic odontogenic infectious flora to various antibiotics. we assessed 178 bacterial strains isolated from 74 patients with odontogenic infections. the e-test was used to determine susceptibility. the microbial flora was predominantly facultative gram-positive organisms and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. the results of antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that ampicillin  resistance was found with a very high level of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) in approximately one third of fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, and eikenella corrodens isolates (mic > or = 8 microg/ml). greater activity was generally noted with amoxicillin than with ampicillin, but even beta-lactamase inhibitor incorporated amoxicillin showed resistance in more than 10% of all groups except viridans group streptococci and  porphyromonas gingivalis. tetracycline and erythromycin were considerably less active against the majority of the tested bacterial strains, while minocycline and doxycycline exerted strong antimicrobial activity and could inhibit strains grown at a very low concentration. among all the tested antibiotics, travofloxacin appears to be a promising drug expressing the highest activities (mic90 < or = 1 microg/ml), and was regarded as a potent bactericidal drug in odontogenic infections.

TI  == positive and negative bacterial associations involving dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  == dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. in this study, samples taken from  abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving d. pneumosintes. dna was extracted from the samples, and the presence of d. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by  means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. positive and negative associations involving d. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of d. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. the association between the pairs containing d. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. d. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the  other target species. d. pneumosintes was positively associated with treponema denticola, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. pectinovorum, and t. vincentii. negative associations were observed with bacteroides forsythus, p. gingivalis, and actinomyces israelii. no pair containing d. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). the findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of d. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen,  usually in a mixed infection. positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as t. denticola and p. endodontalis, suggest that  bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.

AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == effect of smoking and periodontal treatment on the subgingival microflora.
AB  == background: the effect of smoking on the prevalence of periodontal pathogens after periodontal treatment is still not clear. some studies found no effect of the smoking status on the prevalence of periodontal pathogens after therapy, whereas others did. the aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the influence of smoking on the treatment of periodontitis and the composition of the subgingival microflora. method: the study included 59 periodontitis patients (mean age 41.5 years): 30 smokers and 29 nonsmokers. the treatment consisted of initial periodontal therapy and, if necessary, surgery and/or antibiotics. clinical and microbiological data were obtained before and after treatment at the deepest site in each quadrant. a pooled sample was analysed for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotalla intermedia (pi), bacteroides forsythus (bf), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and peptostreptococcus micros (pm). results: for smokers and nonsmokers a significant improvement of the clinical condition was found after treatment. a decrease could be assessed for bleeding on probing (smokers: 0.46; nonsmokers: 0.52) and probing pocket depth (ppd) (smokers: 1.64 mm; nonsmokers: 2.09 mm). furthermore, both groups showed gain of attachment (smokers: 0.68 mm; nonsmokers: 1.46 mm). no significant difference in bleeding on probing and ppd reduction was  found between smokers and nonsmokers. in contrast, nonsmokers showed significantly more gain of attachment than smokers. the microbiological results revealed no differences in the prevalence of the various bacteria between smokers and nonsmokers before treatment. after treatment in nonsmokers, a significant decrease was found in the prevalence of aa (11-3), pg (17-7), pi (27-11), bf (27-11), fn (28-20) and pm (27-17). in smokers, a significant decrease could be shown only for the prevalence of pg (15-5). conclusions: nonsmokers showed more gain of attachment and a greater decrease in the prevalence of periodontal bacteria as compared to smokers. the phenomenon that among smokers, more patients remain culture positive for periodontal pathogens after therapy, may contribute to the often observed unfavourable treatment results in smoker periodontitis patients.

TI  == lethal photosensitization of periodontal pathogens by a red-filtered xenon lamp in vitro.
AB  == background: the ability of helium-neon (he-ne) laser irradiation of a photosensitizer to induce localized phototoxic effects that kill periodontal pathogens is well documented and is termed photodynamic therapy (pdt). objectives: we investigated the potential of a conventional light source (red-filtered xenon lamp) to activate toluidine blue o (tbo) in vitro and determined in vitro model parameters that may be used in future in vivo trials. materials and methods: porphyromonas gingivalis 381 was used as the primary test  bacterium. results: treatment with a 2.2 j/cm2 light dose and 50 micro g/ml tbo concentration resulted in a bacterial kill of 2.43 +/- 0.39 logs with the he-ne laser control and 3.34 +/- 0.24 logs with the lamp, a near 10-fold increase (p =  0.028). increases in light intensity produced significantly higher killing (p = 0.012) that plateaued at 25 mw/cm2. there was a linear relationship between light dose and bacterial killing (r2 = 0.916); as light dose was increased bacterial survival decreased. no such relationship was found for the drug concentrations tested. addition of serum or blood at 50% v/v to the p. gingivalis suspension prior to irradiation diminished killing from approximately 5 logs to 3 logs at 10 j/cm2. when serum was washed off, killing returned to 5 logs for all species tested except bacteroides forsythus (3.92 +/- 0.68 logs kill). conclusions: the data indicate that pdt utilizing a conventional light source is at least as effective as laser-induced treatment in vitro. furthermore, pdt achieves significant bactericidal activity in the presence of serum and blood when used with the set parameters of 10 j/cm2, 100 mw/cm2 and 12.5 micro g/ml tbo.

TI  == genomics of oral bacteria.
AB  == advances in bacterial genetics came with the discovery of the genetic code, followed by the development of recombinant dna technologies. now the field is undergoing a new revolution because of investigators' ability to sequence and assemble complete bacterial genomes. over 200 genome projects have been completed or are in progress, and the oral microbiology research community has benefited through projects for oral bacteria and their non-oral-pathogen relatives. this review describes features of several oral bacterial genomes, and emphasizes the themes of species relationships, comparative genomics, and lateral gene transfer. genomics is having a broad impact on basic research in microbial pathogenesis, and will lead to new approaches in clinical research and therapeutics. the oral microbiota is a unique community especially suited for new challenges to sequence the metagenomes of microbial consortia, and the genomes of uncultivable bacteria.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial activity of mangifera indica on anaerobic dental microglora based on in vivo studies.
AB  == the present study was carried out to compare the subgingival plaque microflora in mango leaf users. fifty subjects of both sexes, 25 of them used tooth brush and 25 used mango leaf as their home care hygiene device were included in the study.  the microbiological evaluation for specific bacterial counts of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros were carried out for all subject. specific microbial evaluation revealed significant decrease in the proportion of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis in mango leaf users compared to tooth brush users. it shows that mangiferin possesses antibacterial activity in vivo against specific periodontal pathogens such as p. intermedia and p. gingivalis. use of mango leaf in conjunction with a tooth brush will be a good home care device for maintenance of oral hygiene.

TI  == additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  == it is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to ca(oh)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. the objective of this study was to  identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. ca(oh)2  was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. efficacy of killing was compared for (a) ca(oh)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (zno) points alone; (c) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno points; (d) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno/chlorhexidine points; and (e) ca(oh)2 points combined with zno/chlorhexidine points. common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. in the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by  ca(oh)2 alone. combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. for the inactivation of the gram-positive bacteria p. micros and s. intermedius, a combination of ca(oh)2 and zno/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria  faster than ca(oh)2 alone. for e. faecalis, combining ca(oh)2 suspension with zno/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. the results of this study support the use of a combination of ca(oh)2  and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of p. micros and s. intermedius from infected root canals.

TI  == pcr method is essential for detecting mycobacterium tuberculosis in oral cavity samples.
AB  == tuberculosis is a re-emerging infectious disease, and infection by mycobacterium  tuberculosis has been increasing in immunocompromised hosts, including elderly persons. m. tuberculosis-infected persons may receive dental treatment. to evaluate the risk of m. tuberculosis infection in dental clinics, we examined the detection rates of m. tuberculosis in sample of mixed saliva, dental plaque, extracted teeth, caries lesions, and denture plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the detection rates by pcr in samples from mixed saliva, dental plaque, caries lesions and denture plaque obtained from tuberculosis patients were 98.0%, 92.0%, 89.0%, and 100%, respectively. the detection rates by the culture method were 17.3%, 2.0%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. m. tuberculosis also was detected from the nontuberculous mycobacteria-infected group. strains of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum inhibited the growth of clinical strains of m. tuberculosis, but strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans did not. the present study concludes that the pcr method is essential for detecting m. tuberculosis in oral samples.

TI  == the effects of a new mouthrinse containing chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride and zinc lactate on the microflora of oral halitosis patients: a dual-centre, double-blind placebo-controlled study.
AB  == aim: this study evaluated the microbial effects of a newly formulated mouthwash (halita) on oral halitosis patients. methods: forty subjects were included in this dual-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study. inclusion and  exclusion criteria were used to select patients. at baseline and at 2 weeks post-treatment, full-mouth organoleptic odor scores, level of volatile sulphur compounds (vsc) and the winkel tongue coating index were recorded. standardized samples of tongue coating, saliva and subgingival plaque were microbiologically investigated. participants were randomly assigned to the test or placebo groups.  results: high prevalences were observed for fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis in tongue coating, saliva and subgingival plaque samples. a significant positive correlation between baseline total counts  of p. gingivalis in saliva samples and organoleptic and vsc scores was found. two weeks post-treatment there was a reduction in total anaerobic counts in all samples in the test group. a significant positive correlation was observed between the reduction in total counts in saliva samples and the reduction in organoleptic scores in the test group. significant reductions in total counts and proportions of f. nucleatum and total counts of p. intermedia in tongue coating samples were observed in the test group. conclusions: the test mouthwash demonstrated efficacy in reducing the microbiological parameters in three oral niches in moderate to severe halitosis patients without periodontitis, and this was correlated with the improvements in organoleptic and vsc scores but not with  the tongue coating scores.

TI  == ovine periodontitis as a potential model for periodontal studies. cross-sectional analysis of clinical, microbiological, and serum immunological parameters.
AB  == objectives: : to investigate infection and host immunity patterns in sheep with naturally occurring "broken-mouth" periodontitis. materials and methods: : eight  periodontally healthy (hs) and eight periodontally diseased ewes (pds) were selected. subgingival plaque and sera were collected and examined for evidence of human periodontitis-associated pathogens. serum igg titers were measured by elisa to multiple strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, dichelobacter nodosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum as well as several purified antigens (cysteine proteases, lps, k, and fimbriae). results: : neither the organism aa nor antigens to aa were found in any animal. most animals were positive for pg, bf, and pi, but dna probes detected no difference between hs and pds relative to  amounts of pathogens in subgingival plaque. pds had significantly higher serum igg titers to all pg strains, to 50% of bf strains, to the pi and fn strains, and to fimbriae and the two cysteine proteases (p-values ranging from 0.05 to 0.001). regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between number of teeth lost and serum igg antibody titers to whole-cell sonicate antigens of p. gingivalis strains (p<0.01) and body weight (p<0.01). conclusions: : the presence of pathogens associated with periodontitis was reflected in differences in serum  igg titers between healthy and diseased sheep. this may have influenced animal body weight and might have systemic health and economic consequences. the data suggest that susceptible and non-susceptible sheep can be identified for periodontal research.

TI  == serum phenytoin concentration and igg antibody titre to periodontal bacteria in patients with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == epileptic patients taking phenytoin with gingival-overgrowth and those without gingival-overgrowth were compared for daily drug dose, plasma total phenytoin concentration, plasma free-phenytoin concentration and serum igg antibody titre against 13 periodontal bacteria. significantly higher daily drug dose was noted in patients with gingival overgrowth (p < 0.05) when compared with those without  overgrowth. in addition, both total and free forms of plasma phenytoin concentration were significantly higher in sera of patients with gingival growth  than of those without overgrowth (p < 0.01). strong positive correlation was found between daily drug dose and serum phenytoin concentration in patients with  gingival overgrowth, while weak correlation was found in patients without gingival overgrowth, suggesting a difference in drug metabolism in these two groups. however, no differences were found in serum igg antibody titres to 13 periodontal bacteria examined between two groups. these results suggest that metabolic ability of phenytoin is one of the factors for developing gingival overgrowth, and that periodontal infection may not be a primary causative factor  for gingival overgrowth but act as an additive factor which increase tissue mass  for this unwanted side effect.

TI  == acid-neutralizing activity during amino acid fermentation by porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == acid-neutralizing activity during amino acid fermentation by washed cells of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum was studied. when the washed cells of these strains were anaerobically incubated in the presence of aspartylaspartic acid or glutamylglutamic acid for p. gingivalis, aspartic acid for p. intermedia and glutamic acid for f. nucleatum at an initial  ph of 5.0 or 5.5, the ph of the incubation mixtures rose toward neutral. f. nucleatum had the highest acid-neutralizing activity, followed by p. intermedia and p. gingivalis. the p. intermedia and f. nucleatum cells were used to measure  the amounts of base produced at a fixed ph of 5.0. these cells generated significant amounts of base at ph 5.0 along with the production of organic acids  and ammonia from aspartic or glutamic acid. acid-base balance theoretically calculated from the amounts of consumed substrate and end products implies that the acid-neutralizing activity was derived from the decrease in acidity during the fermentation of amino acid into organic acids and ammonia.

TI  == helicobacter pylori and campylobacter rectus share a common antigen.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of antigens with immunological cross-reactivity in periodontopathogenic bacteria and helicobacter  pylori, the pathogen associated with gastritis and peptic ulcers in human. materials and methods/results: among the putative periodontopathogens tested (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola), cross-reactive bands were only detected in c. rectus by sds-page/western immunoblotting analysis using a polyclonal antibody directed to  h. pylori cells. one of these cross-reactive antigens, a 64-kda band antigen, also reacted with a monoclonal antibody directed to the human heat shock protein  (hsp) 60. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of this c. rectus protein revealed a high degree of homology with corresponding regions of other hsps belonging to the hsp60 family, indicating that the 64-kda antigen was a groel protein. the nucleotide sequence of the c. rectus groel protein coded for a 547 amino acid protein with a predicted size of 57.8 kda. comparison of the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of the groel protein of c. rectus with that of h. pylori showed a high degree of similarity throughout its length (76.8%). groel protein from c. rectus possessed the ability to stimulate production of il-6 by a confluent monolayer of human gingival epithelial cells and was cytotoxic when used at a high concentration. conclusions: this study reveals an immunological relationship between h. pylori and c. rectus, and clearly indicates that one of the shared antigens is a groel protein possessing a biological activity that might play a role in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease.

AB  == background: it has been suggested that locally produced immunoglobulin (ig)a could be more protective than igg and that there could be a relationship between  crevicular fluid-specific iga levels and the onset of periodontal disease. this study was designed to investigate this hypothesis regarding specific immune responses towards 4 plaque anaerobes in gingival crevicular fluid and saliva from patients with periodontopathies and controls. methods: gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) and whole saliva were collected from 35 adults with periodontitis and 24 periodontally healthy adults (controls). antigens were extracted from actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum and used to set up specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) tests to assess iga and igg levels to these microorganisms in the fluids collected. results: the crevicular fluid of periodontitis patients contained significantly higher levels of igg to the 4 microorganisms tested than  that of controls (p < 10(-6) for all comparisons). iga levels to the 4 bacteria were statistically significantly much higher in control crevicular fluid (p < 10(-7) for all comparisons). controls also had statistically significantly higher levels of specific salivary iga than patients (p < 0.02 for all comparisons). conclusions: these data support the potentially protective role of specific iga directed to oral microorganisms involved in the onset and development of periodontal disease.

TI  == igg subclass specific antibody response to periodontopathic organisms in hiv-positive patients.
AB  == background: we previously reported an increased rate of progression of periodontal disease over an 18-month period in human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-positive subjects compared to controls. the mechanism for disease progression and rapid tissue loss was unknown. data on the microbiological studies failed to show any significant difference in the microbial characteristics of the periodontal lesions in hiv-positive patients compared to hiv-negative controls. immunological analysis had identified neutrophils as an important component of the host defense against periodontal infection, especially against rapid tissue loss. serum igg reactivities to periodontal pathogens in hiv-positive patients with periodontitis were reduced. other data provided circumstantial evidence to suggest that igg subclass (igg2) specific antibody might assist bacterial clearing in periodontal infection. the aim of the current  study was to examine the specific igg subclass antibody response to a panel of periodontopathic organisms: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), and bacteroides forsythus (bf) in hiv-positive patients compared to hiv-negative controls. methods: sera from 120 hiv-positive patients (40 periodontitis, 69 gingivitis, and 11 no oral diseases)  were tested for igg subclass specific antibody response to the above listed 6 organisms using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. data were compared with those  obtained from 40 hiv-negative control subjects (35 periodontitis, 2 gingivitis, and 3 no oral diseases). results: in the hiv-positive group, a consistently high  response rate was found in igg1 to all the bacteria tested. in addition, high levels of igg3 and igg4 to pg and igg1 and igg2 to pi were also present. however, no significant difference was detected among the periodontitis, gingivitis, and no oral disease subgroups. when the periodontitis patients from the hiv-positive  group were compared to the hiv-negative group, no difference in the antibody levels and response rates was noted. conclusion: we conclude that in hiv-positive patients, the specific igg subclass antibody response to periodontopathic organisms was similar to that of hiv-negative subjects.

AB  == objective: human parotid histidine-rich-polypeptides (hrps) are a family of lowmolecular-weight, cationic polypeptides. hrp-1, hrp-3 and hrp-5 comprise 85%-90% of the total hrps and are called major hrps. there were many researches indicating the antimicrobial activities of hrps. recently, hrps were reported to  have an inhibitory action on the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of e. coli, with hrp-5  being the most effective one among the three major hrps. since the lps of oral gram-negative bacteria is thought to be one of the important etiological factors  during the development of periodontal diseases, our experiment was aimed to investigate the neutralizing effect of human parotid hrp-5 on the lps of anaerobic suspected periodontal pathogens, which have different chemical structures and biological activities compared with lps of aerobic e. coli. methods: by using of preparative acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (au-page), hrp-5 was purified from parotid saliva collected from healthy adults.  two stains of suspected periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g, 47-a) and fusobacterium nuceatum (f. n, separated from subgingival plaque of a patient with adult periodontitis) were mass cultured. after harvested in the midlogarithmic phase, they were washed and lyophilized. the lps of dried bacteria were extracted by the modified westphal hot phenol-water procedures and purified  by the enzyme digestion plus ultracentrifugation. limulus test was applied to test the neutralizing effect of hrp-5 on the lps-induced gelation of limulus amoebocyte lysate. in brief, the standard lps of e. coli, or extracted lps of p.  g or f. n, was preincubated with hrp-5 in a tube separately in room temperature for 10 minutes. then the reagent of limulus amoebocyte lysate was added in all the tubes, continued the incubation in 37 degrees c for one hour. after that, the gelation level of every tube was observed. results: lps extracted from p. g and f. n both showed good purity and strong activities to induce gelation of limulus  amoebocyte lysate. the gelation induced by lps (1 ng/ml) of these two anaerobic suspected periodontal pathogens were weakly inhibited by hrp-5 (10 micrograms/ml), similar to that observed with standard lps of e. coli. to get a complete neutralizing effect on lps, it may be important to increase the concentration of hrp-5. conclusion: it appeared that hrps could neutralize the endotoxic properties of lps of suspected periodontal pathogens, therefore may contribute to periodontal health. the present investigation further confirmed that hrps are important components of the host non-immune defense system.

AB  == this study evaluated the similarity between the oral microbiota of young children and that of their adult caregivers. oral samples from children (174 dentate and 18 pre-dentate) aged 6-36 months and their caregivers in saipan were assayed using a dna probe assay. many species including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces species, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium  nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in dentate and pre-dentate children, whereas bacteroides forsythus was detected only in dentate children. a higher percentage of children were positive for the detection of an individual species if the caregiver was also positive. there were significant relative risks of species detection between dentate children and their caregivers. by logistic regression, there were significant positive associations between species detection in caregiver and in child, but not between species detection and child age or maternal education level. in conclusion, dental pathogens were detected in young, including pre-dentate, children. the microbial profiles of children were strongly associated with the microbiota of their caregivers.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == in vitro effect of laser irradiation on cementum-bound endotoxin isolated from periodontally diseased roots.
AB  == background: in a previous study, we evaluated the in vivo effects of an nd:yag laser on periodontal disease by measuring crevicular interleukin (il)-1beta levels before and after laser application. it was found that laser therapy was less effective than traditional scaling and root planing. these results might be  due to incomplete removal of microbial residues and cementum-bound endotoxin on root surfaces by the laser. in this study, we explored the in vitro effectiveness of an nd:yag laser for the elimination of cementum-bound endotoxin by measuring il-1beta changes in stimulated monocytes. methods: fresh human monocytes were harvested from adults without periodontitis and grown in rpmi 1640 medium. diseased cementum particles were collected and prepared from teeth with untreated periodontitis and were irradiated with 5 levels of laser energy. cementum particles were subjected to endotoxin testing by a limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) assay and then were incubated with cultured monocytes. production of il-1beta in  stimulated monocytes was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantified by spectrophotometry. results: the endotoxin unit (eu) of diseased cementum was 18.4 eu/mg, which seemed to be remarkably lower than that of common  periodontal pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis (381) at 15,300 eu/mg/ml, prevotella intermedia (atcc 25611) at 227 eu/mg/ml, and fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 25586) at 1,987 eu/mg/ml. monocytes subjected to stimulation by diseased cementum particles without laser irradiation produced 124 to 145 pg/ml il-1beta, 9- to 18-fold higher than that of unstimulated monocytes (7.07 to 15.95 pg/ml). diseased cementum particles after irradiation with various energy levels  of the nd:yag laser could still stimulate monocytes to secrete 89 to 129 pg/ml il-1beta. no statistically significant difference was found in the production of  il-1beta induced by diseased-bound cementum with or without laser irradiation. conclusions: the nd:yag laser varying from 50 mj, 10 pps to 150 mj, 20 pps, for 2 minutes, did not seem to be effective in destroying diseased cementum endotoxin.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and other putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with and without periodontal destruction.
AB  == background and aims: bacteria play an essential role in the pathogenesis of destructive periodontal disease. it has been suggested that not all bacteria associated with periodontitis may be normal inhabitants of a periodontally healthy dentition. in particular, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans have been isolated infrequently from subjects without periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare prevalence and proportions of a number of periodontal bacteria in periodontitis patients and control subjects. material and methods: in all, 116 consecutive subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe periodontitis (mean age 42.4) and 94 subjects without radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss (mean age 40.4) were recruited for the study. the gingival condition in the control group varied between gingival health and various degrees of gingivitis. in patients, the deepest pocket in each quadrant was selected for microbiological sampling. in control subjects all mesial and distal sites of all first molars were selected for sampling. all paper points from a patient were pooled and processed for anaerobic cultivation within 6 h after sampling. clinical variables of sampled sites included bleeding index, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more often prevalent in patients than in controls. the highest odds ratios were found for p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (12.3 and 10.4 resp.). other odds ratios varied from 3.1 to 7.7 for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. micros, respectively. absolute numbers of target bacteria were all higher in patients, but only the mean percentage of b. forsythus was significantly higher in patients in comparison to controls (p < 0.001). conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, f. nucleatum and p. micros are all significant markers for destructive periodontal disease in adult subjects. based  on calculated odds ratios, b. forsythus and p. gingivalis are the strongest bacterial markers for this disease and are infrequently cultured from subjects without periodontal bone loss.

TI  == antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin against periodontal anaerobic pathogens involved in systemic infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of penicillin g, amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin, erythromycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 158 isolates associated with periodontal infections. mic(50)/mic(90) values of moxifloxacin were respectively 0.06/0.5 mg/l for porphyromonas gingivalis (35), for prevotella spp. (28) and actinomyces spp. (35), 0.12/0.25 mg/l for fusobacterium nucleatum (20) and 0.06/0.12 mg/l for peptostreptococcus spp. (30). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range of moxifloxacin for bacteroides forsythus (6) and campylobacter rectus (4) was 0.06-0.12 mg/l. the minimum bactericidal concentrations were equal to or 2-4 times the mic values. moxifloxacin produced a bactericidal effect at 8 h. our results show that moxifloxacin has good antibacterial activity against periodontal pathogens comparable with that of cefoxitin and amoxycillin/clavulanate, and better than that of clindamycin, metronidazole and penicillin.

TI  == pcr-based identification of bacteria associated with endodontic infections.
AB  == pcr primers that target the bacterial 16s rrna genes (or the tuf gene for the genus enterococcus) were used to identify 10 putative bacterial pathogens in root canals with necrotic pulp. in addition, the associations of these microorganisms  with symptoms and a history of diabetes mellitus were investigated. microbial samples from the root canals of 24 teeth with necrotic pulp were included in the  study. pcr with universal bacterial primers identified bacterial dna in 22 specimens; the remaining 2 specimens were from intact teeth that had been traumatized 6 months prior to treatment. pcr with specific primers showed that preoperative symptoms were significantly associated with the presence of streptococcus spp. (p < 0.001 by chi-square analysis). there was also a nonsignificant trend for symptoms to be associated with fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis (odds ratio, >2) and for diabetes mellitus to be associated with p. gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis (odds ratio, >2). cloning and sequencing of the universal pcr product in one specimen revealed the  presence of an organism related to the genus olsenella, which has not previously  been described in endodontic infections.

TI  == microbiological, immunological and genetic factors in family members with periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, associated with hematological disorders.
AB  == the microflora, immunological profiles of host defence functions, and human leukocyte antigen (hla) findings are reported for a mother, son and daughter who  were diagnosed as having 'periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases,  associated with hematological disorders'. examinations were made of the bacterial flora from the periodontal pocket, neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil phagocytosis, and the genotypes (dqb1) and serotypes (dr locus) of hla class ii antigens. phenotypic analyses of the peripheral lymphocytes were also conducted.  the subgingival microflora from the mother was dominated by gram-negative rods, especially porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum. subgingival microflora samples from the son and daughter were dominated by gram-positive cocci and gram-positive rods. through the use of polymerase chain reaction, campylobacter rectus and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in all subjects, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, p. intermedia, and treponema denticola were not detected in any subjects. all three subjects showed a remarkable level of depressed neutrophil chemotaxis to n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, although their phagocyte function levels were normal, in comparison to healthy control subjects. each subject had the same genotype, hla-dqb1*0601, while the mother had hla-dr2 and hla-dr8, and the son and daughter had hla-dr2 only. in summary, the members of this family showed a similar predisposition to periodontitis with regard to certain host defence functions. it is suggested that the depressed neutrophil chemotaxis that was identified here could be a significant risk factor for periodontitis in this family.

TI  == contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens.
AB  == experimental studies have shown that intraoral transmission of bacteria can occur. of course, the question arises as to how this transmission may happen. in  this study, the contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens is examined and compared to the microbial load of the periodontal pockets. in ten untreated chronic periodontitis patients, four interdental sites were professionally brushed with one interdental brush per patient. subsequently, samples from the depths of the pockets (of the specific interdental sites) were obtained with paper-points. the interdental brush samples and the samples of the  subgingival plaque, obtained by the pooled paper-points, were processed for dark-field microscopy examination as well as anaerobic culturing. the results showed that, although significant differences could be found between the brushes  and paper-points with direct microscopy, the culturing did not uncover many differences. on the contrary, the detection frequencies of specific bacterial species were almost the same between the two. the total anaerobic colony-forming  units (cfu), p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and e. corrodens found on the brushes showed a significant correlation with the subgingival plaque samples (p<0.005). these results suggest that, in untreated situations, interdental brushes are contaminated relatively easily by putative periodontopathogens in numbers comparable to their presence in periodontal pockets. this contamination could be  a factor in the intraoral spread of bacteria.

TI  == 3-chloro-dl-alanine resistance by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
AB  == the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.

TI  == influence of secondary colonizers and human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
AB  == the influence of secondary colonizers (fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. hydroxyapatite (hap) discs coated with streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3h-labeled bacterial cell suspension of  f. nucleatum or a. naeslundii and then in a 14c-labeled p. gingivalis cell suspension. bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. the cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. these two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of p. gingivalis. human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of p. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to s. sanguis-coated hap discs. adherence of p. gingivalis and a. naeslundii was  strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of f. nucleatum was affected the least.  treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of p. gingivalis. the rate of decrease was much smaller in f. nucleatum. these results indicate that both f. nucleatum and a. naeslundii enhance the adherence of p. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of p. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == mice lacking monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 have enhanced susceptibility to an interstitial polymicrobial infection due to impaired monocyte recruitment.
AB  == monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) is an important chemokine that induces monocyte recruitment in a number of different pathologies, including infection. to investigate the role of mcp-1 in protecting a host from a chronic interstitial polymicrobial infection, dental pulps of mcp-1(-/-) mice and controls were inoculated with six different oral pathogens. in this model the recruitment of leukocytes and the impact of a genetic deletion on the susceptibility to infection can be accurately assessed by measuring the progression of soft tissue  necrosis and osteolytic lesion formation. the absence of mcp-1 significantly impaired the recruitment of monocytes, which at later time points was threefold higher in the wild-type mice than in mcp-1(-/-) mice (p < 0.05). the consequence  was significantly enhanced rates of soft tissue necrosis and bone resorption (p < 0.05). we also determined that the mcp-1(-/-) mice were able to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) to a similar or greater extent as controls and to produce equivalent levels of porphyromonas gingivalis-specific total immunoglobulin g (igg) and igg1. these results point to the importance of mcp-1 expression and monocyte recruitment in antibacterial defense and demonstrate that antibacterial defense is not due to an indirect effect on pmn recruitment or modulation of the adaptive immune response.

AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == enumeration of viable anaerobic bacteria by solid phase cytometry under aerobic conditions.
AB  == classical enumeration methods for anaerobes are time-consuming and require special conditions. solid phase cytometry (spc) is a recent laser scanning technique for the quantitative detection of fluorescently labelled bacteria on a  membrane filter that eliminates the need for a growth phase. fluorescent labelling of cells results from the cleavage by intracellular esterases of a fluorescein type ester to yield a free fluorescein derivative, which is retained  only in cells with an intact cytoplasmic membrane. however, as the standard labelling procedure is carried out under the conditions of aerobiosis, labelling  of anaerobic bacteria does not appear to be obvious. we have labelled eight strains of vegetative anaerobic bacteria (i.e. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium bifermentans, c. butyricum, c. perfringens, fusobacterium nucleatum,  porphyromonas canoris, p. gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes) and two strains of spores (c. butyricum, c. perfringens,) within 4 h under aerobic conditions. however, anaerobiosis remained necessary for spores of c. sordellii, c. sporogenes, c. tyrobutyricum. for vegetative cells of all strains, plots of spc versus plate counts were linear with slopes exceeding 1.0, indicating that spc consistently yielded higher numbers of bacteria.

AB  == background: different periodontopathogenic microbiota have been associated with periodontal diseases in several populations. the present investigation determined the subgingival microbiota of untreated chronic periodontitis brazilians using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. methods: twenty-five periodontitis patients (mean age, 41 +/- 2; mean probing depth [pd], 3.3 +/- 0.2; mean attachment level [al], 3.6 +/- 0.2) with no history of previous periodontal  therapy and a control group of 14 healthy subjects (mean age, 34 +/- 0.6; mean pd, 1.8 +/- 0.2; mean al, 1.7 +/- 0.1) were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation, and suppuration were recorded at 6 sites/tooth. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 4 sites in each tooth/subject in both groups. the presence and levels of 41 subgingival species were determined in 4,032 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. results: periodontal pathogens, as well as some unusual species (e. faecalis, e. coli and bartonella sp.), were detected significantly more often and/or in higher levels in the periodontitis group (p < 0.05). most species were more frequently detected in interproximal sites. b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, e. nodatum, and f. nucleatum ss vincentii showed a significant positive correlation with mean pd and al (p < 0.05). conclusions: the subgingival microbiota of brazilians with untreated chronic periodontitis were complex, including high proportions of periodontopathogens commonly found in other populations, as well as some unusual species.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

TI  == genome sequence and analysis of the oral bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum strain atcc 25586.
AB  == we present a complete dna sequence and metabolic analysis of the dominant oral bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum. although not considered a major dental pathogen on its own, this anaerobe facilitates the aggregation and establishment  of several other species including the dental pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis  and bacteroides forsythus. the f. nucleatum strain atcc 25586 genome was assembled from shotgun sequences and analyzed using the ergo bioinformatics suite (http://www.integratedgenomics.com). the genome contains 2.17 mb encoding 2,067 open reading frames, organized on a single circular chromosome with 27% gc content. despite its taxonomic position among the gram-negative bacteria, several features of its core metabolism are similar to that of gram-positive clostridium  spp., enterococcus spp., and lactococcus spp. the genome analysis has revealed several key aspects of the pathways of organic acid, amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. nine very-high-molecular-weight outer membrane proteins are predicted from the sequence, none of which has been reported in the literature. more than 137 transporters for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as peptides, sugars, metal ions, and cofactors have been identified. biosynthetic pathways exist for only three amino acids: glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine.  the remaining amino acids are imported as such or as di- or oligopeptides that are subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm. a principal source of energy appears  to be the fermentation of glutamate to butyrate. additionally, desulfuration of cysteine and methionine yields ammonia, h(2)s, methyl mercaptan, and butyrate, which are capable of arresting fibroblast growth, thus preventing wound healing and aiding penetration of the gingival epithelium. the metabolic capabilities of  f. nucleatum revealed by its genome are therefore consistent with its specialized niche in the mouth.

AB  == clinical data from the first 812 deliveries from a cohort study of pregnant mothers entitled oral conditions and pregnancy (ocap) demonstrate that both antepartum maternal periodontal disease and incidence/progression of periodontal  disease are associated with preterm birth and growth restriction after adjusting  for traditional obstetric risk factors. in the current study we present measures  of maternal periodontal infection using whole chromosomal dna probes to identify  15 periodontal organisms within maternal periodontal plaque sampled at delivery.  in addition, maternal postpartum igg antibody and fetal exposure, as indexed by fetal cord blood igm level to these 15 maternal oral pathogens, was measured by whole bacterial immunoblots. the potential role of maternal infection with specific organisms within 2 bacterial complexes most often associated with periodontitis, conventionally termed "orange" (campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia) and "red" (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola) complexes, respectively, to prematurity was investigated by relating the presence of oral infection, maternal igg, and fetal  cord igm, comparing full-term to preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks). the prevalence of 8 periodontal pathogens was similar among term and preterm mothers  at postpartum. there was a 2.9-fold higher prevalence of igm seropositivity for one or more organisms of the orange or red complex among preterm babies, as compared to term babies (19.9% versus 6.9%, respectively, p = 0.0015, chi square). specifically, the prevalence of positive fetal igm to c. rectus was significantly higher for preterm as compared to full-term neonates (20.0% versus  6.3%, p = 0.0002, as well as p. intermedia (8.8% versus 1.1%, p = 0.0003). a lack of maternal igg antibody to organisms of the red complex was associated with an increased rate of prematurity with an odds ratio (or) = 2.2; confidence interval  (ci) 1.48 to 3.79), consistent with the concept that maternal antibody protects the fetus from exposure and resultant prematurity. the highest rate of prematurity (66.7%) was observed among those mothers without a protective red complex igg response coupled with a fetal igm response to orange complex microbes (combined or 10.3; p < 0.0001). these data support the concept that maternal periodontal infection in the absence of a protective maternal antibody response is associated with systemic dissemination of oral organisms that translocate to the fetus resulting in prematurity. the high prevalence of elevated fetal igm to  c. rectus among premature infants raises the possibility that this specific maternal oral pathogen may serve as a primary fetal infectious agent eliciting prematurity.

TI  == dipeptide utilization by the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum, which can frequently be isolated from periodontal pockets, preferentially utilize proteins and peptides as growth substrates. in this study, we determined the size of peptide that is preferentially utilized as  a source of energy and material for cell growth by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia,  p. nigrescens and f. nucleatum using various sizes of poly amino acids consisting of two to approximately 100 molecules of aspartate or glutamate. resting cells of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens utilized aspartylaspartate, while  cells of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum utilized glutamylglutamate. the addition  of aspartylaspartate to the culture medium increased the growth of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens, while the addition of glutamylglutamate promoted the growth of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. these results clearly indicate that dipeptides such as aspartylaspartate and glutamylglutamate can be utilized as growth substrates for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and f. nucleatum.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum supports the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis in oxygenated and carbon-dioxide-depleted environments.
AB  == the authors compared the differences in tolerance to oxygen of the anaerobic periodontopathic bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, and explored the possibility that f. nucleatum might be able to support the growth of p. gingivalis in aerated and co2-depleted environments. both micro-organisms were grown as monocultures and in co-culture in the presence and  absence of co2 and under different aerated conditions using a continuous culture  system. at steady state, viable counts were performed and the activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase and nadh oxidase/peroxidase were assayed in p. gingivalis. in co-culture, f. nucleatum was able to support the growth of p. gingivalis in aerated and co2-depleted environments in which p. gingivalis, as a  monoculture, was not able to survive. f. nucleatum not only appeared to have a much higher tolerance to oxygen than p. gingivalis, but a significant increase in its numbers occurred under moderately oxygenated conditions. f. nucleatum might have an additional indirect role in dental plaque maturation, contributing to the reducing conditions necessary for the survival of p. gingivalis and possibly other anaerobes less tolerant to oxygen. additionally, f. nucleatum is able to generate a capnophilic environment essential for the growth of p. gingivalis.

TI  == [a comparative study of various evaluation methods of the antibiotic sensitivity  of strict anaerobic bacteria of the subgingival flora].
AB  == the study on the sensitiveness of slow-growing anaerobes bacteria to antibiotics  is delicate when you consider the technical motives that make it difficult to transpose the standard methods frequently used in microbiological laboratories. the three main methods used to determine susceptibility to antibiotics are: disk-diffusion test, antibiotics containing microdilution plates and atb ana (biomerieux). the aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of each of these methods on severe anaerobes bacteria isolated in sub-gingival flora of patients suffering from developing periodontitis (rapidly progressive periodontitis, refractory periodontitis, active stage of adult chronic periodontitis). the observed bacteria are: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros. antibiotics used are: ampicilline, amoxicilline, tetracycline, erythromycine, metronidazole. the comparison of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (m.i.c) of each of these methods has permitted to show a strict correlation in the results observed with these three methods, if only the growth  of the severe anaerobes bacteria on agar medium does not exceed 72 hours.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic  pathogens. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of  four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (ah26, ah plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (n2), and one calcium hydroxide-based  sealer (sealapex). the testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. all the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial  activity. the sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types  and bacterial strains. n2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. the extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.

TI  == associations between serum antibody levels to periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == background: the role of antibodies to periodontal microorganisms in the development of periodontal tissue destruction is still unclear. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum levels of igg, iga, and igm antibodies to 6 periodontal microorganisms and clinical subtypes of varying severity of early-onset periodontitis (eop) in young african american adults. methods: the study group consisted of 159 african americans aged 19 to 25 years (mean 22 years) and included 97 cases with eop and 62 controls with no clinical signs of eop. these subjects were selected from a nationally representative sample of adolescents who received an oral examination as part of the national survey of oral health of united states children in 1986-1987. the group was examined clinically a second time 6 years later and blood samples were collected. serum levels of igg, iga, and igm reactive to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum were assessed. results: serum levels of igg and iga antibody reactive to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans and iga antibody to p. intermedia were significantly higher in generalized eop cases compared to healthy controls. igm antibody levels did not show any significant associations with eop for any of the 6 bacterial species tested. there were no significant differences in antibody levels between  controls and the 13 subjects in our study who were classified with localized eop. conclusions: the findings suggest that antibodies to p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of eop. substantial longitudinal studies that monitor antibody levels and avidity prior to disease onset, during progression, and following clinical intervention will be necessary to fully understand the role of this component of the immune response in protection versus tissue destruction and the  potential use in eop risk assessment and disease management.

TI  == lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga ochracea are antagonists for human toll-like receptor 4.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) 2 and 4 have recently been identified as possible signal transducers for various bacterial ligands. to investigate the roles of tlrs in the recognition of periodontopathic bacteria by the innate immune system, a chinese hamster ovary (cho) nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab)-dependent reporter cell line, 7.7, which is defective in both tlr2- and tlr4-dependent signaling pathways was transfected with human cd14 and tlrs. when the transfectants were exposed to freeze-dried periodontopathic bacteria, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, and fusobacterium nucleatum, and a non-oral bacterium, escherichia coli, all species of the bacteria induced nf-kappab-dependent cd25 expression in  7.7/hutlr2 cells. although freeze-dried a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, freeze-dried p. gingivalis did not. similarly, lipopolysaccharides (lps) extracted from a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, but lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea did not. furthermore, lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea attenuated cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells induced by repurified lps from e. coli. lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (il-6) from u373 cells, the secretion of il-1beta from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and icam-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts induced by repurified lps from e. coli. these findings indicated that lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea worked as antagonists for human tlr4. the antagonistic activity of lps from these periodontopathic bacteria may be associated with the etiology of periodontal diseases.

TI  == supragingival and subgingival microbiota of adult patients with down's syndrome.  changes after periodontal treatment.
AB  == in this longitudinal study, five adult down's syndrome patients with periodontitis were placed on a frequent recall visit schedule (every 6 weeks) after treatment, in order to investigate: 1) the microbiological status, both supragingivally and subgingivally, and the changes that occurred after treatment  and 2) the effect of frequent professional supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota and clinical variables in these patients. the clinical variables recorded were probing pocket depth, probing attachment level, bleeding  on probing and presence of plaque (full mouth, six surfaces per tooth). microbiological examination was performed separately for supragingival and subgingival samples from the same site for 14 species, using whole genomic dna probes and the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique. the findings indicate that, although a reduction of periodontal indices was noticed, plaque levels remained high (60%) even at the end of the experimental period. periodontal pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently detected both supragingivally and subgingivally (>30%). the presence of a species supragingivally and the presence at the same time points subgingivally were correlated. this finding suggested that supragingival plaque acts as a reservoir  for reinfection of treated sites. a reduction of the percentages of detection of  these species was noticed 1 month after an oral hygiene period as well as at 3 and 6 months after treatment. inadequate oral hygiene as performed by these patients probably affected supragingival, and consequently subgingival, plaque composition.

TI  == prior exposure of mice to fusobacterium nucleatum modulates host response to porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == multiple periodontal pathogens sequentially colonize the subgingival niche during the conversion from gingivitis to destructive periodontal disease. an animal model of sequential immunization with key periodontal pathogens has been developed to determine whether t- and b-lymphocyte effector functions are skewed  and fail to protect the host from pathogenic challenge. the present study was performed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of exposure to fusobacterium nucleatum prior to porphyromonas gingivalis. group 1 (control) mice were immunized with phosphate-buffered saline, group 2 were immunized with f. nucleatum prior to p. gingivalis and group 3 were immunized with p. gingivalis alone. all the t-cell clones derived from group 2 demonstrated type 2 helper t-cell clone (th2 subsets), whereas those from group 3 mice demonstrated th1 subsets. exposure of mice to f. nucleatum prior to p. gingivalis interfered with  the opsonophagocytosis function of sera against p. gingivalis. in adoptive t-cell transfer experiments, in vivo protective capacity of type 2 helper t-cell clones  (th2) from group 2 was significantly lower than type 1 helper t-cell clones (th1) from group 3 against the lethal dose infection of p. gingivalis. western blot analysis indicated a different pattern of recognition of p. gingivalis fimbrial proteins between sera from group 2 and group 3. in conclusion, these studies suggest that exposure of a host to f. nucleatum prior to the periodontal pathogen p. gingivalis modulates the host immune responses to p. gingivalis at the humoral, cellular and molecular levels.

TI  == intra- and interspecies regulation of gene expression by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans luxs.
AB  == the cell density-dependent control of gene expression is employed by many bacteria for regulating a variety of physiological functions, including the generation of bioluminescence, sporulation, formation of biofilms, and the expression of virulence factors. although periodontal organisms do not appear to  secrete acyl-homoserine lactone signals, several species, e.g., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been shown to secrete a signal related to the autoinducer ii (ai-2) of the signal system 2 pathway in vibrio harveyi. here, we report that the periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans expresses a homolog of v. harveyi luxs and secretes an ai-2-like signal. cell-free conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from a recombinant escherichia coli strain (e. coli ais) expressing a. actinomycetemcomitans luxs induced luminescence in v. harveyi bb170 >200-fold over controls. ai-2 levels peaked in mid-exponential-phase cultures of  a. actinomycetemcomitans and were significantly reduced in late-log- and stationary-phase cultures. incubation of early-log-phase a. actinomycetemcomitans cells with conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from e. coli ais resulted in a threefold induction of leukotoxic activity and a concomitant increase in leukotoxin polypeptide. in contrast, no increase in leukotoxin expression occurred when cells were exposed to sterile medium or to conditioned broth from e. coli ais(-), a recombinant strain in which luxs was insertionally inactivated. a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 also induced expression of afua, encoding a periplasmic iron transport protein, approximately eightfold, suggesting that luxs-dependent signaling may play a role in the regulation of iron acquisition by a. actinomycetemcomitans. finally, a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 added in trans complemented a luxs knockout mutation in p. gingivalis by modulating the expression of the luxs-regulated genes uvrb and hasf in this organism. together, these results suggest that luxs-dependent signaling may modulate aspects of virulence and the uptake of iron by a. actinomycetemcomitans  and induce responses in other periodontal organisms in mixed-species oral biofilm.

TI  == absence of a specific subgingival microflora in adults with down's syndrome.
AB  == background: periodontal disease in down's syndrome (ds) is generally characterized by a high degree of bone loss. bone loss of 5 mm or more is observed in 70% of these subjects. among ds subjects, considerable differences in disease progression occur. so far, no studies have been conducted in which specific properties of the subgingival microflora have been related to the condition observed. aims: to investigate (1) the subgingival microflora in ds subjects and other mentally retarded (control) individuals which were matched to  the utmost and (2) to investigate the subgingival microflora of a "low-risk" and  a " high-risk" group formed in ds subjects. material and methods: 17 ds subjects  and 17 control subjects were matched with respect to age, plaque level and bleeding on probing. in addition, the ds group was divided in a "low-risk" group  (0-2 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=6) and a "high-risk"group (6-13 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=11). prevalence and proportions of the putative periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus in the subgingival plaque were determined using anaerobic culture techniques. no differences in the prevalence of distinct suspected periodontopathic bacteria and bacterial subgingival composition between the ds group and the control group could be established. also no differences in the prevalence of the seven investigated microbial species between the "low-risk" and the "high-risk" group were observed. conclusions: because of the lack of differences in microflora between the ds group and the control group, a specific effect of the microbiological composition in the periodontal status of subjects with ds can be  excluded in this population. host factors constitute the more likely explanation  of the differences observed in ds.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

AB  == aims: to develop a semi-quantitative method for evaluating co-aggregation reactions among three bacterial species, and to examine the influence of fusobacterium nucleatum on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis. methods and results: the method involves coating hydroxyapatite (hap) discs with streptococcal cells and treatment with radio-labelled bacterial cell suspensions. the sensitivity of the method was estimated by comparison with a turbidometric co-aggregation assay. results from the two methods were in close agreement. streptococcus mitis-coated hap discs were immersed in a 3h-labelled fus. nucleatum cell suspension and then a 14c-labelled p. gingivalis cell suspension.  the discs were then pyrolysed to recover and quantify the released 3h and 14c radioactivity. the number of fus. nucleatum cells on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. conclusion: the data indicate that the method closely reflects co-aggregation characters, and that fus. nucleatum has a positive effect on the adherence of p. gingivalis. significance and impact of the study: the present method, which is designed to mimic the oral environment, should prove useful in the semi-quantitative evaluation of co-aggregation reactions.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (no) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. the aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through no production, on the periodontal disease pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. whereas the growth of these organisms was inhibited by a more acid ph, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after exposure. the ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also affected by ph and nitrite concentration. at acidity levels below ph 5.0, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mm) caused effective complete killing of the periodontal bacteria. addition of sodium thiocyanate did not increase the bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal activity of acidified nitrite against any of the  3 bacteria. these results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva, under appropriate conditions, may have an effect on the growth and survival of the bacteria implicated in periodontal disease.

TI  == mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  == background: the etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. this implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. however, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. objective: to investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. the subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans  streptococci. this localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. materials and methods:  in this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. these patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. results: the prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. the mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). conclusions: the subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.

TI  == untreated periodontal disease in indonesian adolescents. subgingival microbiota in relation to experienced progression of periodontitis.
AB  == background/aims: in an indonesian population deprived of regular dental care, the experienced progression of disease between baseline (1987) and follow-up (1994) was investigated in relation to the composition of the subgingival microbiota at  follow-up. at baseline the age ranged from 15 to 25 years. clinical and microbiological evaluation was completed in 158 of the 167 subjects available at  follow-up. methods: plaque index (pi), pocket depth (pd), bleeding on probing (bop), and attachment loss (al) were scored at the approximal surfaces of all teeth and subgingival calculus on the approximal surfaces of the ramfjord teeth only (number of sites with subgingival calculus: nsc). a pooled sample of the deepest pocket in each quadrant was evaluated using microbiological culture techniques. results: at baseline the mean values of the clinical parameters were  al=0.35 mm, pi=1.01, bop=0.80 pd=3.25 mm and nsc=6.04 and at follow-up al=0.75 mm, pi=1.16, bop=1.19, pd=3.34 mm and nsc=5.85. all parameters except pd and nsc  showed a statistically significant increase. at follow-up the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 40%, of porphyromonas gingivalis 67%, of prevotella intermedia 66%, of fusobacterium nucleatum 79%, of bacteroides forsythus 16%, of campylobacter rectus 4%, and of p. micros 6%. no differences in clinical parameters were found between groups with or without these micro-organisms. in 129 subjects al of > or =2 mm at > or =1 site was found. logistic regression showed three significant odds-ratio's for experienced progressive periodontitis: plaque index (12.2), gender (3.4) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2.9). conclusions: the results of this retrospective study suggest that plaque is the most important parameter related to experienced disease progression, and that the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans may be associated with increased chance of disease progression.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == smoking affects the subgingival microflora in periodontitis.
AB  == background: tobacco smoking has been identified as one major risk factor for destructive periodontal disease. scaling and root planing have been shown to be less effective in smokers with periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare the subgingival microbial flora of treated and untreated smokers and non-smokers. methods: four independent adult patient groups with periodontitis were included in this investigation: 88 untreated smokers (u-s); 90 untreated non-smokers (u-ns); 119 treated non-smokers (t-ns); and 171 treated smokers (t-s). clinical variables included cumulative plaque index (cpi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), cumulative bleeding index (cbi), and cumulative suppuration index (csi). paper point samples from the deepest bleeding pocket in each quadrant of the dentition were analyzed for the presence and levels of 6 periodontal bacterial pathogens using anaerobic culture techniques. results: u-s showed a higher mean cumulative plaque index than u-ns (3.5 versus 2.7). mean pd and mean cal were higher in the t-s in comparison to the t-ns group (7.0 versus 6.6 mm and 5.6 versus 4.7 mm, respectively). microbiological characteristics of u-s were a higher prevalence of prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and higher mean levels of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). t-s patients were characterized by higher prevalence of bacteroides forsythus (bf), pm, and campylobacter rectus (cr) and higher mean levels of pm and fn. the mean percentage of b. forsythus tended to be higher in the t-s group than in the t-ns group (6.9% versus 5.6%). the relative risk to be infected with bf, pm, and cr was statistically higher in smokers (odds ratios: 1.9, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively). the chance to find > or =10% of bf, pm, and/or fn was 3.3 higher in smokers when a. actinomycetemcomitans and p gingivalis were absent. detection of > or =20% pm/fn in treated patients was strongly associated with smoking (odds ratio 13.8, p= 0.002). conclusions: smoking is a determining factor for the composition of the subgingival microflora in adult patients with periodontitis and may select for a specific cluster of periodontal pathogens, notably bf, pm, fn, and cr. on the basis of these observations, smoking, among other criteria, may be one parameter to use in deciding to treat refractory periodontitis in smokers with a systemic antibiotic  therapy directed against smoking-associated periodontal bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of particulate bioglass against supra- and subgingival bacteria.
AB  == particulate bioglass is a bioactive material used in the repair of periodontal defects. this material undergoes a series of surface reactions in an aqueous environment which lead to osseointegration. the aim of this study was to determine whether these reactions exerted an antibacterial effect on a range of oral bacteria. streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus were suspended in nutrient broth (nb), artificial saliva (as) or dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% foetal calf serum (dmem + 10%fcs), with or without particulate bioglass. all bacteria showed reduced viability following  exposure to bioglass in all the media after 1 h. this antibacterial effect increased after 3 h. porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were suspended in  either bm broth or 40% horse serum (hs) in rpmi. a considerable reduction in viability was observed with all bacteria tested, in both media, compared to inert glass controls. in further experiments it was found that the viability of s. sanguis was significantly reduced following exposure to nb pre-incubated with bioglass. additionally, it was found that neutralisation of this highly alkaline  solution eliminated the antibacterial effect. moreover, a solution of nb and naoh (of equivalent ph) exerted an antibacterial effect of similar magnitude to that of the solution pre-incubated with bioglass. thus, particulate bioglass exerts an antibacterial effect on certain oral bacteria, possibly by virtue of the alkaline nature of its surface reactions. this may reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo.

AB  == the essential oil of melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil) exhibits antimicrobial activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. in this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal/fungicidal activity of a tea tree oil solution, of a new tea tree oil (tebodont) and the respective placebo-gel, of a chlorhexidindigluconate-solution and of plakout was tested in vitro against ten different oral microorganisms. minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from 0.0293% to 1.25% for the tea tree oil solution and from 0.0082% to 1.25% for the tea tree oil gel. the values for minimum bacteriocidal/fungicidal concentrations were in the range from 0.0521% to 2.5% for the tea tree oil solution and from <0.0098% to 3.33% for the tea tree oil gel. the most susceptible microorganisms were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis, whereas streptococcus mutans and prevotella intermedia were the least susceptible ones. both for the chlorhexidindigluconate solution and for plakout the values for the minimal inhibitory concentration and for the minimal cidal concentration  were between <0.0002% and 0.0125%.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in primary sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == objective: knowledge of the effect of primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) on the microbial flora in the different predilection sites for oral disorders is needed  for planning preventive treatment. we carried out microbial analysis of samples from the dorsum of the tongue, smooth mucosa, supragingival tooth surfaces, and the gingival crevice region of 20 patients with pss. methods: a clinical oral examination was performed and whole unstimulated and stimulated secretion rates were measured. results: compared with healthy controls, subjects with pss harbored higher numbers and frequencies of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans in the supragingival plaque. on the smooth mucosa and  tongue, the pss subjects displayed an increased frequency of c. albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics, and enterococci. c. albicans was detected about  twice as frequently in the supragingival plaque as it was on the tongue. in the gingival crevice region, the pss group harbored slightly lower proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens than controls. the clinical and microbial differences were mainly due to the pss subjects with a stimulated secretion rate of < 0.5 ml/min. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any subject with pss. conclusion: the microbial flora in the different ecosystems reflected the status of oral disorders in the subjects with pss. specific site sampling and analysis in subjects with pss revealed further differences compared  with controls, and is therefore preferable to saliva sampling for oral treatment  planning and for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatment and of preventive measures implemented in individuals with pss.

TI  == relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background: the relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. method: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. results: greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. members of the orange and red complexes including e. nodatum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, p. intermedia, p. micros, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly more  prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. the difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). the difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. conclusions: the major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking  history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. the greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.

TI  == heterogeneity of host immunological risk factors in patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the pathogenesis of early-onset periodontitis (eop) can be explained  by various host risk factors. previous studies have focused on a single (among many possible) immunological risk factor and the association among the factors has not been assessed. we comprehensively investigated the associations among multiple host immunological risk factors in eop patients to further elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of eop. methods: sixty-eight eop patients (50 generalized eop, 18 localized eop), 51 eop-suspected patients (s-eop), 43 adult periodontitis (ap) patients, and 36 periodontally healthy subjects (hs) participated in this cross-sectional study. we examined peripheral neutrophil functions, phenotypic and functional characterization of peripheral lymphocytes (lymphocyte subsets, t-cell proliferative activity), cytokine productivity (interleukin [il]-1, il-2, tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-alpha, interferon [ifn]-gamma, il-4 and il-6), serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody titers against 12 periodontal bacteria, and hla class ii genotypes. results: g-eop, s-eop, and ap patient groups showed significantly lower percentages of pan t cells and cd8-positive cells (p < 0.02) compared with the hs group. l-eop patients showed depressed il-4 and tnf-alpha productivity compared with the hs group (p < 0.02).  the eop group showed significantly elevated antibody levels against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and fusobacterium nucleatum compared with the hs group (p < 0.05). the frequency with dqb1*0503 was significantly higher in the eop patient group than the hs group (p = 0.045) due to the higher frequency in l-eop patients than the hs group (p = 0.035). there were wide interindividual variations in each of the tests among patient and hs groups; however, eop patients showed wider intradiagnostic group variations in certain host defensive cell functions than the other groups. there were some eop patients who showed extremely low or high values in some tests; the eop patients could be further divided into subgroups according to their host defensive and immunological profiles. however, there was  heterogeneity in some of the other host immunological tests even in the subgroups. conclusions: the association of host immunological risk factors in eop patients is widely varied and more complex than previously thought. these results indicate the difficulty of explaining the pathogenesis of eop based on a single host risk factor and also emphasize the importance of critical assessment of not  only eop patient groups, but also individual patients.

TI  == [bacterial virulence in the etiology of periodontal diseases].
AB  == strong relationships have been very often described between various form of periodontal disease (pd) and certain bacterial species, so that nowadays periodontal disease is recognized as an infectious disease. destruction of periodontal supporting tissues happens as a response to very intricate host-parasite interactions. when the clinician will be able to fully understand and identify such phenomena it would be possible to succeed in a properly diagnosis and control of the active phase of periodontal disease. the first step  in such a direction would be to analyze the common characteristic of some bacterial species, the so called suspected periodontopathogens. such species namely gram-negative, associated with the outbreak of periodontal disease have in common the capacity to disrupt the integrity of the host defences by means of the so called virulence factors. these factors may enhance the bacterial colonization or may interfere with the host response that ultimately results in periodontal support breakdown. the present review focuses on the virulence factors of the main suspected periodontopathogens evaluating the effects on the host immune response and directly on the periodontal tissues.

TI  == effect of lipopolysaccharide from periodontal pathogens on the production of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 by human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == both tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (pai-2) are important proteolysis factors present in inflamed human periodontal tissues. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (lps) on the synthesis of t-pa and pai-2 by human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). lps from different periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum were extracted by the hot phenol water method. the levels of t-pa and pai-2 secreted into the cell culture media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa). the mrna for t-pa and pai-2 were measured by rt-pcr. the results showed t-pa synthesis was increased in response to all types  of lps studied and pai-2 level was increased by lps from a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, but not p. gingivalis. when comparing the effects of lps from non-periodontal bacteria (escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis) with the lps from periodontal pathogens, we found that the ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was greater following exposure of the cells to lps from periodontal pathogens. the highest ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was found in those cells exposed to lps from p. gingivalis. these results indicate that lps derived from periodontal pathogens may cause unbalanced regulation of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor by hgf and such an effect may, in part, contribute to the destruction of periodontal connective tissue through dysregulated pericellular proteolysis.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == anaerobic bacterial extracts influence production of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors by human dental pulp cells.
AB  == the role of human dental pulp (hdp) cells in extracellular matrix degradation in  pulpitis is still unclear. in this study, the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (sbes) from prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis on the balance between the production of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and that of their inhibitors [tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (timps)] by hdp cells were examined. hdp cells were treated with sbes, and their culture media were later harvested. mmp activities and timp concentrations were determined by use of independent measurement strategies and sensitive elisas. the production of mmp-1 and mmp-2 was accelerated by all sbe. on the other hand, timp-1 production was slightly elevated; and timp-2 production was markedly inhibited by all of the extracts. sbes derived from these anaerobic bacteria seemed to affect the acceleration of extracellular matrix degradation activity by hdp cells. these findings suggest that hdp cells stimulated by bacterial byproducts may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulpitis.

TI  == the sensitivity of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum to different (pseudo)halide-peroxidase combinations compared with mutans streptococci.
AB  == previous studies have shown that the peroxidase system with iodide is particularly effective against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in the present study, the effects of iodide, chloride and thiocyanate in combinations with lactoperoxidase (lp) and myeloperoxidase (mp) on the viability of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans and s. rattus were analysed. bacteria were incubated in buffer solution containing peroxidase, substrate(s) and h2o2 (all in oral physiological concentrations), and plated after 0, 0.5 and 1 h. the oxidation product of iodide was the most bactericidal against all the bacteria tested. the effect was significantly weaker on mutans streptococci. physiological concentrations of thiocyanate abolished the effects of lp-h2o2-iodide and mp-h2o2-iodide/chloride combinations. thiocyanate-peroxidase systems have already been used in oral hygiene products. the incorporation of iodide into these products could make them much more potent  against periodontal pathogens, and also help to prevent transmission of these pathogens from person to person via saliva.

TI  == interleukin-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 regulation in oral epithelial cells by selected periodontal bacteria: multiple effects of porphyromonas gingivalis via antagonistic mechanisms.
AB  == interaction of bacteria with mucosal surfaces can modulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules produced by epithelial cells. previously, we showed that expression of interleukin-8 (il-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) by gingival epithelial cells increases following interaction with several putative periodontal pathogens. in contrast, expression  of il-8 and icam-1 is reduced after porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 challenge. in the present study, we investigated the mechanisms that govern the regulation of these two molecules in bacterially infected gingival epithelial cells. experimental approaches included bacterial stimulation of gingival epithelial cells by either a brief challenge (1.5 to 2 h) or a continuous coculture throughout the incubation period. the kinetics of il-8 and icam-1 expression following brief challenge were such that (i) secretion of il-8 by gingival epithelial cells reached its peak 2 h following fusobacterium nucleatum  infection whereas it rapidly decreased within 2 h after p. gingivalis infection and remained decreased up to 30 h and (ii) il-8 and icam-1 mrna levels were up-regulated rapidly 2 to 4 h postinfection and then decreased to basal levels 8  to 20 h after infection with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, or p. gingivalis. attenuation of il-8 secretion was facilitated by adherent p. gingivalis strains. the il-8 secreted from epithelial cells after f.  nucleatum stimulation could be down-regulated by subsequent infection with p. gingivalis or its culture supernatant. although these results suggested that il-8 attenuation at the protein level might be associated with p. gingivalis proteases, the arg- and lys-gingipain proteases did not appear to be solely responsible for il-8 attenuation. in addition, while p. gingivalis up-regulated il-8 mrna expression, this effect was overridden when the bacteria were continuously cocultured with the epithelial cells. the il-8 mrna levels in epithelial cells following sequential challenge with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum and vice versa were approximately identical and were lower than those following f. nucleatum challenge alone and higher than control levels or those following p. gingivalis challenge alone. thus, together with the protease effect, p. gingivalis possesses a powerful strategy to ensure the down-regulation of il-8 and icam-1.

TI  == early colonization of dental implants by putative periodontal pathogens in partially edentulous patients.
AB  == there is limited scientific information available on the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets in partially edentulous individuals. knowledge about this process is one step in better understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of peri-implantitis. in this study, the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets by putative periodontal pathogens was studied in 20 partially edentulous  individuals using anaerobic culture techniques. at baseline, the presence and levels of putative periodontal pathogens in the microflora of periodontal pockets and saliva were established. immediately after loading of the titanium implants and after 6 and 12 months the presence and levels of selected putative periodontal pathogens were determined in periodontal and peri-implant pockets. a  second aim was to detect bacterial contamination of the implant site and the inside of the implant. at baseline, the most frequently isolated species from the periodontal pockets were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros. bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were isolated from 9, 2 and 3  patients respectively. six months after placing of the bridges, the majority of the implant sites had detectable levels of most periodontal bacterial species with the exception of a. actinomycetemcomitans which could not be isolated from any of the peri-implant samples during the experimental period, although 2 patients had this organism at baseline. in 2 patients with detectable subgingival p. gingivalis at baseline this species was found after 12 months in the peri-implant sites. one of these patients lost 2 implants which was associated with a high proportion of p. gingivalis in the peri-implant pockets. a second patient developed 2 fistulas around 2 implants at 8 months and this event was also associated with the presence of p. gingivalis. it is concluded that proper periodontal infection control before installment of dental implants in partially  edentulous patients may prevent early bacterial complications.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis platelet aggregation activity: outer membrane vesicles are potent activators of murine platelets.
AB  == recent evidence has established an association between chronic periodontitis and  cardiovascular disease. periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a small group of gram-negative bacteria, of which porphyromonas gingivalis is considered an important causative agent. it has been proposed that dental plaque  bacteria and their products can disseminate into the bloodstream from the site of infection and promote thromboembolic events associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. in this regard, streptococcus sanguis and p. gingivalis have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. here we report that p. gingivalis was able to induce platelet aggregation, and that oral strains of actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and trepenoma denticola failed to  aggregate platelets when tested for platelet aggregation activity under similar conditions. additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of p. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse platelet aggregation in vitro. in summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by p. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) p. gingivalis vesicles possess platelet aggregation-inducing activity.

TI  == polarization of porphyromonas gingivalis-specific helper t-cell subsets by prior  immunization with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == antigen-specific t-cell clones were obtained from mice immunized with fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 and/or porphyromonas gingivalis 381. 10 balb/c mice per group were immunized with f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis, or with p. gingivalis alone by intraperitoneal injection of viable microorganisms. spleen t cells were isolated and stimulated in vitro with viable p. gingivalis cells to establish p. gingivalis-specific t-cell clones. t-cell phenotypes and cytokine profiles were determined along with t-cell responsiveness to f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis. serum immunoglobulin g antibody titers to f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis were also determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. all the t-cell clones derived from mice immunized with f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis demonstrated th2 subsets, while those from mice immunized with p. gingivalis alone demonstrated th1 subsets based on the flow cytometric analysis and cytokine profiles. all t-cell clones from both groups were cross-reactive to both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum antigens. phenotypes of t-cell clones were all positive for cd4. mean post-immune serum igg antibody levels to f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis were significantly higher than the pre-immune levels (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively). there were no significant differences in the antibody titers between the two groups. it was concluded that  p. gingivalis-specific t cells initially primed by cross-reactive f. nucleatum antigens were polarized to th2 subset, while t cells stimulated with p. gingivalis alone maintained the profile of th1 subset.

TI  == [clinical use of tetracyclines in the treatment of periodontal diseases].
AB  == introduction: there are a number of chemically different tetracycline homologues. the older group of tetracyclines, which was introduced in the 1950-60s, includes  tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and demeclocycline. the newer group of tetracyclines includes doxycycline, methacycline and minocycline. pharmacokinetics: elevated concentration of tetracycline in gingival fluid with respect to blood levels was an unexpected phenomenon. patients given 250 mg every 6 hours had average crevicular fluid concentrations between 4 to 8 g/ml and blood concentrations between 2 to 2.5 g/ml after 48 hours. the levels in crevicular fluid and blood of volunteers who received 250 mg every 12 hours were 2 to 4 g/ml and 0.3 to 1.4 g/ml respectively after 48 hours. the concentration of doxycycline in gingival fluid after administration of 200 mg/1st day and then 100 mg/day achieved average level of 6 g/ml. minocycline, a semisynthetic derivate of tetracycline, has shown to yield gingival fluid levels 5 times as high as serum levels after administration of 100 mg every 12 hours. mechanisms of action: tetracycline and its derivates demonstrate high in vitro activity against most periodontal bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, wolinella recta and fusobacterium nucleatum. the study of in vitro susceptibility of these  6 bacterial strains showed that, in regard to blood level, minimal inhibitory concentration is higher and it is the concentration of the drug that can be expected in gingival fluid following oral administration of 100 mg per day (doxycycline) (table 1). the anti-inflammatory effect of tetracyclines was demonstrated histologically not only by reducing the size of the infiltrated connective tissue, but qualitative changes were also observed. golub and associates have presented evidence that tetracyclines inhibit collagenase activity in gingival fluid and in tissue cultures. therapeutic concentrations of  tetracycline inhibit chemotaxis, phagocytosis and random migration of neutrophils in vitro. adverse effects: great amounts of tetracyclines cause gastrointestinal  disorders, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. tetracyclines suppress activity of the  enzymes in the bowel and pancreas. during longlasting administration they can damage the liver and kidneys. tetracyclines can cause photo-sensibilization. they make deposits with calcium in bones, specially during prenatal period and during  growth, so they can cause permanent teeth discoloration and hypoplasia. interactions: the most important interaction is with penicillin. these two kinds  of antibiotics antagonize and decrease the therapeutic effect of each other, so their administration at the same time should be avoided. a significant interaction occurs between tetracyclines and metal ions. this interaction often has been observed in conjunction with use of various antacids. tetracyclines can  also influence the production and absorption of vitamin k. nephrotoxicity has been reported when tetracyclines have been administrated in conjunction with methoxyflurane. indications: doxycycline, due to its advantages over tetracycline (table 2), is indicated in treating destructive periodontal diseases including: juvenile periodontitis and refractory marginal periodontitis. doxycycline therapy may be used for acute periodontal abscess and if the conditions are accompanied by general symptoms. prophylactic application is recommended for implant placement procedures including membranes in guided tissue regeneration. results of clinical study: oral application: in spite of great number of published investigations this paper presents only the results of placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. there is evidence that therapy in localized juvenile periodontitis should eliminate actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, since 95% of patients harbored this bacteria.

TI  == photoactive porphyrin derivative with broad-spectrum activity against oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. pdt is a potential adjunct to scaling and root  planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. however, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. we have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. potent  antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of cfu per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. the use  of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == bacterial susceptibility to amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate in advanced periodontitis patients not responding to mechanical therapy.
AB  == background, aims: between 4 and 8% of periodontitis patients are reported to respond poorly to conventional therapy. in these cases, adjunctive use of systemic antibiotics might be a reasonable therapeutic approach. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of systemic amoxicillin/clavulanate as adjunct to periodontal surgery on the predominant subgingival microorganisms in patients not responding to mechanical therapy. furthermore, the bacterial susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanate was analyzed before and after therapy in order to assess the clinical validity of pre-therapeutic susceptibility testing. methods: in 10 periodontitis subjects with no subgingival detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the predominant subgingival organisms were  identified using the identification system rapid id 32 a as well as antibiotic susceptibility was tested utilizing the e test. results: porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella oralis were detected in 7/10 subjects and could no more recovered  after therapy. fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros were present in 5/10 patients before treatment, but could be detected in 6/10, resp. 3/10 after therapy. in 4/10 subjects harboring f. nucleatum and in 3/10 with p. micros, those organisms were not targeted by amoxicillin/clavulanate, although post-treatment testing revealed their alleged susceptibility (mics varied from 0.023 to 0.032 microg/ml, resp. from 0.125 to 2.0 microg/ ml). conclusions: the results of this study suggest that the outcomes of conventional methods of susceptibility testing have to be interpreted very carefully when being used for  treatment of plaque-related diseases. furthermore, since the endpoint of systemic antibiotic treatment as adjunct to conventional therapy is elimination of f. nucleatum or p. micros in patients harboring these organisms, the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate appears not to be justified.

TI  == microbiological parameters associated with il-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  == background, aims: polymorphisms in the cluster of il-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in il-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. method: the study included 108 subjects in good general health. clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of  up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. fingerstick blood samples were collected for il-1a (+4845) and il-1b (+3954) genotyping using pcr-based methods. results: the proportion of  il-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola,  the fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, fusobacterium periodonticum, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter showae and streptococcus constellatus. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus gordonii and 3 capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. significantly higher mean counts of b. forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, the f. nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum, campylobacter rectus, c. showae, eubacterium nodatum, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius  were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. the increase was due to increased  numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. conclusion: the data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had  higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == differences in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of two periodontitis populations of different geographical origin. a comparison between spain and the  netherlands.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the subgingival microbiota of two geographically distinct patient populations using identical clinical and bacteriological methods. adult patients with a diagnosis of periodontitis were consecutively selected according to pre-defined clinical criteria. microbiological samples were taken from the deepest four sites with bleeding. the samples were plated on blood agar plates, for the determination of the total anaerobic counts and identification of specific bacterial pathogens, and on tsbv  and mcconkey for isolation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods, respectively. thirty-one patients in spain and 30 patients in the netherlands were selected. both patient groups showed similar clinical characteristics, both in terms of age, gender and periodontal clinical variables. a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent (23.3% vs. 3.2%) in the dutch group, while porphyromonas gingivalis was significantly more prevalent (64.5% vs. 36.7%) in the spanish group. bacteroides forsythus and most commensal  periodontal pathogens showed similar prevalences, except peptostreptococcus micros that was significantly more frequent in the dutch group (96.7% vs. 74.2%). in summary, the subgingival microbiota from the spanish group was characterised by a high prevalence of p. gingivalis and low of a. actinomycetemcomitans, while  the flora from the dutch group was characterised by a high prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. micros.

AB  == background: although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a korean population so far. the purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in korean patients by culture-independent methods. methods: a total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken  from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. ap samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [pd]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm pd) in each patient. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. aliquots of pcr products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. results: all diseased sites harbored fusobacterium sp., while porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema sp., and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. peptostreptococcus micros, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. in  sites of periodontally healthy subjects, fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). treponema sp., p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. p. micros, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy  sites, respectively. the prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (p <0.05). conclusions: using highly sensitive methods relying on 16s ribosomal rna-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with ap patients in a korean population. with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.

TI  == identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  == background: subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm  formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free  zone"(pfz). methods: seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. results: secondary electron images showed  that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the pfz. some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. by back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-p. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. labeled cells with anti-c. rectus, anti-t.  denticola and anti-p. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. a. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. a. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. conclusions: these findings indicated that p. gingivalis, c. rectus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and a. viscosus were present in the pfz, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum involvement in adult periodontitis and possible modification of strain classification.
AB  == background: this investigation was designed to evaluate the involvement of fusobacterium nucleatum clinical strains in adult periodontitis by subspecies and expression of hemagglutination activity. methods: forty-nine fusobacterium strains were isolated from 40 sites in 40 subjects presenting with adult periodontitis. f. nucleatum subspecies identification was based on the electrophoretic migration of glutamate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate reductase. hemagglutination activity and inhibition by galactose were tested on sheep erythrocytes. results: the 49 isolates belonged to the f. nucleatum species with a predominance of the nucleatum (34.7%) followed by the vincentii (26.5%) subspecies. in parallel, 71% of the strains belonging to the nucleatum subspecies were preferentially associated with porphyromonas gingivalis. prevotella intermedia/nigrescens detection was essentially correlated with identification of fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies vincentii. no correlation was established between any particular subspecies and the pathogenicity factors tested (hemagglutination and production of short-chain fatty acids). on the other hand,  significant predominance (65%, p= 0.017) of strongly hemagglutinating strains (titre > or =8 u) was observed in the sites where porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and/or campylobacter rectus were not detected. these strains also showed higher butyric acid production. conclusion: the importance of the adherence factors for fusobacterium nucleatum strains and their multimodal aspect may indicate a higher pathogenicity or a higher involvement of  certain strains and could lead to a classification of these strains, which is more closely related to their implication in the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == enhanced interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by lps stimulated human monocytes isolated from hiv+ patients.
AB  == periodontal disease and tooth loss is a common finding among advanced hiv+ patients. in addition to local oral lipopolysaccharide (lps) stimulation, systemic up-regulation of monocyte pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion may also be involved in the pathogenesis of hiv disease. a study was undertaken to investigate il-1beta, il-6 and tnf-alpha production by resting and lps stimulated monocytes isolated from hiv+ patients and also to investigate the relationship of the patient's hiv viral load status to the cytokine production. whole blood samples in edta were collected from 39 hiv-1 infected patients and 20 age and sex matched uninfected controls. plasma was separated by centrifugation. viral load was determined using a quantitative rt-pcr. monocytes were isolated by ficoll-hypaque gradient separation followed by overnight plastic adherence. cultured monocytes (1x10(6)/ml) were stimulated with lps (1 microg/ml) of either  p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum for 2, 8, 24 and 48 h and supernatant fluids were collected. il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha levels in supernatant fluids were estimated by elisa. increased overall production of il-1beta, il-6 and tnf-alpha  by lps stimulated monocytes isolated from hiv-1 infected patients was observed when compared to hiv-1 uninfected controls. lps stimulated monocytes from hiv-1 infected patients with high viral load (hvl) produced significant (p<0.05) elevations in these pro-inflammatory cytokines when compared to hiv-1 uninfected  controls. both lps of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum produced a comparable cytokine production by monocytes after 8 h of stimulation. these data suggest that enhanced il-1beta, il-6 and tnf-alpha is produced by monocytes/macrophages isolated from hvl hiv+ patients and may be involved in the overall pathogenesis of hiv-1 infection.

TI  == tetracycline fibres used to control bacterial infection during guided tissue regeneration (gtr).
AB  == aims: the colonization of suspected periodontal pathogens during the healing of periodontal defects treated by guided tissue regeneration (gtr) with e-ptfe membranes and tetracycline fibers was investigated. methods: fifteen patients, each with one pair of angular periodontal bone defects of comparable size and morphology were recruited for the study. in a matched-pair study design, the test defects were treated with e-ptfe membranes in combination with tetracycline fibers, while control defects were treated with e-ptfe membranes alone. microbiological specimens were taken from control as well as from test sites preoperatively (t0), intraoperatively (t1), two weeks after surgery (t2) and from membranes at time of removal (t3). cultural methods were used to identify the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and actinobacillus actinomicetemcomitans (aa). results: at baseline and t1, none of the suspected periodontal pathogens were detected at test or control sites. levels of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum, as mean percentages of total culturable microflora, were detected at levels significantly higher in control sites than test sites at times t2 and t3. conclusions: findings from this study suggest that e-ptfe membranes are frequently colonized by periodontal pathogens, and that bacterial colonization of healing sites after gtr procedures can be kept under control with a controlled delivery system releasing tetracycline.

AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

TI  == interleukin-1 receptor signaling rather than that of tumor necrosis factor is critical in protecting the host from the severe consequences of a polymicrobe anaerobic infection.
AB  == infection of the dental pulp leads to an osteolytic lesion that results from a polymicrobial infection consisting largely of pathogenic anaerobes. infection causes significant morbidity and mortality mediated by bacterial factors and in some cases by the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), in particular, play a complex and central role in the responses to microbial pathogens. however, relatively little is known about the significance of these cytokines in protecting the host from focal polymicrobial anaerobic infections. to establish the relative importance of il-1 and tnf in mediating the response to a mixed anaerobic infection, we inoculated the dental pulp of mice with six anaerobic pathogens containing functional deletions of receptors to il-1 (il-1r1(-/-)), tnf (tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-)), or both (tnfrp55(-/-)-il-1ri(-/-)). the results indicate that il-1 receptor signaling and tnf receptor signaling both play similarly important roles in protecting the host from local tissue damage. however, il-1 receptor signaling is considerably more important than tnf receptor signaling in  preventing the spread of infection into surrounding fascial planes, since il-1r1(-/-) but not tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher morbidity and mortality. moreover, all of the fatal infections occurred in male mice, suggesting the importance of gender differences in limiting the impact of these infections.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among 149 anaerobic gram-negative  rods isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == in a prospective study, 47 adults presenting a rapidly progressive periodontitis  were selected in order to evaluate the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among oral anaerobic gram-negative rods. predominant anaerobes were identified from two of the deepest periodontal pockets. beta-lactamase-positive strains fulfilled to at least two of three criteria: positive nitrocefin test, penicillin etest minimal inhibitory concentration > 1 microgram/ml, and disk diffusion synergy between amoxycillin and clavulanic acid > 10 mm. at least one beta-lactamase-producing strain was found in 53.2% of patients and 39.4% of the periodontal pockets investigated. prominent beta-lactamase-positive species were  prevotella buccae and prevotella intermedia (respectively 16 of 38: 42% and 18 of 52: 35% positive strains), followed by prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum (respectively 1 of 6: 17%, 1 of  10: 10%, 1 of 10: 10%, and 1 of 13: 8% positive strains). no beta-lactamase producer could be evidenced in porphyromonas gingivalis (10 strains tested). all  the beta-lactamase-positive strains with the nitrocefin test had penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations > 1 microgram/ml with the etest, and a strong synergy between amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was always observed.

TI  == the periodontal abscess (i). clinical and microbiological findings.
AB  == background/aims: little information is available regarding the diagnosis and microbiology of periodontal abscesses. the aim of this descriptive clinical and microbiological study was to provide more information in order to help in the characterisation of the periodontal abscess associated to periodontitis. method:  29 consecutive patients with a periodontal abscess were studied by the assessment of clinical variables, including both subjective (pain, edema, redness and swelling) and objective (bleeding on probing, suppuration, probing pocket depth,  tooth mobility and cervical lymphadenopathy) parameters. microbiological samples  were taken for anaerobic microbiology and processed by means of culture. systemic involvement was also studied through the analysis of blood and urine samples using conventional laboratory standards. results: 62% of the abscesses affected untreated periodontitis patients, and 69% were associated with a molar tooth. more than 75% of the abscesses had moderate-severe scores related to edema, redness and swelling, and 90% of the patients reported pain. bleeding occurred in all abscesses, while suppuration on sampling was detected in 66%. mean associated pocket depth was 7.28 mm, and 79% of teeth presented some degree of mobility. cervical lymphadenopathy was seen in 10% of patients, while elevated leucocyte counts were observed in 31.6%. the absolute number of neutrophils was elevated in 42% of the patients. high prevalences of putative periodontal pathogens were found, including fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and bacteroides forsythus. conclusions: the periodontal abscess has clear clinical characteristics and is usually associated with severe periodontal destruction. this condition may cause  systemic involvement and the lesion generally has a large bacterial mass with a high prevalence of well-recognised periodontal pathogens.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in english hiv-seropositive persons.
AB  == selected periodontopathic bacteria were sought in 20 hiv-infected english patients and eight noninfected control subjects with similar periodontal status,  using highly specific dna probes. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. a), porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently detected and were found at higher levels in hiv-infected individuals than in controls. significantly increased levels of treponema denticola but, in contrast, lower levels of eikenella corrodens were found in nonbleeding sites of hiv-infected patients compared with  controls. the results of the present investigation on english patients suggest a  periodontopathogenic role for a. a, p. gingivalis and c. rectus, and possibly p.  intermedia and are in general accord with most previously reported data from the  united states. longitudinal studies are now required to determine more precisely  the association between periodontopathic microflora, immune competence and periodontal health and disease in hiv-infected persons.

TI  == review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  == published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. the studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against gram-positive anaerobes (clostridium perfringens, all peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against gram-negative anaerobes. bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides tectum and many bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/l, while the other species of the b. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. species variability was evident: porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas macaccae, prevotella heparinolytica and prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/l  of gemifloxacin while most other porphyromonas and prevotella spp. were not. these data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some prevotella and porphyromonas spp.  may predominate.

TI  == interactions between periodontal bacteria and human oral epithelial cells: fusobacterium nucleatum adheres to and invades epithelial cells.
AB  == bacteria are causative agents of periodontal diseases. interactions between oral  bacteria and gingival epithelial cells are essential aspects of periodontal infections. using an in vitro tissue culture model, a selected group of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria frequently associated with periodontal diseases, including bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter curvus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia, were examined for their ability to adhere to and invade primary cultures of human gingival epithelial cells (hgec). the effects of these bacteria on the production of interleukin-8 (il-8), a proinflammatory chemokine, were also measured. these studies provided an initial demonstration that f. nucleatum adhered to and invaded hgec and that this was accompanied by high levels of il-8 secretion from  the epithelial cells. the attachment and invasion characteristics of f. nucleatum were also tested using kb cells, an oral epithelial cell line. the invasion was verified by transmission electron microscopy and with metabolic inhibitors. invasion appeared to occur via a "zipping" mechanism and required the involvement of actins, microtubules, signal transduction, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism of the epithelial cell, as well as protein synthesis by f. nucleatum.  a spontaneous mutant, lam, of f. nucleatum, isolated as defective in autoagglutination, was unable to attach to or invade hgec or kb cells, further indicating the requirement of bacterial components in these processes. sugar inhibition assays indicated that lectin-like interactions were involved in the attachment of f. nucleatum to kb cells. investigation of these new virulence phenotypes should improve our understanding of the role of f. nucleatum in periodontal infections.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == inducible expression of human beta-defensin 2 by fusobacterium nucleatum in oral  epithelial cells: multiple signaling pathways and role of commensal bacteria in innate immunity and the epithelial barrier.
AB  == human gingival epithelial cells (hge) express two antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family, human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) and hbd-2, as well as cytokines and chemokines that contribute to innate immunity. in the present study, the expression and transcriptional regulation of hbd-2 was examined. hbd-2 mrna was induced by cell wall extract of fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal microorganism, but not by that of porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen. hbd-2 mrna was also induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and phorbol myristate acetate (pma), an epithelial cell activator. hbd-2 mrna was also expressed in 14 of 15 noninflamed  gingival tissue samples. hbd-2 peptide was detected by immunofluorescence in hge  stimulated with f. nucleatum cell wall, consistent with induction of the mrna by  this stimulant. kinetic analysis indicates involvement of multiple distinct signaling pathways in the regulation of hbd-2 mrna; tnf-alpha and f. nucleatum cell wall induced hbd-2 mrna rapidly (2 to 4 h), while pma stimulation was slower ( approximately 10 h). in contrast, each stimulant induced interleukin 8 (il-8) within 1 h. the role of tnf-alpha as an intermediary in f. nucleatum signaling was ruled out by addition of anti-tnf-alpha that did not inhibit hbd-2 induction. however, inhibitor studies show that f. nucleatum stimulation of hbd-2 mrna requires both new gene transcription and new protein synthesis. bacterial lipopolysaccharides isolated from escherichia coli and f. nucleatum were poor stimulants of hbd-2, although they up-regulated il-8 mrna. collectively, our findings show inducible expression of hbd-2 mrna via multiple pathways in hge in  a pattern that is distinct from that of il-8 expression. we suggest that different aspects of innate immune responses are differentially regulated and that commensal organisms have a role in stimulating mucosal epithelial cells in maintaining the barrier that contributes to homeostasis and host defense.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the long-term biological and clinical effects of a controlled delivery system releasing tetracyclines during the healing of interproximal periodontal defects treated by the technique of guided tissue regeneration (gtr) using e-ptfe membranes. methods: fifteen patients, each with two comparable interproximal periodontal defects, underwent surgical treatment with e-ptfe membranes in conjunction with tetracycline fibres  at the test site and e-ptfe membranes alone at the control site. microbiological  specimens were taken from each site treated at baseline (t0) and one year after surgery (t4). plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), pocket depth at probing (pd) and attachment level at probing (pal) were recorded at baseline (t0) and one year after surgery (t4). the presence of selected pathogenic microbial species, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and actinobaccillus actinomicetemcomitans (aa), was investigated and these species were identified by cultural methods. results: no statistically  significant difference in the level of periodontal pathogens was detected between the test and control sites at time t4. likewise, no significant clinical difference between the test site and the control site was detected at time t4. conclusions: the results suggest that tetracycline fibres used in conjunction with e-ptfe membranes do not provide and further clinical and microbiological improvement or effect the healing of periodontal defects one year after gtr treatment.

AB  == we examined the induction of the cytokines interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6, and il-8 by lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from several species of possible endodontopathic black-pigmented bacteria. studies were conducted in human whole blood cultures from six patients (two from each group) with differing numbers of  periapical periodontitis lesions (i.e. patients with radiographically clear periapical lesions in 10 or more teeth (high-lesion group, n = 4), in one or two  teeth (low-lesion group, n = 6), and six healthy volunteers with no periapical lesions (no lesion group)). lps from prevotella intermedia atcc 25611, porphyromonas gingivalis 381, and prophyromonas endodontalis atcc 27067 induced a higher il-8 response in the subjects of the high-lesion group, compared with the  subjects of the other two groups. to ascertain the degree of sensitization by test bacteria, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in serum and saliva from the subjects to different bacterial species. lps from p. gingivalis reacted  strongly with sera from the high-lesion group. thus, lps from black-pigmented bacteria may be involved in multilesional periapical periodontitis by inducing particular cytokines and/or humoral immune responses.

AB  == coaggregation is one of the potential colonization strategies of oral microorganisms, often involving fimbrial structures in the interactions. in this  study, the coaggregation characteristics of the rough and smooth genotypes of the periodontal pathogen peptostreptococcus micros were compared to investigate the role of the fibril-like structures of the rough genotype in coaggregation. of the 11 oral species tested, only fusobacterium nucleatum strains and non-encapsulated porphyromonas gingivalis strains coaggregated with p. micros. no differences in coaggregation between the smooth type (sm), the rough type (rg) and the smooth variant of the rg type (rg(sm)) of p. micros were observed. heat-stable, periodate-sensitive structures on p. micros appeared to interact with heat- and protease-sensitive structures on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. these data indicate that these unimodal coaggregations are not mediated by the proteinaceous fibril-like structures of the rg genotype, but by carbohydrates present on both genotypes of p. micros.

TI  == acquisition of plasmin activity by fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and potential contribution to tissue destruction during periodontitis.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum has been associated with a variety of oral and nonoral infections such as periodontitis, pericarditis, bone infections, and brain abscesses. several studies have shown the role of plasmin, a plasma serine protease, in increasing the invasive capacity of microorganisms. in this study, we investigated the binding of human plasminogen to f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and its subsequent activation into plasmin. plasminogen-binding activity of bacterial cells was demonstrated by a solid-phase dot blot assay using an anti-plasminogen antibody. the binding activity was heat resistant and involved cell-surface lysine residues since it was abolished in the presence of the lysine analog epsilon-aminocaproic acid. activation of plasminogen-coated bacteria occurred following incubation with either streptokinase, urokinase-type  plasminogen activator (u-pa), or a porphyromonas gingivalis culture supernatant.  in the case of the p. gingivalis culture supernatant, a cysteine protease was likely involved in the activation. the plasmin activity generated on the cell surface of f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum could be inhibited by aprotinin. activation of plasminogen by u-pa was greatly enhanced when plasminogen was bound to bacteria rather than in a free soluble form. u-pa-activated plasminogen-coated f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum was found to degrade fibronectin, as determined by  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 was also degraded by the plasmin activity generated on the bacterial cells. this study suggests a possible role for plasminogen, which is present in affected periodontal sites, in promoting tissue destruction and invasion by nonproteolytic bacteria such as f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum.

TI  == enhanced interleukin-8 production in thp-1 human monocytic cells by lipopolysaccharide from oral microorganisms and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
AB  == granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) has been used to assist in bone marrow recovery during cancer chemotherapy. interleukin-8 (il-8) plays an important role in macrophage mediated inflammatory processes including exacerbation of periodontal diseases, one of the most common complications in gm-csf receiving cancer patients. the effect of gm-csf supplementation on il-8 production was investigated in a human monocyte cell line thp-1, stimulated with  lipopolysaccharide extracted from two oral microorganisms, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. resting thp-1 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml) of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum and/or gm-csf (50 iu/ml) for varying time periods. the production of il-8 in thp-1 cells was measured by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a very low level of the cytokine il-8 was produced constitutive in thp-1 cells. starting from 8 h of treatment and afterwards gm-csf alone significantly increased il-8 production in thp-1 cells. lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml) extracts from either f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis amplified il-8 production 500-800 times in comparison to resting thp-1 cells. when lipopolysaccharide of f. nucleatum or p.  gingivalis was supplemented with 50 iu/ml of gm-csf, there was a statistically significant enhanced production of il-8 by thp-1 cells after 1 day to 7 days of treatment as compared with lipopolysaccharide treatment alone. gm-csf (50 iu/ml)  also significantly increased il-8 production from 2-7 days of treatment of thp-1  cells when supplemented with a positive control, phorbol-12-myristate-13 acetate  (pma), as compared to pma treatment alone. these investigations using the in vitro thp-1 human monocyte cell model indicate that there may be an increase in the response on a cellular level to oral endotoxin following gm-csf therapy as evidenced by enhanced production of the tissue-reactive inflammatory cytokine, il-8.

AB  == papillon-lefevre syndrome patients exhibit hyperkeratosis palmo-plantaris and severe periodontitis. the syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait, but the mechanism of periodontal destruction is not known. this report presents the clinical and microbiological features of an 11-year old girl with papillon-lefevre syndrome. clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. in samples from 3 deep periodontal lesions, the occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification, and the presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus by a nested-pcr detection method. 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. major cultivable bacteria included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros (10.6%). a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens were identified by pcr analysis. the patient's non-affected parents and older brother revealed several periodontal pathogens but not a. actinomycetemcomitans. the viral examination demonstrated cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus in the subgingival sample of the papillon-lefevre syndrome patient. the father and brother yielded subgingival cytomegalovirus but  not epstein-barr type 1 virus. we hypothesize that human herpesviruses in concert with a. actinomycetemcomitans play important roles in the development of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == microbiological response of localized sites with recurrent periodontitis in maintenance patients treated with tetracycline fibers.
AB  == background: whether adjunctive tetracycline fibers can provide an additive effect to scaling and root planing in treating non-responsive sites in maintenance subjects is still controversial. recolonization of the bacteria from untreated sites or from the extracrevicular region may explain the insignificant response to local therapy. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbiological response of sites treated with tetracycline fibers combined with  scaling and root planing. methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. thirty patients on maintenance therapy having at least 2 non-adjacent sites in separate quadrants with probing depths between 4 to 8 mm with bleeding on probing, or aspartate aminotransferase enzyme levels > 800 microiu in the gingival crevicular fluid, were treated with scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibers or with scaling and root planing only. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment. a. actino-mycetemcomitans, c. rectus, b. forsythus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia were detected by culture, immunofluorescence, or pcr technique. results: there was a reduction of total bacterial cell count, as well as of certain periodontal pathogens, following treatment. the prevalence of  a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis and the mean proportions of c. rectus, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and p. gingivalis decreased after therapy, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to bacterial proportions or the number of positive sites. besides, the pathogens could not be eliminated from the periodontal pocket, and recolonization of the pocket was noted at 3 months post-treatment. conclusions: bacteria located within the cheek, tongue mucosa, saliva, or untreated sites may contribute to reinfection of the pockets and explain the insignificant response to local tetracycline therapy.

TI  == the effects of hiv viral load on the phagocytic activity of monocytes activated with lipopolysaccharide from oral microorganisms.
AB  == a study was undertaken to determine whether viral load status in hiv+ patients has any potential effect on monocyte phagocytic function both before and after challenge of the monocytes with lipopolysaccharide (lps) isolated from oral microorganisms. lps of two putative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) and fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) was prepared. whole blood samples in edta were collected from 30 hiv+ patients presenting for dental care at the university of maryland. control samples were prepared from appropriate uninfected individuals. viral load was determined using quantitative rt-pcr (amplicor, roche diagnostics). phagocytic function was determined using fitc labeled saccharomyces species in resting isolated monocytes and in cells after 24 h stimulation with 1 microgram/ml of lps of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. immunohistochemical staining was performed for complement receptor cr-1 (cd-35) on phagocyte cells. in hiv+ patients with high viral load (> 10,000 copies/ml), 13.5% of isolated resting monocytes demonstrated phagocytic activity, while 23% of the resting control monocytes from non-infected individuals showed phagocytic function. when the monocytes were stimulated with 1 microgram/ml of lps of f. nucleatum, phagocytic activity was observed in 18.5% of monocytes in patients with high viral load, 33.5% with moderate viral load (400-10,00 copies/ml) and 51% with low viral load (<400 copies/ml), while 62% of  the control monocytes demonstrated phagocytic activity. stimulation of monocytes  with lps of p. gingivalis showed similar results. complement receptor cd-35 showed a 50% decrease in expression in hiv+ patients with high viral load. a progressive decrease in monocyte/macrophage phagocytic function and cd-35 expression with and without oral lps activation occurs after hiv infection and this trend appears to be accentuated in patients with high viral load. this relationship may contribute to increased susceptibility to oral opportunistic infections in advanced hiv+ patients.

TI  == antigen activation of thp-1 human monocytic cells after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide from oral microorganisms and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
AB  == a human thp-1 monocyte cell line culture system has been utilized to evaluate the morphological changes in thp-1 cells and to measure expression of activation antigens (cd-11b, cd-11c, cd-14, cd-35, cd-68, cd-71 and hla-dr) as evidence of maturation of thp-1 cells in response to stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (lps)  from the oral microorganisms, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. thp-1 cells were stimulated with lps (1 microgram/ml) of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum for different time periods (1, 2, 4 and 7 d). detection of different activation antigens on thp-1 cells was performed by indirect immunohistochemical staining followed by light microscopy. confirmational studies were performed in parallel using indirect immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy for detection of the corresponding activation antigens. expression of different activation antigens by resting thp-1 cells revealed hla-dr to be on 3% of the cells; cd-11b, 9%; cd-11c, 8%; cd-14, 22%; cd-35, 9% and cd-68, 7%. the cd-71 activation antigen was not expressed in untreated thp-1 cells. lps stimulation increased expression of all activation antigens. a significant (p < 0.05) increase in expression of cd-11b, cd-11c, cd-14, cd-35, cd-68 and cd-71 was observed when gm-csf (50 iu/ml) was supplemented during the treatment of thp-1 cells with lps of f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis. activation and differentiation of thp-1 cells by lps from oral microorganisms in the presence of gm-csf supports a role for human macrophages in acute and chronic periodontal diseases and may explain the clinically observable periodontal exacerbations in some patients after gm-csf therapy.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other micro-organisms in adult refractory periodontitis.
AB  == forty-six adult periodontal patients, selected on the basis of clinical examination, and 46 adult healthy subjects were examined. the subgingival plaque  samples from one inflammatory and one non-inflammatory site of each periodontal patient were studied to determine porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to  other periodontal micro-organisms and to periodontal tissue destruction. the results showed porphyromonas gingivalis as the main pathogenic micro-organism isolated in the inflammatory sites together with bacteroides forsythus. peptostreptococcus sp., actinomyces sp. and prevotella sp. were found as a normal oral flora in the healthy subjects. fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens were detected both in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory sites of periodontal patients as well as in  the healthy subjects.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of initial periodontal therapy in conjunction with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in patients with adult periodontitis. a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological  effects of initial periodontal therapy in conjunction with systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid in adult periodontitis patients using a double-blind, parallel-group, and placebo-controlled protocol. 21 patients with a clinical diagnosis of generalised adult periodontitis were recruited. clinical measurements and microbiological assessments were carried out at baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. approximately 6 weeks after initial periodontal treatment (3-6 h), patients were randomly assigned to receive coded study medication of 500 mg amoxicillin plus 125 mg clavulanic acid (augmentin) or placebo, every 8 h for 10 days. patients returned for follow-up visits 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after completion of the medication. the mean plaque index (pi) at baseline was 1.1 for placebo group and 0.9 for the test group. at 3 months, the pi had dropped to 0.3 in both groups, and was maintained during the rest of the study. the changes in bleeding on probing (bop) and gingival index (gi) in the course of the study were similar in both groups. the mean whole mouth probing pocket depth (ppd) in the placebo group was 3.8 mm at baseline and 3.9 mm in the  test group. a mean reduction of 1.0 mm in the placebo group and 0.9 mm in the test group was observed during the first 3 months. no further reduction in ppd was noticed during the study period in either group. there was no statistically significant difference in the ppd reduction between the 2 groups. the change in clinical attachment level (cal) from baseline to 3 months amounted to 0.5 mm in both groups. between 3 and 12 months, the cal changed in neither group. in both groups, treatment resulted in a decrease in the number of spirochetes and motile  rods in positive patients, but no significant differences between either group were noted in any of the dark field microscopy observations. at baseline, 1 patient in the placebo group and 2 patients in the test group were culture positive for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). after therapy, aa was not detectable in the placebo group and 1 patient remained positive in the test group. in the placebo group, the number of patients positive for porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) decreased from 7 to 2 after therapy. in the test group, the 4 patients positive for pg at baseline remained positive after therapy. in both groups, all subjects were positive for prevotella intermedia (pi) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) at baseline. at 12 months, all subjects had detectable subgingival fn. 9 out of the 11 placebo and 8 of the 10 test patients  remained positive for pi. there were no differences in detection frequency of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and bacteroides forsythus (bf) in both groups between baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. the findings demonstrated that, in comparison to placebo, systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid provided no additional clinical and microbiological effects in the treatment of adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == a 15-month evaluation of the effects of repeated subgingival minocycline in chronic adult periodontitis.
AB  == background: a double-blind, randomized, parallel, comparative study was designed  to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of subgingivally administered minocycline ointment versus a vehicle control. methods: one hundred four patients (104) with moderate to severe adult periodontitis (34 to 64 years of age; mean 46 years) were enrolled in the study. following scaling and root planing, patients were randomized to receive either 2% minocycline ointment or a matched vehicle control. study medication was administered directly into the periodontal pocket with a specially designed, graduated, disposable applicator at baseline; week 2;  and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. scaling and root planing was repeated at months 6 and 12. standard clinical variables (including probing depth and attachment level) were evaluated at baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. microbiological sampling using dna probes was done at baseline; at week 2; and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. results: both treatment groups showed significant  and clinically relevant reductions in the numbers of each of the 7 microorganisms measured during the entire 15-month study period. when differences were detected, sites treated with minocycline ointment always produced statistically significantly greater reductions than sites which received the vehicle control. for initial pockets > or =5 mm, a mean reduction in probing depth of 1.9 mm was seen in the test sites, versus 1.2 mm in the control sites. sites with a baseline probing depth > or =7 mm and bleeding index >2 showed an average of 2.5 mm reduction with minocycline versus 1.5 mm with the vehicle. gains in attachment (0.9 mm and 1.1 mm) were observed in minocycline-treated sites, with baseline probing depth > or =5 mm and > or =7 mm, respectively, compared with 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm gain at control sites. subgingival administration of minocycline ointment  was well tolerated. conclusions: overall, the results demonstrate that repeated subgingival administration of minocycline ointment in the treatment of adult periodontitis is safe and leads to significant adjunctive improvement after subgingival instrumentation in both clinical and microbiologic variables over a 15-month period.

TI  == flow cytometry to monitor phagocytosis and oxidative burst of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == the reduced susceptibility to phagocytosis found among some periodontopathogenic  anaerobes may account for the differences between invasive and non-invasive strains. we applied flow cytometry as a powerful tool to analyze and quantify phagocytosis using standardized cultures of oral anaerobes (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros) and heparinized whole blood. bacteria were labeled by a fluorescein-methylester and their esterase activity, resulting in green fluorescence. ingested bacteria could be detected easily and quantified by a shift towards green fluorescence in  the pmnl population involved and a concomitant decrease in the bacterial population. furthermore, the oxidative burst of pmnls was detected in parallel assays using the dye dhr123 which becomes fluorescent upon oxidation during the oxidative burst process. we found a great diversity in phagocytosis susceptibility determined by estimating the portion of phagocytosing pmnls, ranging from 10.6% (strain w83) to > 99.4% (e.g. atcc 33277t) in p. gingivalis and from 15.9% (strain mh5) to > 95% (atcc 33563t) in p. nigrescens. in contrast, almost all p. intermedia strains as well as the representatives of the other anaerobic, putative periodontopathic species tested showed no or only moderate resistance in the phagocytosis assay. comparison of clinical data of patients and the extent of phagocytosis resistance of the corresponding p. gingivalis strains  suggests that this virulence factor may contribute to the clinical outcome.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of putative periodontal pathogens in advanced periodontitis patients.
AB  == in the present study, the antibiotic susceptibility of most prevalent micro-organisms in advanced periodontitis patients was evaluated. in 56 patients, pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest site of each quadrant and were cultivated anaerobically. from each patient, the 4 most frequently encountered types of bacterial colonies were subcultured and identified (rapid id 32 a). from all bacterial species identified in the 224 subcultures, the 4 most prevalent were used for susceptibility testing to tetracycline, metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanate using the e test. the most prevalent microorganisms were fusobacterium nucleatum (38/214), peptostreptococcus micros (33/214), prevotella oralis (33/214) and porphyromonas  gingivalis (32/214). regarding antibiotic susceptibility it could be shown that minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) in all cases was below antibiotic concentrations achievable in gingival crevicular fluid. however, antibiotic resistance was seen in 3 to 29% of the investigated microorganisms.

TI  == effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == in this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). the growth of p. gingivalis was only moderately affected when h2o2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mm in a complex culture medium. however, when a defined basal medium was used, h2o2 at  a concentration of 3 mm completely inhibited growth of p. gingivalis. incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mm in both media had no effect on growth. the effects of h2o2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. both activities were strongly decreased when h2o2  was added in the assay mixtures. this inhibitory effect of h2o2 was reversible. on the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. h2o2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-68 and hsp-75 by p. gingivalis, as determined by sds-page and western immunoblotting analysis. in the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (eh) of the environment. it was found that certain  species were able to either decrease (p. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus mutans) or increase (streptococcus sanguis) the eh of the medium. our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as h2o2 may affect the biology of p. gingivalis. moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in adult twins.
AB  == background: both environmental and genetic factors are known to influence clinical measures of periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic factors similarly influence the presence of specific periodontal bacteria in subgingival plaque. methods: reared-together and reared-apart monozygous (mz) and dizygous (dz) adult twins were examined clinically. demographic and behavioral information was obtained from each subject by questionnaire. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from the index teeth,  and the presence of p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum was determined using an immunoassay. results: microbiological and clinical data were available for 169 twin pairs. the subject-based prevalences of the bacteria in the twin groups ranged from 11% for  porphyromonas gingivalis to 40% for f. nucleatum. for all species examined, the concordance rates were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between mz and dz twin groups. these findings were apparent despite similar smoking histories, self-reported oral hygiene practices, and antibiotic use in the twin groups. furthermore, mz twins reared together were not more similar than mz reared-apart  twins with respect to any bacterial species examined. conclusions: these findings suggest that in a population with access to routine dental care, any effects that host genes and the early family environment have on the presence of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque are not apparent in adulthood. most twins with disease in this study had early periodontitis. results from this study may not necessarily be extrapolated to more advanced disease states.

TI  == induction of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == we examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte autoantibody (ata) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral escherichia coli. all of the lps induced igm-ata. among these, lps from  c. ochracea induced the highest level of igm-ata, whereas that of p. gingivalis induced the lowest. the peritoneal t lymphocytes of mice injected with lps were bound by igm-ata. peritoneal b-1 (cd5+b) cells stimulated by each lps produced much more igm-ata than splenic b-2 (cd5-b) cells, suggesting that b-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. serum of mice injected with c. ochracea and f. nucleatum lps showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by igm purified from serum of the mice injected with c. ochracea lps. furthermore, serum of mice treated with c. ochracea, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans  lps inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. however, purified igm from the serum of mice treated with c. ochracea lps failed to produce the same inhibition. our results suggest that lps from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce igm-ata in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.

TI  == coaggregation of candida dubliniensis with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the binding of microorganisms to each other and oral surfaces contributes to the  progression of microbial infections in the oral cavity. candida dubliniensis, a newly characterized species, has been identified in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients and other immunocompromised individuals. c. dubliniensis phenotypically resembles candida albicans in many respects yet can be identified and differentiated as a unique candida species by phenotypic and genetic profiles. the purpose of this study was to determine oral coaggregation (coag) partners of c. dubliniensis and to compare these findings with coag of c.  albicans under the same environmental conditions. fifteen isolates of c. dubliniensis and 40 isolates of c. albicans were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. when c. dubliniensis and c. albicans strains were grown at 37 degrees c on sabouraud dextrose agar, only c. dubliniensis strains coaggregated with f. nucleatum atcc 49256 and no c. albicans strains showed coag. however, when the c. dubliniensis and c. albicans strains were grown at 25 or 45 degrees c, both c. dubliniensis and c. albicans strains demonstrated coag with f. nucleatum. heating the c. albicans strains (grown at 37 degrees c) at 85 degrees c for 30 min or treating them with dithiothreitol allowed the c. albicans strains grown at 37 degrees c to coaggregate with f. nucleatum. coag at all growth temperatures was inhibited by mannose and alpha-methyl mannoside but not by edta or arginine. the coag reaction between f.  nucleatum and the candida species involved a heat-labile component on f. nucleatum and a mannan-containing heat-stable receptor on the candida species. the coag reactions between f. nucleatum and the candida species may be important  in the colonization of the yeast in the oral cavity, and the coag of c. dubliniensis by f. nucleatum when grown at 37 degrees c provides a rapid, specific, and inexpensive means to differentiate c. dubliniensis from c. albicans isolates in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

TI  == interleukin-6 production by human monocytes treated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the presence of lipopolysaccharide of oral microorganisms.
AB  == this study focused on the effect of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) and lipopolysaccharide of the putative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum on il-6 production by thp-1 cells (a human monocytic cell line). resting thp-1 cells were alternatively treated with gm-csf (50 iu/ml) and lipopolysaccharide of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum, in varying concentrations for varying time periods. il-6 production in supernatant fluids of treated cells was evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to evaluate gene expression. untreated thp-1 cells did not produce il-6 as determined by elisa. rt-pcr also failed to detect il-6 mrna in untreated thp-1 cells, indicating that il-6 was not constitutively produced. after stimulation of thp-1 cells with lipopolysaccharide of f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis, il-6 was produced, peaking at 4 h (200-300 pg/ml) and thereafter sharply declining by 8 h. when gm-csf was added together with lipopolysaccharide  of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum, there was a synergistic quantitative increase in production of il-6 as measured by elisa as compared with lipopolysaccharide alone. il-6 mrna was detected by rt-pcr, 15 min after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide of either p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. gm-csf supplementation with lipopolysaccharide of p. gingivalis shortened the transcription of il-6 mrna to 5 min, a shift which was not observed with lipopolysaccharide of f. nucleatum, possibly indicating a different mechanism of  initiation of transcription. production of il-6 by gm-csf-treated thp-1 cells in  the presence of lipopolysaccharide of oral microorganisms may provide a model for studying the role of macrophages in acute and chronic periodontal diseases, including the clinical periodontal exacerbation as observed in chemotherapy patients receiving gm-csf for bone marrow recovery.

TI  == relationship of the subgingival microbiota to a chairside test for aspartate aminotransferase in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). methods: thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. within each subject, the ast contents of gcf from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. ast-positive site refers to one that had an ast level > or = 800 microiu. subgingival plaque samples from one ast-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. one site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. culture and immunofluorescence (if) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, and porphyromonas gingivalis. logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the ast test and certain specific pathogens. results: the gcf scores and  total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in ast-positive sites than either ast-negative or healthy sites. the prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as c rectus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, p. intermedia, and p. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. in analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the ast test by logistic regression, only p. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. the odds ratio of having a  high proportion of p. gingivalis in the presence of a positive ast test was 1.21. conclusions: the present study showed that at ast-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. although only the correlation of p. gingivalis and ast values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of ast levels in gcf.

TI  == inflammatory cytokine production and specific antibody responses against possible causative bacteria in patients with multilesional periapical periodontitis.
AB  == we examined the induction of inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) by several species of possible causative bacteria in periapical periodontitis. assays were done on human whole blood cultures from patients with differing numbers of periapical lesions; those having radiographically clear periapical lesions in 10 or more teeth (high lesion group), in one or two teeth (low lesion group), and healthy volunteers having no periapical lesions (no lesion group). prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845 induced interleukin-6 more strongly in subjects from the high lesion group than in the other groups. to ascertain the degree of sensitization by test bacteria, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in serum and saliva from the six subjects to different bacterial species. porphylomonas gingivalis cells reacted strongly with sera from the high lesion group. thus, prevotella melaninogenica and porphylomonas gingivalis may be involved in multilesional periapical periodontitis by inducing specific cytokines and/or humoral immune responses.

AB  == intergeneric coaggregation is responsible for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to be important in the initial bacterial colonization of the human oral cavity. actinomyces naeslundii, an early colonizer of the tooth surface, may enhance subsequent colonization by porphyromonas gingivalis which is associated with adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize the a. naeslundii aggregation factor (anaf) that mediates coaggregation with p. gingivalis. anaf was isolated from a. naeslundii sonic extract (se) by gel filtration on a sephacryl s-400hr, by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a hitrap octyl sepharose 4ff, and by ion exchange chromatography on a hitrap q. the specific activity increased 12-fold with a yield of 2.5%. sds-page analysis of anaf revealed a protein band of high molecular weight in excess of 200 kda. carbohydrate was detected as the only material coinciding with the protein band, indicating that the anaf was a glycoprotein. immunoblotting analysis indicated that anaf directly bound to p. gingivalis cells. anaf was sensitive to sodium metaperiodate treatment but not to heat or protease treatments. these results suggest that the anaf carbohydrate component mediated coaggregation with p. gingivalis cells. anaf also inhibited coaggregation with other periodontal disease-associated bacteria such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, but not  streptococci.

TI  == analysis of serum antibody responses to periodontopathogens in early-onset periodontitis patients from different geographical locations.
AB  == serum antibody specificity to oral micro-organisms was used to delineate the pathogens associated with early-onset periodontal diseases in a turkish population. additionally, comparison of the findings to those derived from a clinically similar us patient population described differences in bacterial specific antibody between these 2 geographic regions. serum from 89 (ljp), 86 (rpp) and 94 (normal) subjects was analyzed (elisa) to determine igg antibody to  14 oral micro-organisms. all ljp patients from turkey exhibited elevated antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes c and a significantly increased), while antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and jp2 (serotype b) were significantly higher in us ljp patients. 50% of the turkish rpp patients also showed elevated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans antibody, although the us rpp patients exhibited significantly higher antibody levels and frequency of elevated antibody to the a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. healthy subjects and ljp and  rpp patients from the us exhibited higher antibody levels to all 3 p. gingivalis  serogroups compared to those from turkey, although, the frequency of elevated antibody to the p. gingivalis serogroups was significantly higher in ljp and rpp  patients from turkey than from the us. interestingly, 87% and 77% of the ljp patients in the turkish population had elevated antibody responses to p. gingivalis and e. corrodens, respectively, which was not observed in the us ljp patients. these data suggested that considerable variation exists in the systemic antibody levels to periodontopathogens between these 2 countries. this supports potential differences in subgingival colonization or antigenic composition of these pathogens between patient populations from different geographical regions.

TI  == additional clinical and microbiological effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole  after initial periodontal therapy.
AB  == the aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects  of initial periodontal therapy (it) and to determine the additional effects of systemic amoxicillin (flemoxin solutab) 375 mg tid plus metronidazole 250 mg tid  therapy, in patients with adult actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa)-associated periodontitis in conjunction with either porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), bacteroides forsythus (bf) and/or prevotella intermedia (pi). in addition the adverse effects of the antimicrobial therapy were also documented. a total of 22 patients were enrolled. the deepest, bleeding pocket in each quadrant was selected and at these 4 experimental sites clinical measurements and microbiological testing was carried out at baseline, after (it), i.e., 21 weeks after baseline, and after antimicrobial therapy (am), i.e., 35 weeks after baseline. at baseline, the mean plaque index (pi) amounted 0.5, 0.1 after it and  0.3 after systemic am. the mean bleeding index decreased from 1.6 to 1.2 after it and a further decrease to 0.7 after am was noted. suppuration was completely eliminated after am. the mean change of probing pocket depth (ppd) after it amounted 1.4 mm and was further reduced with an additional mean change of 1.1 mm  after medication. clinical attachment gain was 1.1 mm after it and an additional  0.9 mm was observed after am. one of the 22 aa positive patients and 4 of 17 pg positive patients became negative for these species after it. the number of patients with detectable pi decreased from 16 to 10 after it. after am, in comparison to baseline, suppression below detection level for aa was achieved in  19 out of 22, for pg in 9 out of 17, for bf in 13 out of 14, and for pi in 11 out of 16 patients. by contrast, higher frequencies of peptostreptococcus micros and  fusobacterium nucleatum were found after am. on the basis of the microbiological  results the study group was separated into 2 subgroups: group a consisted of subjects who had no detectable levels of aa, pg, bf and <5% of pi after am. group b consisted of those who still showed presence of one of these 3 species and/or > or =5% levels of pi. after am, group b had significantly higher pi, bi, ppd and cal scores then group a. it is concluded that group a showed low plaque scores and no detectable periodontal pathogens. this microbiological condition has been  associated with a long-term stable periodontium.

TI  == [a comparative in-vitro study of the bactericidal efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine gluconate plus cetrimide on root canal anaerobic bacterial flora].
AB  == introduction: the permanence of necrotic tissues and/or bacteria may be responsible for persistent root canal infection. root canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the progressive elimination of the smear layer and, on the other, it neutralises microbic flora within the canal. the aim of this study was  to test root canal irrigants from a microbiological point of view: sodium hypochlorite 5% (niclor ogna, milan) and a new generation irrigant based on chlorhexidine gluconate and cetrimide (cetrexidine vebas s. giuliano milanese-mi). methods: the experiments were performed on a series of obligatory anaerobic bacteria which are most frequently found in the endodontium, all belonging to the international collection "american type culture collection" (atcc) and supplied by dasit spa, cornaredo (mi). the following bacterial strains were used in the experiment: actinimyces odontolyticus atcc 17929, fusobacterium  nucleatum atcc 25586, prevotella melanginogenica atcc 25845, porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277. the working concentration (cfu/ml) was defined as 0.5 mcfarland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms equivalent to approx. 1.5 x 10(3) bacteria. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for this experiment for 10', 20', 30'. results: the results obtained confirm the bactericidal efficacy of both irrigants used, even after a short contact time. conclusions: this does not mean that all irrigants are the same and/or promise the same results. this was a microbiological study, but in practice it is important to bear in mind other variables, such as contact  time. moreover, in order to increase the probability of endodontic treatment, root canal irrigants are also required to satisfy other criteria: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.

TI  == functional changes in thp-1 human monocytic cells after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide of oral microorganisms and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor.
AB  == a human thp-1 monocyte cell line culture system has been utilized to observe the  effect of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf) supplementation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) of oral microorganisms to stimulate monocyte/macrophage functional activity. lps of oral microorganisms, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis was produced by phenol-water extraction and characterized. the phagocytosis assay was performed using f1tc labeled saccharomyces yeast particles. phagocytic functional activity was observed in 10-11% of resting thp-1 cells. treatment of thp-1 cells with lps of f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis increased the phagocytic activity of thp-1 cells 2-3 fold. gm-csf significantly increased phagocytosis either alone or when supplemented with lps of f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis. a chemotaxis assay was performed using a 48 well chemotaxis chamber. chemotactic functional activity of  thp-1 cells was increased 2-fold after 4 days of treatment with gm-csf. stimulation of thp-1 cells with lps of f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis significantly reduced the chemotactic activity indicating the maturation towards  a fixed macrophage. there were functional variations (chemotaxis and phagocytosis) in thp-1 cells in response to lps of oral microorganisms following  stimulation with gm-csf.

TI  == cytotoxic effect of endodontic bacteria on periapical fibroblasts.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (sbes) from anaerobic gram-negative bacteria on periapical fibroblast obtained from the apical portion of human periodontal ligaments. porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium  nucleatum were chosen from among the endodontic bacteria isolated from root canals having a periapical lesion and compared in terms of their cytotoxicity. the purpose of this study was to examine which bacteria are involved in the development of periapical inflammation. the anaerobes were cultured under strict  anaerobic conditions, and the bacterial cells were then harvested by centrifugation after incubation. the concentrated cell suspensions were sonicated and subsequently centrifuged. an sbe was made of each of the filtered supernatants. each sbe was added to cultures of periapical fibroblasts. the cell  growth and proliferation were measured by the mtt method after 3, 5, and 7 days.  the sbes from p. endodontalis, p. gingivalis, and f. nucleatum inhibited the growth of the fibroblasts, whereas the sbe from p. intermedia did not inhibit it. the sbes from p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum inhibited the fibroblast growth more strongly than did the p. endodontalis, p. gingivalis, and f. nucleatum may participate in the development of periapical lesions.

TI  == role of fusobacterium nucleatum and coaggregation in anaerobe survival in planktonic and biofilm oral microbial communities during aeration.
AB  == coaggregation is a well-characterized phenomenon by which specific pairs of oral  bacteria interact physically. the aim of this study was to examine the patterns of coaggregation between obligately anaerobic and oxygen-tolerant species that coexist in a model oral microbial community. obligate anaerobes other than fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregated only poorly with oxygen-tolerant species. in contrast, f. nucleatum was able to coaggregate not only with both oxygen-tolerant and other obligately anaerobic species but also with otherwise-noncoaggregating obligate anaerobe-oxygen-tolerant species pairs. the effects of the presence or absence of f. nucleatum on anaerobe survival in both the biofilm and planktonic phases of a complex community of oral bacteria grown in an aerated (gas phase, 200 ml of 5% co2 in air x min-1) chemostat system were then investigated. in the  presence of f. nucleatum, anaerobes persisted in high numbers (>10(7) x ml-1 in the planktonic phase and >10(7) x cm-2 in 4-day biofilms). in an equivalent culture in the absence of f. nucleatum, the numbers of black-pigmented anaerobes  (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens) were significantly reduced (p </= 0.001) in both the planktonic phase and in 4-day biofilms, while the numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria increased in these communities. coaggregation-mediated interactions between f. nucleatum and other species facilitated the survival of obligate anaerobes in aerated environments.

TI  == early-onset periodontitis associated with down's syndrome--clinical interventional study.
AB  == individuals with down's syndrome (ds) have an increased prevalence of periodontal disease compared with otherwise normal, age-matched control groups and other mentally handicapped patients of similar age distribution. the exaggerated immune-inflammatory response of the tissues cannot be explained by poor oral hygiene alone and might be the result of an impaired cell-mediated and humoral immunity and a deficient phagocytic system. as far as the progression and severity of destruction, the oral manifestations of ds patients are consistent with the juvenile periodontitis (jp) disease pattern. the purpose of the present  study was 1) to assess the periodontal clinical and microbiological status of 10  ds patients aged 20 to 31 years (mean: 26.3 years) relative to that of 11 patients with cerebral palsy (cp) aged 23 to 53 years (mean: 36 years) without defective immunological functions, and 2) to determine the effect of supragingival plaque control and oral hygiene instruction in these patient groups. subsequent to the initial examination and a professional tooth cleaning program, clinical and microbiological parameters were monitored over a period of  12 weeks. the clinical examination included the recording of plaque index (p1), gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal). subgingival plaque samples were always obtained from the same pocket with the highest disease activity (deepest bleeding site at baseline examination) in each  subject for a morphotype analysis by dark field microscopy and for identification and quantitation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus by dna probes. the results of the baseline examinations demonstrated that ds patients and patients with cerebral palsy had inflamed gingiva associated with a high amount of plaque. the mean probing depth and percentage of sites with probing depth> 4 mm corresponded to age and poor oral hygiene in cp patients. deep pockets in ds patients demonstrated a high prevalence of periodontal disease compared with age-matched children with mental retardation and non-handicapped patients. regarding the young age of onset, the severe destruction of periodontal tissues and pathogenesis of periodontitis in ds patients are consistent with the  juvenile periodontitis disease pattern. the missing clinical benefit and alteration of the subgingival flora following supragingival plaque control in ds  patients underlined the alteration in the immunological response.

TI  == oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == expression of the peptide antibiotic human beta-defensin 1 in cultured gingival epithelial cells and gingival tissue.
AB  == human beta-defensin-1 (hbd-1) is a member of the family of small cationic antimicrobial peptides that have been identified in several mucosal epithelia. because human gingival epithelium is a site that is constantly challenged by oral microorganisms, we examined the expression of hbd-1 in human gingival epithelial  and fibroblast cell cultures and tissue samples. cell cultures were challenged with cell wall extracts of porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or phorbol myristate acetate. hbd-1 mrna was detected in unstimulated and stimulated cultures by reverse transcription (rt)-pcr using several primer sets specific for hbd-1. gingival epithelial cells, but not gingival fibroblasts, expressed a product of the predicted size for hbd-1 mrna. the sequence of the pcr product was identical to that of hbd-1. hbd-1 mrna expression was not significantly modulated by any of the stimulants tested. human gingival tissues from noninflamed and inflamed sites were also analyzed by rt-pcr. hbd-1 mrna was expressed in all tissue samples. the relative expression of hbd-1 mrna was similar in noninflamed  and inflamed tissues obtained from each of four patients undergoing treatment for periodontitis. however, the relative expression of hbd-1 mrna varied in gingival  biopsies obtained from 15 different normal individuals, and the relative hbd-1 expression was unrelated to interleukin-8 expression. our findings show the constitutive expression of hbd-1 mrna in cultured epithelial cells and gingival tissues but not gingival fibroblasts. these findings suggest that expression of hbd-1 may play a role as part of the innate host defenses in maintaining normal gingival health.

TI  == bone resorption caused by three periodontal pathogens in vivo in mice is mediated in part by prostaglandin.
AB  == gingival inflammation, bacterial infection, alveolar bone destruction, and subsequent tooth loss are characteristic features of periodontal disease, but the precise mechanisms of bone loss are poorly understood. most animal models of the  disease require injury to gingival tissues or teeth, and the effects of microorganisms are thus complicated by host responses to tissue destruction. to determine whether three putative periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, could cause localized bone resorption in vivo in the absence of tissue injury, we injected live or heat-killed preparations of these microorganisms into the subcutaneous tissues overlying the calvaria of normal mice once daily for 6 days and then examined the bones histologically. we found that all three microorganisms (both live and heat  killed) stimulated bone resorption and that the strain of f. nucleatum used appeared to be the strongest inducer of osteoclast activity. treatment of the mice concomitantly with indomethacin reduced but did not completely inhibit bone  resorption by these microorganisms, suggesting that their effects were mediated,  in part, by arachidonic acid metabolites (e.g., prostaglandins). our findings indicate that these potential pathogens can stimulate bone resorption locally when placed beside a bone surface in vivo in the absence of prior tissue injury and support a role for them in the pathogenesis of bone loss around teeth in periodontitis.

TI  == dentilisin activity affects the organization of the outer sheath of treponema denticola.
AB  == prolyl-phenylalanine-specific serine protease (dentilisin) is a major extracellular protease produced by treponema denticola. the gene, prtp, coding for the protease was recently cloned and sequenced (k. ishihara, t. miura, h. k.  kuramitsu, and k. okuda, infect. immun. 64:5178-5186, 1996). in order to determine the role of this protease in the physiology and virulence of t. denticola, a dentilisin-deficient mutant, k1, was constructed following electroporation with a prtp-inactivated dna fragment. no chymotrypsin-like protease activity was detected in the dentilisin-deficient mutant. in addition, the high-molecular-mass oligomeric protein characteristic of the outer sheath of  the organism decreased in the mutant. furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the mutant was decreased, and coaggregation of the mutant with fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced compared to that of the wild-type organism. the results obtained with a mouse abscess model system indicated that the virulence of the mutant was attenuated relative to that of the wild-type organism. these results suggest that dentilisin activity plays a major role in the structural organization of the outer sheath of t. denticola. the loss of dentilsin activity  and the structural change in the outer sheath affect the pathogenicity of t. denticola.

TI  == severity of localized juvenile periodontitis as related to polymorphonuclear chemotaxis and specific microbial isolates.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to determine if an association exists  between severity of localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) and impairment of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) chemotaxis and/or colonization by specific microbial isolates; (b) to determine if the number of specific microbial isolates, i.e., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus correlates to clinical severity of sites with ljp. thirty-six first molars in nine subjects with ljp were examined. a clinical severity score was computed based on attachment level and vertical bone loss. the mean score of the four sites was designated as the clinical severity score for each subject. a dna probe was used to quantitate colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, e. corrodens,  and c. rectus. the chemotaxis of isolated peripheral blood pmns was measured in boyden chambers using the leading front technique. it was found that the clinical severity score ranged from 7.8 for mild involvement to 32.5 for severe ljp. the chemotaxis result for each patient (micron/90 min) was expressed as a percentage  of the value for a paired healthy control and ranged from 40% to 104%. four of the nine subjects had chemotaxis values less than 70% of control. linear regression analysis showed: (a) no significant correlation between pmn chemotaxis and severity of ljp in subjects (r = .14); (b) a significant correlation (r = 0.43) between severe sites with ljp and number of specific microbial isolates. sites with severe ljp had present at least five different microbial isolates as compared with non-severe sites (p < .05). no particular trend of colonization by  periodontopathogens was seen in non-severe sites. further, severe sites of ljp displayed a statistically significant greater colonization by p. intermedia, e. corrodens, and c. rectus than did non-severe sites (p < .05). it may be concluded that neither the degree of pmn chemotactic impairment nor a. actinomycetemcomitans is a reliable indicator of the severity of ljp.

TI  == studies on fusobacteria associated with periodontal diseases.
AB  == the physiological and metabolic characteristics of representative isolates of the various subspecies of fusobacterium nucleatum were investigated by growing them in continuous culture in chemically-defined, media. behaving almost identically,  these organisms were found to obtain energy from the fermentation of simple carbohydrates such as glucose or fructose or from the fermentation of certain amino acids, free or in the form of small peptides. the latter can be attacked by aminopeptidase activity which was shown to be essential for the growth of the organism in an environment lacking fermentable carbohydrate and free amino acids  but replete with small peptides. this metabolic versatility may explain the presence of f. nucleatum in both supra- and sub-gingival dental plaque and why it is often found together with organisms such as porphyromonas gingivalis which display powerful endopeptidase activities. using the technique of allozyme electrophoresis, the current subspeciation of f. nucleatum was shown to be of doubtful validity and evidence, based upon physiological and metabolic properties, for differences in pathogenicity between isolates was not detected. while this organism is a member of various bacterial consortia associated with periodontal diseases, its contribution to the disease process remains unclear.

TI  == granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor amplification of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha production in thp-1 human monocytic cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide of oral microorganisms.
AB  == cytokines, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf), are used to assist in bone marrow recovery during cancer chemotherapy. interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) play important roles in inflammatory processes, including exacerbation of periodontal  diseases, one of the most common complications in patients who undergo this therapy. a human monocyte cell line (thp-1) was utilized to investigate il-1beta  and tnf-alpha production following gm-csf supplementation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from two oral microorganisms, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. lps of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum was prepared by a phenol-water extraction method and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis and determination of total protein and endotoxin contents. resting thp-1 cells were treated with lps of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum and/or gm-csf (50 iu/ml) by using different concentrations for various time periods. production of il-1beta and tnf-alpha in thp-1 cells was measured by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. reverse transcription (rt)-pcr was used to evaluate the gene expression of resting and treated thp-1 cells. il-1beta was not detected in untreated thp-1 cells. il-1beta production was, however, stimulated sharply at 4 h. gm-csf amplified il-1beta production in thp-1 cells treated with  lps from both oral anaerobes. no il-1beta-specific mrna transcript was detected in untreated thp-1 cells. however, il-1beta mrna was detected by rt-pcr 2 h after stimulation of thp-1 cells with lps from both organisms. gm-csf did not shorten the il-1beta transcriptional activation time. gm-csf plus f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis lps activated thp-1 cells to produce a 1.6-fold increase in tnf-alpha  production at 4 h over lps stimulation alone. these investigations with the in vitro thp-1 model indicate that there may be an increase in the cellular immune response to oral endotoxin following gm-csf therapy, as evidenced by production of the tissue-reactive cytokines il-1beta and tnf-alpha.

AB  == the ability of butyric acid, an extracellular metabolite from periodontopathic bacteria, to induce apoptosis in murine wehi 231 cells, splenic b cells, and human raji cells was examined. the culture filtrate of porphyromonas gingivalis,  prevotella loescheii, and fusobacterium nucleatum, which contains high a percentage of butyric acid, induced dna fragmentation in wehi 231 cells. volatile fatty acid, especially butyric acid, significantly suppressed b-cell viability in a concentration-dependent fashion. the dna fragmentation assay indicated that butyric acid rapidly induced apoptosis in wehi 231 cells (with 1.25 mm butyric acid and 6 h after treatment), splenic b cells (with 1.25 mm butyric acid), and raji cells (with 2.5 mm butyric acid). incubation of wehi 231 cells with butyric  acid for 16 h resulted in the typical ladder pattern of dna fragmentation and the apoptoic change such as chromatin condensation and hypodiploid nuclei. cell cycle analysis implied that butyric acid arrested the cells at the g1 phase. the inhibitory assay suggested that butyric acid-induced apoptosis of wehi 231 and splenic b cells was inhibited by w-7, a calmodulin inhibitor. these results suggest that calmodulin-dependent regulation is involved in the signal transduction pathway of butyric acid.

TI  == acid tolerance and acid-neutralizing activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the tolerance to acid and the acid-neutralizing activity of three important periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum were studied. p. gingivalis strains grew only at neutral  ph and did not utilize glucose, whereas strains of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum could grow under acidic conditions and increased their growth by utilizing glucose. p. gingivalis tended to raise the culture ph during growth. p. intermedia and f. nucleatum raised the culture ph during growth in the absence of glucose, while in the presence of glucose they decreased the ph. resting cell suspensions of all the bacteria raised the ph in the presence of tryptone and casamino acids. acid-neutralizing activity was confirmed by measuring base production at a fixed ph with a ph-stat. during neutralization, the cells produced cytotoxic substrates, ammonia and organic acids (butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acids by p. gingivalis; isovaleric and succinic acids by p. intermedia; propionic and butyric acids by f. nucleatum). these findings suggest  that deamination of amino acids into ammonia and organic acids occurs simultaneously with base production, resulting in acid neutralization. these results could partially explain the survival of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in both supragingival and subgingival plaque and the apparent restriction of p. gingivalis to subgingival plaque. the former bacteria may aid in creation of an environment fostering colonization of subgingival plaque by p. gingivalis.

TI  == beta-sheet antibiotic peptides as potential dental therapeutics.
AB  == small, cysteine-rich, beta-sheet peptide antibiotics are found throughout the animalia. though broad spectrum in potential, they may exert selective antimicrobial effects under certain conditions. we have explored the antimicrobial properties of two families of beta-sheet peptide antibiotics, defensins and protegrins, against periodontopathic bacteria. the rabbit defensin  np-1 was active against facultative gram-negative bacteria associated with early  onset periodontitis, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the capnocytophaga spp. porcine protegrins showed even greater activity against those organisms, as well as against anaerobic bacteria associated with adult periodontitis, including porphyromonas gingivalis prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. based on these observations, we believe that protegrin-like beta-sheet peptide antibiotics may be useful dental therapeutics.

AB  == protegrins are broad spectrum antibiotic peptides isolated from porcine leukocytes. in this study, we (i) examine the sensitivity of gram-negative, anaerobic periodontal pathogens to synthetic protegrins; (ii) determine the relative potencies of protegrin congeners against these bacteria; and (iii) compare the potency of protegrins with other antibiotic peptides, including magainin msi-78, tachyplesin i, cecropin p1, human defensins hnp-1-3, and clavanin a. synthetic l- and d-enantiomers of protegrin 1 (pg-1 and d-pg-1, respectively), and l-enantiomers of protegrins 2, 3 and 5 (pg-2, pg-3 and pg-5) were tested against fusobacterium nucleatum, and black-pigmented organisms including porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. strains of both f.  nucleatum and the black-pigmented organisms were sensitive to pg-1, and exhibited mean ed99 of 2.2-2.3 micrograms/ml and 3.4-9.9 micrograms/ml, respectively. the d-form was statistically more potent than the l-form against these oral anaerobes, and although this difference in potency is unlikely to be of decisive  therapeutic significance, the d-form may be of value given ability to resist microbial and host-derived proteases. pg-1 was more potent than magainin, tachyplesin, cecropin, defensins and clavanin under test conditions. hypertonic salt concentrations and heat-inactivated serum were found to be inhibitory to the bactericidal activity of pg-1. pg-1 was found to induce morphologic alterations in the ultrastructural appearance of f. nucleatum consistent with damage to the bacterial membranes. we conclude that protegrins may be useful antimicrobial agents in therapy against gram-negative anaerobic bacteria believed to be involved in chronic, adult forms of periodontal infections.

TI  == subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis and  their susceptibility to minocycline-hcl.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-hcl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease  in bacterial susceptibility. twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. after subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-hcl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. the lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. the distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of minocycline-hcl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-hcl concentration equal to or less than the mic for reference strains. however, some clinical strains of prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. there were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. the concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque as related to periodontal and hiv infection status.
AB  == levels of total iga and specific iga reactive with streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by elisa in parotid saliva from hiv+ and hiv- persons with healthy gingiva (hg), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (cmp), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup). when the hiv+ group was compared with the hiv- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary iga concentration was higher in hiv+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total iga output. hiv+ cmp displayed higher total iga concentration as compared with hiv- cmp. no significant differences in specific iga outputs and ratios were detected  between hiv+ and hiv- subgroups with similar periodontal status. hiv+ nup displayed increased specific iga output towards s. mutans and increased specific  iga ratio values towards s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ cmp, and increased specific iga ratio values towards s. mutans and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ hg. no such differences were observed between the hiv- subgroups. in sum, salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and hiv infection, but are  possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.

TI  == subgingival temperature: relation to gingival crevicular fluid enzymes, cytokines, and subgingival plaque micro-organisms.
AB  == there have been no reports on the relationship of subgingival temperature to specific gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) components. therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether there was any relationship between subgingival temperature and gcf levels of neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), beta-glucuronidase (bg), interleukin-1 alpha (il-1), and interferon alpha (ifn). furthermore, another objective was to confirm an association of subgingival temperature with clinical parameters and specific subgingival plaque micro-organisms as has been reported earlier. 27 human subjects each having healthy (n = 50), gingivitis (n = 59) and periodontitis (n = 53) sites were evaluated. the plaque index (pi), subgingival temperature, probing depth, attachment loss, bleeding index and gingival index were measured. gcf was  sampled following the measurement of the pi and removal of the supragingival plaque. gcf samples were assayed for the enzymes ne, bg, mpo and the cytokines ifn-alpha and il-1 alpha. a sterile gracey curette was utilized at each sampled site to collect subgingival plaque. the plaque samples were evaluated using an immunoassay. subgingival temperature was found to directly correlate with all clinical parameters (p < 0.001). significant, albeit not large, correlations were found between subgingival temperature and ne (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), mpo (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and bg (r = 0.23, p < 0.01). temperature was found to correlate  positively with e. corrodens (r = 0.33, p < 0.02) and f. nucleatum (r = 0.25, p < 0.05) but not with p. intermedia (r = 0.02, p = 0.9), p. gingivalis (r = 0.20, p  = 0.1) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (r = 0.01, p > 0.9). in conclusion, subgingival temperature is correlated with the gcf enzymes, ne, mpo and bg as well as the clinical parameters and specific plaque micro-organisms associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == reduced serum igg reactivities with bacteria from dental plaque in hiv-infected persons with periodontitis.
AB  == serum samples were obtained from 44 hiv-seropositive (hiv+) and 37 hiv-seronegative (hiv-) persons that were grouped according to periodontal status. serum igg and iga reactivities towards streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis. prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by means of elisa. hiv+ persons with chronic marginal periodontitis showed significantly lower igg reactivities to the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum as compared  with their hiv- counterparts (p < 0.05). specific serum iga reactivities were similar in the two periodontitis groups, except for p. nigrescens where the hiv+  group with chronic marginal periodontitis had lower values than their systemically healthy counterparts (p < 0.05). the results indicate that hiv infection affects the humoral serum immune responses against bacteria in dental plaque; the depressed antibody responses may contribute to the increased susceptibility for periodontal infections in hiv-infected patients.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == identification of a fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 galactose-binding adhesin which mediates coaggregation with periopathogenic bacteria and hemagglutination.
AB  == attachment of fusobacterium nucleatum to various oral surfaces is mediated by several adhesins anchored on its outer surface. monoclonal antibodies (mabs) were prepared and used to identify the putative galactose-binding adhesin of f. nucleatum pk1594. four unique mabs, 8g7, 26b9, 28g11, and 29d4, were isolated on  the basis of their ability to inhibit coaggregation of f. nucleatum pk1594 with porphyromonas gingivalis pk1924. all four mabs were also capable of inhibiting galactose-inhibitable interactions of f. nucleatum pk1594 with other oral gram-negative bacteria and with erythrocytes. preincubation of f. nucleatum pk1594 with mab 26b9 or its fab fragments at concentrations lower than 1 microg/ml resulted in complete inhibition of coaggregation with p. gingivalis pk1924 or hemagglutination. f. nucleatum pk1594 surface components prepared by mild sonication or by extracting whole cells with detergents were subjected to western blot analysis. none of the mabs were able to recognize any polypeptide in these experiments. therefore, detergent extracts of f. nucleatum pk1594 surface components were subjected to three experimental procedures: (i) separation by ion-exchange chromatography and testing of fractions for reaction with mab 26b9 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), (ii) lactose-sepharose affinity  chromatography and testing of the lactose eluate in elisa with mab 26b9, and (iii) immunoseparation with either mab 26b9 or 8g7. collectively, the results suggest that the putative adhesin is a 30-kda outer membrane polypeptide which mediates the coaggregation with p. gingivalis pk1924 as well as other galactose-sensitive interactions of f. nucleatum pk1594.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of young adults with and without early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the associations between putative periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis (eop) in a population of 248 subjects, 13 to 19 years of age at baseline, derived from a representative sample of u.s. young adults. the subjects were selected based on the presence or absence of attachment loss at baseline. the attachment level was assessed clinically at baseline and at a 6-year follow-up examination, and the presence of 7 bacterial species was assessed at follow-up using dna probes. the individuals were classified into generalized, localized, incidental eop, and no-periodontitis groups based on the  extent and severity of attachment loss; and classified as having rapid, moderate, slow, and no progression based on the rate of periodontal progression during the  6 preceding years. in the eop groups there were significantly higher percentages  of individuals with detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola. in addition, the eop group had significantly higher levels of these 5  microorganisms compared to the no-periodontitis group. there were also higher percentages of individuals with these species and higher levels of bacteria in the group showing disease progression than the group without progression. in a descending order of importance, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and p. intermedia were the microorganisms significantly associated with the generalized and/or rapidly progressing disease. f. nucleatum and c. rectus were also associated with eop, but to a lesser degree. in the present population actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not significantly associated with eop, though it was recovered more often from subjects with localized eop. eikenella corrodens was present equally in subjects with and without disease. the results show that several bacterial species are associated with eop, and that p. gingivalis and t.  denticola are of particular importance and may play a significant role in the more severe and progressive forms of eop.

TI  == experimental gingivitis in periodontitis-susceptible subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical, microbiological, and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) profiles in periodontitis-resistant and periodontitis-susceptible subjects during 4 weeks of experimental gingivitis. experimental groups of similar ages were defined as gingivitis controls (gc; n =  10) and history of rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp; n = 10), respectively. prior to baseline, all subjects achieved good plaque control (plaque index (p1i)  approximately 0) and gingival health (gingival index (gi) = 0), and had probing depths < or = 4 mm on experimental teeth. for 4 weeks after baseline, oral hygiene around maxillary 2nd premolar and 1st molar teeth was inhibited by a plaque guard. the plaque guard was removed weekly for gcf sampling to determine interleukin (il)-1 beta and prostaglandin (pg)e2 amounts by elisas. in addition,  p1i, gi, probing depth, and gingival recession measurements were made. subgingival plaque darkfield microscopy and dna probe analysis also were performed. results indicated that clinical signs of inflammation, microbiological patterns and gcf profiles progressed similarly in both groups. however, plaque accumulated more rapidly in the susceptible subjects. p1i in rpp at 4 weeks was 2.1 +/- 0.1 compared to 1.5 +/- 0.2 in gc, with an incidence of p1i > of 100% versus 50%, respectively (logistic regression; p < 0.0001). hence, the clinical,  microbiological and host factors selected for this study were unrelated to previous susceptibility to periodontitis when evaluated in the experimental gingivitis model. however, the increased rate of plaque accumulation, following thorough plaque removal, in rpp patients suggests a potential factor in disease recurrence in these susceptible subjects.

TI  == dental implant infections.
AB  == dental implants provide a restorative tool to support crowns, bridge abutments, and removable dentures. osseointegrated implants are titanium posts that are surgically implanted in alveolar bone. a tight immobile bond (osseointegration) forms between bone and titanium, and prosthetic and restorative fixtures are attached to the implants. titanium implants differ from natural teeth, which may  make them more susceptible to mechanical stress. a small proportion of implants are not successful and may fail due to infection. the microbiota of implants is similar to that of teeth in similar clinical states. implants that fail because of mechanical stress are colonized by species associated with healthy teeth. infected implants are colonized by subgingival species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, and peptostreptococcus micros. different patients may be colonized by different microbial complexes, indicating that optimal treatment should be directed to the specific infection.

TI  == characteristics of systemic antibody responses of nonhuman primates to cell envelope and cell wall antigens from periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the immune response of the primate, macaca fascicularis, to cell envelope (cea) or cell wall (cwa) antigens of several periodontal pathogens was examined to develop a strategy to interfere with ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were parenterally immunized with cea of either porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia or a combination of cea/cwa of campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces viscosus. serum samples were taken every 2-4 weeks over a 4-month period, which included a 13-week interval with molar teeth ligated. all of the nonhuman primates in the study exhibited baseline levels of igg, igm and iga antibody to formalinized whole cells of the bacteria. these levels increased  significantly following immunization and were elevated above baseline throughout  the remainder of the experiment. the largest change in antibody responses was seen in iga antibody levels of p. gingivalis and c. rectus (42-fold above baseline), igm antibody to p. intermedia, (41-fold increase) and igg antibody to  f. nucleatum and a. viscosus (32 and 63-fold increases). moreover, the nonhuman primates exhibited differences in isotype response levels to whole microorganisms compared with the cell envelope antigens. these findings demonstrate the capacity of these nonhuman primates to produce an active immune response to microorganisms chronically colonizing the subgingival microbiota. additionally, it appears that  the bacteria may exhibit some unique differences in their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate and may contribute to the ability of the immune  responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.

TI  == evidence for serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody responses in macaca fascicularis identified by monoclonal antibodies to human igg subclasses.
AB  == this investigation determined the capacity of murine monoclonal antibodies directed to human immunoglobulin g (igg) subclasses to identify molecules with conserved epitopes in the serum of the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis. we  subsequently utilized this cross-reactivity to document the characteristics of igg subclass antibody responses in m. fascicularis to parenteral immunization with intact oral microorganisms, antigens from oral microorganisms, and finally a defined protein toxin, tetanus toxoid. the igg response in nonhuman primates immunized with tetanus toxoid showed a 40-fold and 110-fold increase after primary and secondary immunizations, respectively. the major igg subclass responses were igg1 and igg3, with little, though significant, responses in the igg4 and igg2 subclasses. seventy-five to 94% of the natural igg antibody in nonhuman primate sera to porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was igg1. igg2 and igg3 predominated to bacteroides fragilis, igg4 to actinomyces viscosus and an equal distribution among the subclasses was noted in response to fusobacterium nucleatum. parenteral immunization of nonhuman primates with intact p. gingivalis elicited primarily igg3 and igg4, while the post-immunization igg response to p. intermedia was largely igg1. nonhuman primates were also parenterally immunized with cell envelope antigens of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, or a combination of cell envelope antigen from c. rectus and f. nucleatum and cell wall antigens of a. viscosus. the greatest igg antibody response seen post-immunization was reactive  with anti-human igg1 for all of these antigens except to c. rectus which bound nonhuman primate antibody reactive with anti-human igg2. it appears that the bacteria and their products exhibit unique differences in their induction of serum igg subclass antibody responses. the characteristics of their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate may contribute to the ability  of the immune responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.

TI  == beta-lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  == in 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. in addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (dryslide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. based on the non-selective plates, six  of 23 p. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 b. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 f. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. the beta-lactamase positive species prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, prevotella buccalis and actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range  < 0.01-15%). comparison of the dryslide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory  test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). it was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a  common feature. however, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level  enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. the majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found  among species of the prevotella genus.

TI  == host modulation of tissue destruction caused by periodontopathogens: effects on a mixed microbial infection composed of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum.
AB  == these studies determined the ability of selected periodontopathogens to synergistically initiate soft tissue destruction in a murine abscess model. the development of immunity following recovery from infection or by active immunization was also examined. mice were infected with p. gingivalis w50, f. nucleatum t18, or a combination of the two microorganisms. f. nucleatum caused only a localized lesion in contrast to p. gingivalis which caused a spreading suppurative inflammatory lesion of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, which, depending upon the dose, could result in death. infection of mice with a combination of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum elicited a significantly greater lesion size (p<0.001) and lethality compared with p. gingivalis alone. mice infected with a subclinical dose (no visible lesion) of p. gingivalis failed to develop protective immunity to a secondary p. gingivalis challenge. mice that had recovered from p. gingivalis lesions demonstrated partial protection against subsequent p. gingivalis challenge; however, the immunity was less protective against the mixed f. nucleatum + p. gingivalis infection. active immunization with p. gingivalis protected against both the p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum + p. gingivalis challenges and this protection was correlated with the levels of specific serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody. the results indicated that the murine model is ideally suited to examine bacterially-mediated mixed infections that result in soft tissue destruction. this destruction can be minimized, but not abrogated, with development of immunity. challenge with sufficient numbers of the pathogens can overwhelm the acquired immunity.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == occurrence of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth: microbiological findings.
AB  == bacterial invasion in roots of periodontally diseased teeth, which has been recently documented using cultural and microscopic techniques, may be important in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. the purpose of this investigation was to determine the occurrence and the species of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth. samples were taken from the middle layer  of radicular dentin of 26 periodontally diseased teeth. 14 healthy teeth were used as controls. dentin samples were cultured anaerobically. the chosen methodology allowed the determination of the numbers of bacteria present in both  deeper and outer part of dentinal tubules, and the bacterial concentration in dentin samples, expressed as colony forming units per mg of tissue (cfu/mg). invading bacteria was detected in 14 (53.8%) samples from periodontally diseased  teeth. the bacterial concentration ranged from 831.84 to 11971.3 cfu/mg (mean+/-standard deviation: 3043.15+/-2763.13). micro-organisms identified included putative periodontal pathogens such as prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus, peptostreptococcus micros and streptococcus intermedius. these findings suggest that radicular dentin could act as bacterial reservoir from which periodontal pathogens can recolonize treated periodontal pockets, contributing to the failure of therapy and recurrence of disease.

AB  == the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-gabhs tonsillitis. antibody titres to four gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. an average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in gabhs tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-gabhs tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. there were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both gabhs  and non-gabhs groups. these bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, peptostreptococcus spp., f. nucleatum, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. significantly higher antibodies levels to  f. nucleatum and p. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients  with non-gabhs pharyngo-tonsillitis (p < 0.001) and gabhs tonsillitis (p < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. the  increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-gabhs and gabhs tonsillitis.

TI  == characterization of bacteroides forsythus isolates.
AB  == fifteen bacteroides forsythus strains freshly isolated from patients with periodontitis were used together with three collection strains and one type strain for characterization of growth on various media; determination of enzymatic profiles, antibiotic susceptibility profiles, 16s rrna ribotypes, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) outer membrane protein profiles, and pathogenicity; and gas chromatography analysis by  using a wound chamber model in rabbits. all strains were stimulated by n-acetylmuramic acid, while one strain needed a further supplement such as yeast  extract for optimal growth. all strains showed trypsin-like activity. while 10 different ribotypes were found, the sds-page profiles revealed similar patterns for all strains. all strains were sensitive to penicillin g (mics, <0.5 microg/ml), ampicillin (mics, <1.0 microg/ml), amoxicillin (mics, <0.38 microg/ml), metronidazole (mics, <0.005 microg/ml), tetracycline (mics, <0.19 microg/ml), doxycycline (mics, 0.05 microg/ml), erythromycin (mics, <0.4 microg/ml), and clindamycin (mics, <0.016 microg/ml), while they were less sensitive to ciprofloxacin (mics, <4 microg/ml). b. forsythus did not cause abscess formation by monoinoculation. b. forsythus coinoculated with fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 caused abscess formation in 75% of rabbits, while it caused abscess formation in 100% of rabbits when it was coinoculated with porphyromonas gingivalis fdc 381. in the case of the latter combination, four of six rabbits died of sepsis after 6 to 7 days, and p. gingivalis and b. forsythus were recovered from the heart blood at a proportion of 10:1. b. forsythus strains were highly virulent and invasive in combination with p. gingivalis.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == development of resistance to metronidazole and minocycline in vitro.
AB  == by local delivery of antibiotics to periodontal pockets, very high initial concentrations are often quickly succeeded by subinhibitory concentrations, which may facilitate development of bacterial resistance. the purpose of the present study was to investigate possible development of resistance in suspected periodontal pathogens after exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of metronidazole and minocycline. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 18 reference strains and 12 clinical isolates was determined by a broth dilution method. subsequently, all strains with mic < 8 micrograms/ml were exposed to serial passage on plates containing subinhibitory and gradually increasing concentrations of antibiotics, until growth was inhibited. initially, most strains were inhibited at < or = 0.250 microgram/ml of minocycline and < or = 0.5 microgram/ml of metronidazole, though a. actinomycetemcomitans was resistant to metronidazole. after growth at subinhibitory concentrations, 8 strains survived 1-2 x and 11 stains survived 8-32 x their initial mic of metronidazole, growing at up to 8 micrograms/ml. all a. actinomycetemcomitans survived 8-64 x their initial mic of minocycline, growing at > or = 2 micrograms/ml, while all other strains were inhibited at < or = 0.250 microgram/ml, corresponding to a 1-8 x increase in their initial mic. thus, development of resistance was observed for periodontal bacteria growing at up to 64 x their initial mic, but the final level of resistance was moderate.

TI  == release and activation of human neutrophil matrix metallo- and serine proteinases during phagocytosis of fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == the phagocytic ingestion of reference strains and clinical isolates of fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) and the concomitant release of pmn granule proteinases were studied by specific functional and immunological assays. pmns were incubated with the microorganisms anaerobically at 37 degrees c for indicated time periods. the suspensions and pellets were used for phagocytic ingestion assay and electron microscopic study, respectively. the supernatants were used for the measurements of the amounts and activities of the released pmn  enzymes including pmn gelatinase (mmp-9), collagenase (mmp-8), serine proteases (elastase and cathepsin g), and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). both fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were ingested by the pmns in comparable numbers. however, measurements of the enzymes released from the triggered pmns revealed major differences among the three species. high amount of elastase was released from the pmns triggered by f. nucleatum, but not by p. gingivalis or t. denticola. the treatment of pmns with p. gingivalis whole cells resulted in the release of gelatinase partly in the 82 kd active form, suggesting proteolytic activation of the degranulated 92 kd prommp-9. the 82 kd active form of gelatinase was not detected upon triggering the pmns with f. nucleatum and t. denticola. the pmn-bacteria interaction did not result in release of ldh from triggered pmns indicating the proteinase release was not due to the pmn cell death. the results show that the susceptibilities of the 3 potentially periodontopathogenic microorganisms, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and t. denticola to phagocytic ingestion are not directly related to the amounts and activities of pmn enzymes released during the bacteria-pmn interactions. as pmn degranulation is considered as one of the major pathogenic mechanisms in periodontitis, the observed differences among the microorganisms may be important virulence characteristics of these species.

TI  == secretion of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, il-8 and il-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. it was recently demonstrated that pmn have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these  capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. we therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-8 and il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) secreted by pmn from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea and fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium escherichia coli. a actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. coli lps stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 than the control unstimulated pmn (p < 0.01). the levels of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 released from cells stimulated with p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans or e. coli lps (p < 0.05). on the other hand, substantially greater amounts of il-1ra were released from pmn stimulated with each lps and from control unstimulated pmn during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of il-1ra were secreted by pmn stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans and e.coli lps during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). the inhibitory effects of il-1ra on the biological activity of il-1 in the supernatants of pmn were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. the supernatants of pmn stimulated with each lps showed less biological il-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human il-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of pmn stimulated with  p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps. these findings demonstrated that lps from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating pmn to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as il-1ra. different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various lps might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.

TI  == possible lethal enhancement of toxins from putative periodontopathogens by nicotine: implications for periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: to test the hypothesis that lethal synergy in the chick embryo model may occur between nicotine and bacterial products (cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates) of five putative periodontopathogens. methods: the lethality of cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates of five periodontal species was assessed with or without nicotine in the chick embryo assay system. ten putative  periodontopathogens (five species) were studied: prevotella intermedia (n = 5), porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 1), porphyromonas asaccharolytica (n = 1), fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 2), and fusobacterium necrophorum (n = 1). results:  simultaneous testing of cell-free extracellular toxins from isolates w50, ps2, ps3, ps4, and ps5 and nicotine resulted in a percentage kill significantly greater than expected (fisher's exact test). simultaneous testing of cell lysates from isolates w50, ps2, and ps5 and nicotine resulted in a percentage kill significantly greater than expected (fisher's exact test). conclusions: lethal synergy in the chick embryo model may occur between nicotine and toxins from putative periodontopathogens (both cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates). this may be an important mechanism by which smoking increases the severity of periodontal disease.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == evidence for genetic control of changes in f-actin polymerization caused by pathogenic microorganisms: in vitro assessment using gingival fibroblasts from human twins.
AB  == attachment to and migration upon a substratum, as well as other functions of connective tissue cells, are regulated mainly by cytoplasmic structural proteins, particularly filamentous actin (f-actin). pathogenic microorganisms exert negative effects on cytoskeletal proteins. in the present study, normal gingival  fibroblasts from 10 sets of human twins (6 fraternal, dz; 4 identical, mz) were exposed to soluble extracts from porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum, then f-actin was stained using fitc-labeled phalloidin. cells were examined under fluorescence, and a computer-assisted image analyzer quantitated f-actin polymerization as fluorescence intensity on a per-cell basis. intraclass  correlation coefficients for f-actin in mz/mz vis-a-vis dz/dz paired cell cultures were determined to assess the possible heritability of responses to the  microorganism preparations. f-actin labeling was significantly different between  control cultures and those exposed to the extracts. both f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis effected f-actin and fibroblast morphology. when the data were adjusted for gender and age effects, and for differences in control f-actin levels, fibroblasts from mz twin pairs were moderately similar in both absolute and relative responses to bacterial challenges; cells from dz twins showed little similarity when response was measured on the absolute scale, and moderate similarity using the relative scale.

TI  == short-chain carboxylic acid concentration in human gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == short-chain carboxylic acids (e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which can accumulate in the gingival crevice. it is of no small consequence, therefore, that 1- to 5-mm concentrations of these acids exhibit significant biological activity, including  the ability to alter cell proliferation and gene expression in cells of importance to the periodontium. this communication reports on the in vivo concentrations of propionic and butyric acid in the gingival crevices of periodontal subjects with severe and mild disease. the results indicated that severely diseased subjects exhibited a > 10-fold increase in the mm concentration of these acids when compared with mildly diseased subjects (mean propionic acid-severe = 9.5 +/- 1.8 mm, and mild = 0.8 +/- 0.3 mm; mean butyric acid-severe = 2.6 +/- 0.4 mm, and mild = 0.2 +/- 0.04 mm). these differences (mean +/- se) were significant (p < 0.0001). the propionic and butyric acid concentrations were below detection limits in healthy sites of mildly diseased subjects. the propionic and butyric acid concentrations also associated significantly with clinical measures of disease severity (e.g., pocket depth, attachment level) and  inflammation (e.g., subgingival temperature, % of sites bleeding when probed), and with the total microbial load (all p < 0.05). taken together, these data suggest that short-chain carboxylic acids play a mediating role in periodontal disease pathogenesis.

AB  == the hypothesis that teeth act as reservoirs of micro-organisms for the colonization of oral implants has recently been stated several times. the present study aimed at examining, in partially edentulous patients with severe periodontitis, whether pockets around teeth and implants harbored a comparable micro-flora. in 6 patients (3 with refractory periodontitis and 3 with advanced chronic adult periodontitis), plaque samples were taken from a deep and shallow pocket around both teeth and implants for differential phase contrast microscopy  and dna probe analysis. the results showed important differences in the sub-gingival flora between the 2 disease groups, as well as between deep and shallow pockets, around both implants and teeth. on the other hand, when pockets  around teeth and implants with equal depths were compared a striking similarity was observed in the microbial composition. these observations confirm the hypothesis that pockets around teeth act as a reservoir and highlight the importance of periodontal health when oral implants are planned.

AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

TI  == the adherence of periodontopathogens to periodontal probes. a possible factor in  intra-oral transmission?
AB  == periodontal probes have previously been shown to harbor several bacterial types or species after probing periodontally diseased pockets. this study aims to identify and quantify periodontopathogens that may adhere to a periodontal probe  by culturing techniques. it also examines the probe's roughness on its capability to collect bacteria, comparing merrit-b probes (with deep indentations) with tps  probes (with smooth surfaces). from the differential phase contrast microscopy findings it was seen that, while paper-points harbored nearly 50% motile rods or  spirochetes, the periodontal probes were just at, or below, the 20% threshold level for pathogenicity (23.6% for the merrit-b probe and 11.3% for the tps probe). the cultural data showed that paper-points had significantly higher (p <  0.05) numbers of anaerobic bacteria than the 2 probe types, which still harbored  up to 10(7) cfu. no significant differences could be detected between the probes. when specific periodontopathic species were considered, it was seen that for all  species, even for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis, the detection frequency was comparable for the 3 sampling devices. however, the levels of prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was significantly higher in samples from paper-points (p < 0.05), but still their numbers reached even 10(5) on the probes. differences among the 2 probe types were again negligible. periodontal probes harbor relatively high numbers of bacteria found in periodontal pockets and may be able to carry them over to other sites. further studies are needed to determine if, and to what extent, transmission occurs during periodontal probing.

TI  == risk indicators for periodontal disease in a racially diverse urban population.
AB  == a cross-sectional study of 117 subjects from a dental clinic serving a diverse population (i.e., whites, african-americans, native-americans, and asians) was performed to evaluate risk indicators of periodontal disease. gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and subgingival plaque were taken at the same visit from 4 posterior  sites of the most diseased sextant in each subject. age, smoking packyears, beta-glucuronidase (beta g), neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum), and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) were significantly (p < 0.05-0.005) correlated with attachment loss.  probing depth was significantly correlated with smoking packyears, beta g, ne, mpo, f. nucleatum and prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia) (p < 0.05-0.005). mean ne value of whites was lower than the mean ne values of african-americans, native-americans and asians (p < 0.05). whites had a lower mean beta g value compared to african americans, and a lower mean mpo value compared to african americans and native americans. the %s of patients positive for f. nucleatum, p.  intermedia and eikenella corrodens (e. corrodens) were higher in native americans compared to whites. step-wise multiple regression analysis was performed to construct models for the estimation of probing depth and attachment loss. the most parsimonious regression models which had the best r2 values included the following variables and accounted for the indicated % of variability: models 1 and 2: beta g, race, and f. nucleatum accounted for 50% of the variability in mean probing depth and 39% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for  probing depth, respectively; model 3: age, beta g, and f. nucleatum accounted for 53% of the variability in mean attachment loss; model 4: age, ne, and f. nucleatum explained 35% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for attachment loss. the results suggest that age, race, smoking packyears, beta g, ne, mpo, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are risk indicators for periodontal disease in this racially diverse urban population. regression models  which include multiple variables (i.e., demographic factors, gcf enzymes and periodontopathic bacteria) can be used to estimate periodontal disease status.

AB  == the major outer membrane protein, foma, of the gram-negative human oral pathogen  fusobacterium nucleatum functions as a porin and is assumed to act as a receptor  protein in coaggregation with other oral pathogenic bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis. we describe here the cloning  of foma from f. nucleatum in e. coli. using pgem3zf(+), three recombinant plasmids were carrying parts of the foma gene, but none of these contained regions upstream of the coding sequence. from these plasmids a clone was constructed which contained the whole foma gene. the atcc 10953 foma gene was cloned under the phosphate limitation-inducible phoe promoter, using a vector derived from pacyc184. the protein was found to be incorporated into the outer membrane of the host in an apparently normal manner, as judged by heat-modifiability, trypsin-accessibility, and accessibility to antibodies to the protein in a whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the cloned foma was found to exhibit pore-forming activity.

AB  == to determine the effect of pathogenic oral bacteria on interleukin 6 (il-6) and soluble il-6 receptor production, we measured their release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes (monocyte depleted), pure t cells, or monocytes were cultured with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum or porphyromonas gingivalis for  24 h. supernatants were tested for il-6 and soluble il-6 receptor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. only monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells responded with significant il-6 release in the presence of all  bacteria tested. however, peripheral blood lymphocytes were capable of producing  il-6 when activated by phytohemagglutinin or il-2 followed by bacteria, though substantially less than cultures containing monocytes. no bacteria tested increased soluble il-6 receptor release over spontaneous soluble il-6 receptor release. we conclude that monocytes release il-6 after contact with oral pathogens; however, soluble il-6 receptor from t cells and monocytes is constitutively produced and may modulate il-6 actions.

TI  == serum rheumatoid factor induced by intraperitoneal administration of periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharide in mice.
AB  == serum rheumatoid factor (rf) level and peritoneal and splenic cd5+b (b-1) cells in mice were examined after intraperitoneal administration of purified lipopoly-saccharides (lps) from oral periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga ochracea. f. nucleatum and c. ochracea lps induced higher levels of serum igm- and igg-rf, while p. gingivalis lps showed the least induction. in  addition, wet weights of spleen and serum igm and igg concentration were markedly increased in f. nucleatum lps injected group. on the other hand, the proportion of cd5+ b cells to lymphocytes in the peritoneal cavity and spleen did not increase. the reason for this was not clear but conventional b cells (cd5- b cells) might increase more rapidly with splenic enlargement than cd5+ b cells. these results suggested that rf induced by bacterial lps may modulate immune responses against bacteria and plays an important role for defence and destruction of periodontal tissue.

TI  == strong cytotoxicity to human gingival fibroblasts by porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the cytotoxicity of some bacterial species associated with periodontal diseases. the specificity of cytotoxicity was estimated against cells of various origin and from different individuals. the reference bacteria were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. these bacteria were cultured for 24 h in  liquid media and the supernatants were used in cytotoxicity assays. the target cells used were human gingival fibroblasts (gf), dermal fibroblasts (k4), gingival epithelial cells (e) and hela-cells (hela). these cells were exposed at  4 h or 24 h, respectively, to various concentrations of culture supernatants from the selected bacteria. the influence on the viability and metabolism of the cells were estimated quantitatively as increase in neutral red uptake and lactic acid production. growth medium supernatants of p. gingivalis 33277 were strongly cytotoxic to gingival fibroblasts after 24 h incubation, compared to supernatants of p. gingivalis 381 or w 50, a. actinomycetemcomitans or f. nucleatum cultures.  the toxic effect of p. gingivalis 33277 decreased drastically after heat inactivation, which indicates effects of proteins. by adding anti-sera the cytotoxicity of p. gingivalis 33277 could be dose dependently neutralized, which  was not the case when supernatants of a. actino-mycetemcomitans was tested. target cells of epithelial origin did not show increased cytotoxicity to p. gingivalis 33277. the results of the present study strengthen the hypothesis that p. gingivalis remains as a suspect causative key component in periodontal diseases.

TI  == selling biotechnology in the dental medicine marketplace: the omnigene diagnostics dna probe tests for periodontal pathogens.
AB  == omnigene diagnostics, inc. has applied the principles of genetic engineering to develop species-specific dna probe tests for eight periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetem-comitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola). the test requires minimal effort on the part of the clinician: subgingival plaque samples  are collected from the patient and sent through the mail for analysis by omnigene diagnostics' fully licensed clinical reference laboratory. results are transmitted to the practitioner by phone, fax, or mail. the use of diagnostic tests for periodontal pathogens is a relatively new concept in dentistry and acceptance of the omnigene diagnostics tests by the dental marketplace has been slower than anticipated. omnigene diagnostics' challenge for the future is to persuade the dental community that monitoring periodontal pathogen levels, as well as other clinical indicators of disease, is essential to providing optimal care to the periodontitis patient.

TI  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  == infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, mrsa,  and candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. we enumerated mrsa and c. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. staphylococcus species, mrsa, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, mrse, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. c. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. all saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried staphylococcus species and c. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. adherence of isolated 3h labeled cells of mrsa and c. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher  numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. the hydrophobicity of the mrsa isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of c.  albicans strains was moderately high. the zeta potentials of mrsa isolates and of c. albicans isolates determined in kci buffer were significantly low. the potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. two out of 5  mrsa strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of staphylococcus species. no isolates of c. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the  oral bacteria tested. isolates of mrsa and c. albicans coaggregated with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum strains. using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of staphylococcus species or c. albicans organisms in saliva.

TI  == the relationship of gingival crevicular fluid short chain carboxylic acid concentration to gingival inflammation.
AB  == short-chain carboxylic acids (scca; c < or = 5; e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which accumulate in the gingival crevice, and exhibit significant biological activity,  including the ability to alter gene expression. it has been hypothesized that among the activities of sccas are their ability to contribute to gingival inflammation. this concept complements the notion that specific periodontal pathogens are the causative agents of gingival inflammation. to begin testing these 2 hypotheses, we examined the relationship between scca concentrations, specific putative periodontal pathogens, and gingival inflammation in medically healthy periodontally diseased subjects. we reasoned that if sccas and/or specific periodontal pathogens were causative gingival inflammatory agents, gingival inflammation should increase with increasing concentration of the inflammatory mediator. we also recognized that other clinical variables needed to be controlled for, and an objective quantitative assessment of gingival inflammation used. to accomplish these tasks, sites within subjects were stratified by location and pocket depth, and the following quantified: bacterial  presence; scca concentration; and gingival inflammation. the results indicated that gingival inflammation directly and significantly correlated with scca concentrations in the maxillary and mandibular molars, incisors and canines (all  r > or = 0.47; all p < or = 0.015; too few bicuspids were available for complete  analysis). the relationship between gingival inflammation and scca concentration  was best described by a natural log relationship. gingival inflammation did not,  however, correlate positively with either the total number of specific putative periodontal pathogens, or the sum of subsets of these pathogens (-0.31 < or = r < or = 0.39; 0.08 < or = p < or = 0.75) for any of the locations. finally, the scca concentration did not correlate with the level of individual or groups of pathogens. these data, together with historical work and other preliminary data,  support the hypothesis that scca, rather than specific putative periodontal pathogens, may be a causative agent in gingival inflammation. this work may, in part, begin to explain the apparent lack of a direct relationship between current gingival inflammation and the prediction of bacterially mediated periodontal attachment loss.

TI  == evaluation of the long-term efficacy and safety of locally-applied minocycline in adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to establish in a long-term investigation the safety as well as the clinical and microbiological efficacy of  scaling and rootplaning combined with local application of 2% minocycline hydrochloride-gel versus placebo-gel in patients with moderate to severe chronic  adult periodontitis. this was an 18 months, randomized, double-blind, parallel, comparative study, in which 20 healthy patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis participated. at baseline, all patients received professional oral  hygiene-instruction and supra- and subgingival scaling and root planing. the minocycline-gel was applied subgingivally baseline, 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. microbiological evaluation was carried out using dmdx to identify the following bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola. in addition standard microbiological techniques were used for the detection of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, c. albicans and enterobacteriaceae. results showed a statistically significant improvement for all clinical parameters irrespective of the treatment modality. no differences were observed between test and control with regard to probing depth and attachment level. the dmdx data showed a significant reduction in both the numbers and the prevalence over the 15 months period, but no significant difference between groups. culture data showed that at baseline two-third were positive for p. gingivalis and p. intermedia. analysis over the 18 month period showed no significant difference between the two treatment modalities. c. albicans and enterobacteriaceae were detected only in small proportions at each time interval in a limited number of patients. no adverse reactions were observed during the trial period. the present patient group responded favourably to scaling and rootplaning, but did not benefit from an effect of local of minocycline. subgingival debridement in combination with oral hygiene instruction by itself has been shown to be effective. it remains to be studied whether local  application of minocycline can be effective as an adjunct to mechanical therapy in sites that respond poorly to conventional treatment.

TI  == the effect of chlorhexidine on defined, mixed culture oral biofilms grown in a novel model system.
AB  == in order to develop an improved method to evaluate antimicrobial agents for use in clinical dentistry, a constant-depth film fermenter (cdff) has been used to generate biofilms of fixed depth comprising nine species of bacteria commonly found in dental plaque in health and disease. these bacteria were grown together  initially in a conventional chemostat which was used to inoculate the cdff over an 8 h period. medium was then supplied directly to the cdff and biofilms allowed to develop. the biofilms were then challenged with eight short pulses of two concentrations of chlorhexidine (0.0125 and 0.125% w/v). the lower concentration  had a limited effect on the composition of the biofilms while a differential and  substantial inhibition was obtained with a higher concentration. actinomyces naeslundii was lost from the biofilm, and the viable counts of streptococci, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis were inhibited by over three orders of magnitude by 0.125% chlorhexidine, whereas veillonella dispar was only  transiently affected. the findings were consistent with those from clinical studies of dental plaque, suggesting that this model would have a predictive value when evaluating novel antiplaque or antimicrobial inhibitors.

TI  == induction of systemic murine b-cell responses by fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the antigenic abilities of fusobacterium nucleatum strain atcc 25586 and porphyromonas gingivalis strain w50 black inbred  balb/cabom mice immunized subcutaneously. furthermore, we aimed to analyze whether the outer membranes (om) and whole cells (wc) of f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis had an effect on the levels of antibody response and whether a combination of both could either enhance or suppress the b-cell response. a single-cell assay, solid-phase enzyme-linked immunospot (elispot), was used to analyze the splenic b-cell response (immunoglobulin a (iga), igg and igm). enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and immunoblotting were used to verify  the specific antibody response in the sera. a statistically significant lower level of spontaneous antibody production was observed in the group immunized with p. gingivalis om compared with groups immunized with f. nucleatum and saline. the specific antibody titers measured by elisa indicated that the bacterial preparations were able to induce igg and igm response. the preparations containing p. gingivalis om induced higher humoral response than the preparations containing p. gingivalis wc, but for f. nucleatum such a difference was not observed. the prominent proteins revealed had apparent molecular masses of 40 kda for f. nucleatum and 115, 55-56 and 43 kda for p. gingivalis; whereas the immunoreactive proteins were 70, 65 and 40 kda for mice immunized with f. nucleatum and 115, 55-56, 43 and 33-34 kda for mice immunized with p. gingivalis. quantitative analysis of b-cell response at the single cell level with elispot revealed that some component(s) of p. gingivalis om may have a suppressive ability on splenocytes incubated for a short time.

TI  == treatment of periodontal disease based on microbiological diagnosis. relation between microbiological and clinical parameters during 5 years.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the clinical effect of treatment aimed to suppress actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis below  detection level and prevotella intermedia below 5% of the cultivable periodontal  pocket flora. sixteen patients and a total of 111 periodontal pockets with probing depth > or = 6 mm were included in the study. twelve patients and a total of 77 sites completed the 5-year study. the results demonstrated clinical improvement of probing depth and gain of clinical attachment level of 3.4 mm and  1.2 mm, respectively. treatment to eliminate indicator bacteria continued for 3 years before the aim was fulfilled. in order to eliminate a. actinomycetemcomitans from a majority of the sites, a combination of surgery and  generalized tetracycline treatment was performed. a recolonization or regrowth of the indicator bacteria exceeding detection levels took place in several sites. the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia, alone or in combination, correlated with attachment level change on the individual level. no such correlation was obtained by using presence of plaque, bleeding on  probing, or three other bacteria (campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and  fusobacterium nucleatum) not used as treatment goal markers.

TI  == mixed infection with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in a murine lesion model: potential synergistic effects on virulence.
AB  == these studies determined the characteristics of tissue destruction in a murine abscess model elicited by mixed infection with the periodontopathogens fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. the interbacterial effects  of this synergism, the kinetics of the relationship of the bacterial interaction, and the characteristics of the bacteria required for the tissue destruction were  studied. infection of mice with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum strains elicited lesions of various sizes as a function of infective dose. primary infection with  f. nucleatum plus p. gingivalis at various ratios (i.e., <1:1) resulted in a significantly greater lesion size (p < 0.001) compared with that resulting from primary infection with p. gingivalis alone. at f. nucleatum/p. gingivalis ratios  of > or = 1:1, spreading lesion formation and progression were significantly (p < 0.001) decreased, suggesting that bacterial interaction (i.e., coaggregation) may have inhibited the spread of the p. gingivalis infection to a site distant from the initial injection. infection with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis simultaneously (at different sites) or f. nucleatum administered within 4 h prior to or 1 h following p. gingivalis infection significantly enhanced the ability of p. gingivalis to form large phlegmonous lesions. chemical inhibition of the p. gingivalis trypsin-like protease activity or the use of a trypsin-negative p. gingivalis strain abrogated tissue destruction either alone or in combination with f. nucleatum. therefore, it was possible to examine aspects of virulence of  these pathogens in a murine lesion model by either altering bacterial ratios, manipulating the time of infection, or targeting vital bacterial virulence factors.

TI  == inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.
AB  == funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata, strongly inhibited the adsorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) used as an experimental pellicle and strongly desorbed cariogenic mutans streptococci pre-adsorbed to s-ha. colonization inhibition and anticariogenic effects of funoran were also investigated in experimental rats. the colonization of streptococcus cricetus e49 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats administered funoran was less frequent than  that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group. the inhibitory effect of funoran on periodontopathic bacterial attachment was studied in vitro. funoran strongly inhibited the adsorption of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces species to s-ha and collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (co-ha) and apparently inhibited their attachment to the human gingival fibroblast gin-1 cell line. the present study indicates that funoran inhibits colonization by cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria and excludes them from human oral cavity.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == proteolytic artifacts in sds-page analysis of selected periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the aim of the study was to examine whether proteolytic artifacts, which result in a loss and poor resolution of protein bands, occur during sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of cellular proteins from selected proteolytic (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola) and non-proteolytic (fusobacterium nucleatum) bacteria. conditions to limit or prevent proteolysis were also investigated. bacterial cells were incubated in solubilizing buffer (sds+ beta mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for various periods of time before boiling. a control assay consisted of trichloroacetic acid-treated bacterial cells. cellular proteins were separated by electrophoresis and stained with coomassie blue. proteolysis occurred very rapidly in the case of p. gingivalis (< 30 s), whereas a longer incubation time (> 1 h) was required to observe similar effects in p. nigrescens and t. denticola. no proteolysis was observed for f. nucleatum. in all cases, heat (100  degrees c) and low ph (< 4) treatments of bacterial cells could avoid production  of proteolytic artifacts. incorporation of specific protease inhibitors before solubilization of bacteria could also prevent proteolysis. more particularly, n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck), iodoacetamide and diisopropylfluorophosphate (50 mm) were highly efficient for p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens and t. denticola, respectively. when outer membranes of p. gingivalis  were prepared in the presence of tlck, numerous additional protein brands, not seen in the absence of tlck, were detected. the present study suggests that specific protease inhibitors, effective in preventing proteolysis, should be identified and added during cell fractionation and protein purification procedures.

TI  == degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == response to periodontal therapy in patients with high or low levels of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and b. forsythus.
AB  == in a previous study, subjects receiving either adjunctive tetracycline or augmentin showed, on average, more attachment level gain 10 months post-therapy than subjects receiving either ibuprofen or a placebo, although some subjects in  each treatment group showed loss of attachment post-therapy. since differences in treatment response might have been due to differences in the subgingival microbiota, the response to different therapies in subjects with different pre-therapy subgingival microbiotas was evaluated. 29 subjects exhibiting loss of attachment > 2.5 mm at 1 or more sites during longitudinal monitoring were treated by modified widman flap surgery at deep sites, subgingival scaling at all other sites and were randomly assigned one of the following agents: augmentin, tetracycline, ibuprofen or a placebo. treatment was completed within 30 days, during which time the subject took the assigned agent. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of each tooth at each visit and evaluated for  their content of 14 subgingival species including p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia and b. forsythus using dna probes. 18 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 2 or more of these 4 species comprised the high test species group; 11 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 0 or 1 of the species, the low test species  group. because this was a post-hoc analysis, the number of subjects in some of the treatment/test species groups was small. however, the 8 high test species subjects who received tetracycline showed the most attachment level gain (0.83 +/- 0.20 mm), while the 3 tetracycline-treated, low test species subjects showed  minimal gain (0.05 +/- 0.28 mm) 10 months post-therapy. low test species subjects receiving augmentin (n = 2) showed a mean gain in attachment of 0.67 (+/- 0.59) mm. the mean % of sites showing either attachment gain or loss > or = 2 mm was computed for each treatment/test species group. high test species subjects receiving tetracycline exhibited the best ratio of gaining to losing sites (16.2), followed by low test species subjects receiving augmentin (14.1). periodontal pockets < 7 mm pre-therapy in low test species subjects treated with  augmentin and high test species subjects treated with tetracycline showed attachment gain more frequently than attachment loss. the greatest proportion of  gaining sites was seen at pockets > 6 mm, particularly in subjects receiving adjunctive tetracycline. overall, the data indicated that a gain in mean attachment level post-therapy was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with an increase in c. ochracea accompanied by a decrease in b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the 4 test species were decreased more in subjects receiving tetracycline. in contrast, augmentin appeared to be effective  in decreasing the % sites colonized by a. actinomycetemcomitans and in increasing the proportion of sites colonized by c. ochracea. knowledge of the baseline microbiota should improve the choice of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic for  periodontal therapy.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to determine by standard cultivation procedures  the detection frequencies of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and capnocytophaga species as well as various enteric rods in subgingival plaque samples form romanian adult periodontitis patients. dna probe  analysis (affirm dp microbial identification test) was also used, parallel to cultivation, to identify p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus, in deep (> or = 6 mm) and intermediate (4-5 mm) pockets in some of the subjects investigated. paper points were used to sample 86 deep pockets in 36 patients and 27 intermediate pockets in 9 of the 36 patients. the chi 2 test was  used to test for significance of differences between results obtained by cultivation and dna analysis in both intermediate and deep pockets. p. gingivalis was recovered in a high percentage of the patients (75.8%) and sites (63.6%) examined, followed by p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans,  respectively. capnocytophaga species were present in almost all subjects. enteric rods were recovered in 61.1% of the patients and 55.8% of the sites. except for this high prevalence of enteric rods, the present group of patients had the periodontal species monitored in %s similar to those commonly perceived in the west. the affirm dp test and cultivation showed poor correlation in detecting p.  gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus. the cultivation prevalence of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in deep pockets was similar to their prevalence in intermediate ones. overall, the prevalence of the periodontal pathogens investigated in the present romanian periodontitis patients is similar  to what has been revealed in matching norwegian and other western periodontitis patient populations. the high prevalence of enteric rods in the romanian patients may have been an artifact resulting from prolonged transport of the samples in vmga iii.

TI  == rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  == eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate  tests. identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting prevotella species, bacteroides forsythus, three capnocytophaga species, six actinomyces species, four propionibacterium species, and eight streptococcus species. two mannoside isomers differentiated actinomyces israelii and actinomyces gerencseriae. in addition to  porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus, and capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium alocis, actinomyces odontolyticus, actinomyces meyeri, and bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. the method was ideal for rapidly obtaining  presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as sds-page.

TI  == immune response to fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia in patients  with infectious mononucleosis.
AB  == the role of four oral flora organisms (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) was investigated in 22 patients with infectious mononucleosis. immunoglobulin-g class antibody titres to these organisms were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. serum levels in the patients were determined at day 1 and 42-56 days later. significantly higher antibody levels to f. nucleatum and pr. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients as compared to their first sample. the elevated antibody levels to f. nucleatum and pr. intermedia, known oral pathogens, suggest a potential pathogenic role for these organisms in  the pharyngo-tonsillitis associated with infectious mononucleosis.

TI  == a microbiological and clinical study of the safety and efficacy of baking-soda dentifrices.
AB  == this article reports the results of a study that examined the clinical and microbiological changes associated with regular use of baking-soda dentifrices. two dentifrice formulations were examined in a 6-month longitudinal study of 101  adult subjects with assessments for plaque, gingival inflammation, and stain at baseline and 3 and 6 months during the active phase of the study, and at 3 months after cessation of product use. one dentifrice contained 52% baking soda and 3% sodium percarbonate (arm & hammer peroxicare) while the other dentifrice contained 65% baking soda (arm & hammer dental care). both dentifrices resulted in statistically significant reductions in dental plaque, gingival inflammation,  and stain at all time periods compared to baseline. dental plaque and buccal soft-tissue samples were obtained for microbiological analysis from a 50-subject  subset. microbiological assays, including bacterial culture, phase-contrast microscopy, and immunofluorescence microscopy, confirmed the safety of both formulations. beneficial alterations in dental plaque bacteria were noted, including significant reductions in the levels of actinomyces species. the data from this study indicate that dentifrices containing high levels of baking soda are clinically effective and microbiologically safe.

TI  == viability of four putative periodontal pathogens and enteric rods in the anaerobic transport medium vmga iii.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the survival in vmga iii of porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods in laboratory cultures as well as in subgingival plaque samples. laboratory strains of the 4 putative periodontal pathogens and escherichia coli were used in the laboratory part of this study. also, 31 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 22 periodontal patients and stored in vmga iii. each sample, from both the laboratory and the clinical parts, was divided into 3 portions. one portion was cultured within a few hours of collection (baseline), while the second was processed after 24 h (day 2) and the third 48 h later (day 3). the results of the clinical part indicate that the  detection frequencies of all 4 periodontal pathogens and their levels in positive samples decreased, to different degrees, by day 2 and decreased further by day 3. enteric rods were not detected in base line samples. however, they were present in 16.1% and 22.6% of day 2 and day 3 samples, respectively. similarly, the laboratory results demonstrate a significant decrease in the levels of the 4 periodontal pathogens tested by day 2 and day 3, whereas the opposite occurred for e. coli. p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum survived better in the presence of e. coli than alone, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans survived less well when co-inoculated with e. coli. vmga iii appears to maintain microbial population ratios for periods up to 24 h. after 24 h, the multiplication of enteric organisms may alter the original proportions of the sample.

TI  == cell envelope and cell wall immunization of macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == [subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontic patients and susceptibility of these bacteria to minocycline-hcl].
AB  == the present study was carried out to examine the distribution of six periodontopathic bacteria in deep periodontal pockets and to reconfirm the effect of periocline on these periodontopathic bacteria. samples from sixty-two periodontal pockets were collected at pocket depths of over 4 mm in twenty-one periodontitis patients aged 43 to 75 years. after sampling, periocline was applied topically to the selected pockets once a week for four weeks and reexamined. the detected rates of the periodontopathic bacteria were capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%) and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution of  the bacteria was compound because two or three bacterial species were found to coexist. in view of the mic of minocycline-hci for these bacteria, increase of most of the measured bacteria was suppressed by the concentration of drugs, including periocline. however, clinical strains of p. i. were considered to have  low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. in view of the effect of topical application of drugs, no significant differences were found. from these results,  it was suggested that periocline contained effective concentration of minocycline-hcl.

TI  == competition for peptides and amino acids among periodontal bacteria.
AB  == we recently studied the utilization of glutathione (l-gamma-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine), l-cysteinylglycine and l-cysteine by anaerobic bacteria. the rate of hydrogen sulfide formation from these compounds was determined and it was concluded that peptostreptococcus micros and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum had an active transport of small peptides. in the present study it is shown that methyl mercaptan formation from l-methionine and l-methionyl-containing peptides can also be used to study peptide utilization. there were differences among the periodontal bacteria p. micros, f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis in their capacity to use l-cysteine and l-methionine and peptides containing these amino acids. the peptides were used more efficiently by p. micros and f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum than by p. gingivalis. all three species used the peptides more  efficiently than the free amino acids. the efficiency in utilizing various amino  acids and peptides may be among the key determinants of the periodontal microbial ecology.

TI  == endodontic pathogens: propagation of infection through patent dentinal tubules in traumatized monkey teeth.
AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in marginal periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be an aggravating factor in progression of marginal destruction. this has been associated with patency of  dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the purpose of the present investigation was to study to what extent a predefined selection of endodontic pathogens inoculated in the root canal can influence periodontal pathology and healing in areas of the root covered by or devoid of cementum, using root resorption as a histomorphometric marker. exposed dentine surfaces, in the present study showed significantly larger areas of resorption in infected roots compared to non-infected roots, while cementum surfaces showed an almost identical distribution of tissue reactions regardless of root canal infection or  not. it was concluded that endodontic pathogens or their products were not able to penetrate the cementum barrier. the significantly larger areas of resorption on exposed dentine surfaces in infected roots compared to non-infected roots indicated that endodontic pathogens or their products could spread through dentinal tubules to a root surface void of cementum. extrapolated to the marginal situation this indicated that endodontic pathogens in the root canal might be able to aggravate marginal infection in areas of root devoid of cementum.

TI  == comparative virulence of periodontopathogens in a mouse abscess model.
AB  == objective(s): this report compares the virulence of selected strains of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, f. nucleatum and t. denticola in a murine model as a measure of pathogenic potential of these oral microorganisms. the characteristics of the tissue destruction associated with these monoinfections were then related to a potential model for bacterial synergism in  progressing periodontitis. design and methods: all bacterial strains were grown to mid-logarithmic to early stationary growth phase, harvested and used at various doses to challenge balb/c normal and balb/c dexamethasone (dex) treated mice to mimic a neutrophil dysfunction. the characteristics of tissue destruction, and overt tissue destructive capacity of these species were examined as a function of challenge dose and time. outcome measures: the mice were examined for an interval of approximately 15 days post-challenge and the presence/absence of lesions, localized or generalized nature of the lesion (including size in mm2), and lethality of the infection were assessed. results: comparison of the virulence of the various p. gingivalis strains related to lethality and lesion size associated with destruction of the connective tissue, indicated a virulence capacity of p. gingivalis strains 53977>w50 = t22>3079>33277>381. c. rectus elicited localized necrotic lesions which were limited to the epithelial layers of the skin. the size of the lesions also indicated a graded difference in virulence, such that c. rectus strains 234>576>>33238. a. actinomycetemcomitans caused the formation of classic localized abscesses with a pmn infiltrate and inflammatory exudates. although each of the a. actinomycetemcomitans strains exhibited a similar virulence pattern in this murine model, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b representative  strains were potentially more pathogenic with a virulence capacity of 3113d-n = 3975a>jp2 > or = y4>29523>33384. both c. rectus and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains showed clear evidence that recent clinical isolates were more virulent than laboratory strains. challenge with f. nucleatum resulted in tissue destructive responses which were different from those observed with the other strains used in this study. a rapid onset of dose-dependent lesion development, related to the formation of either closed abscesses or open lesions, was observed with f. nucleatum. tissue involvement was also greater at lower f. nucleatum doses when compared to the other bacteria. f. nucleatum challenge of dex-treated  mice resulted in a shift to open lesions. t. denticola appeared to be more tissue invasive than the other species examined in this study. challenge of mice with t. denticola resulted in involvement of multiple tissues, including epithelial and connective tissues, as well as appearing to invade muscle layers and deeper tissues. in addition to invading deeper tissues, the resulting lesions took considerably longer to resolve. in the dex-treated mice (neutrophil depleted), p. gingivalis, c. rectus, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly more virulent. in contrast, while dex treatment altered the characteristics of lesions caused by f. nucleatum, the extent of lesions produced by f. nucleatum and t. denticola was not substantially enhanced. conclusions: the results obtained from  this study suggest that different microorganisms have the ability to provide individual pathologies which may act in an additive/synergistic fashion contributing to the tissue destruction noted in periodontitis.

TI  == cellular source, activation and inhibition of dental plaque collagenase.
AB  == dental plaque is the major aetiological factor in periodontal diseases and contains several proteolytic enzymes. the origin of these proteinases is, however, poorly studied. this study was undertaken to characterize collagenase present in dental plaque of adult periodontitis patients. vertebrate-type rather  than bacterial-derived collagenase activity was detected in extracts of both supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts of adult periodontitis patients. dental plaque collagenase was found to exist predominantly in autoactive form. dental plaque collagenase from periodontally healthy individuals existed in latent from. latent dental plaque collagenase from periodontitis lesions could be activated by a 95 kd chymotrypsin-like proteinase from treponema denticola and human leukocyte cathepsin g but not by human plasmin. incubation of purified latent leukocyte collagenase with whole cells of fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium saburreum, prevotella buccae and porphyromonas gingivalis, however, did not result to the activation of the enzyme. doxycycline in vitro inhibited dental plaque collagenase with an ic50-value of 20 microm. dental plaque collagenase degraded more efficiently type i and ii collagens than type iii collagen. western-blot analysis with specific anti-human neutrophil collagenase-antibody revealed that both in supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts dental plaque collagenase had undergone proteolytic conversion from an 80 kd proform to a 58 kd active form which is associated with catalytic autoactivity as measured by functional collagenase assay. this reflects proteolytic activation of leukocyte collagenase in dental plaque probably by other proteases derived from potent periodontopathogenic bacteria such as t. denticola or other pmn proteases such as cathepsin g.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == endodontic pathogens in periodontal disease augmentation.
AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be correlated to marginal periodontal breakdown. this has been associated with patency of dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the aim of the present investigation was to assess the effects of endodontic pathogens on marginal periodontal wound healing on root surfaces devoid of cementum but surrounded by healthy periodontal membrane. significant differences between infected and non-infected teeth were found with respect to pathological pocket and connective tissue: the experimental defects were covered by approximately 20% more pocket epithelium in infected teeth while defects in non-infected teeth showed approximately 10% more connective tissue coverage. it was concluded, that an intra-canal infection of endodontic pathogens stimulates epithelial downgrowth along denuded dentin surfaces with marginal communication. extrapolated to the clinical situation, endodontic infections in periodontitis-prone patients may augment periodontitis propagation.

AB  == earlier work has shown that gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) contains dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp) activities that resemble those in host tissue. here, further comparisons were made with enzymes from suspected periodontal pathogens. gingival tissue and gcf were collected from patients with chronic periodontitis. dpp ii and dpp iv fractions with acid and alkaline ph optima, respectively, were separated from crude tissue extracts by gel-filtration chromatography. bacterial  cell sonicates were prepared from broth cultures of reference strains. there was  moderate to strong dpp activity with capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp., very weak activity with treponema denticola and no detectable activity with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fusobacterium nucleatum. banding patterns in gcf, tissue and bacterial samples were compared on substrate-impregnated overlay membranes applied to isoelectric focusing gels. in  gels washed with acid buffer, gcf had bands corresponding to tissue dpp ii. use of an alkaline washing buffer showed gcf activity which closely matched tissue dpp iv that had been pretreated with neuraminidase, an enzyme found by others in  the gingival crevice. p. gingivalis gave multiple bands and several of these had  counterparts in gcf. the apparent presence in gcf of the dpp from p. gingivalis is consistent with the association of this organism with destructive periodontitis.

TI  == effect of whole oral bacteria and extracted lipopolysaccharides on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-2 receptor expression.
AB  == expression of the interleukin-2 receptor (il-2r) on t cells is the molecular mechanism that initiates the g0 to g1 transition and is the critical first step for t cell proliferation in response to antigen. the effect of whole periodontal  bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (lps) on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) il-2r expression was examined in vitro. lps induced a modest but significant increase in high affinity il-2r alpha/beta (p55/p75 positive) expression on pbmc over untreated cells after 48 h culture. addition of lps to pbmc cultures depleted of monocytes had no effect on il-2r expression compared to untreated cultures. interleukin-1 (il-1) caused a similar effect to lps in 48 h pbmc cultures but il-1 also increased high affinity il-2r expression in cultures  depleted of adherent mononuclear cells. when antibody to il-1 was simultaneously  added with lps to pbmc cultures, the high affinity il-2r inductive effect was reversed at 48 h, suggesting that the lps effect on pbmc il-2r was indirect, via  monocytes. whole pathogenic oral bacteria cultured with pbmc at high (100:1), but not low (10:1) bacteria:pbmc ratios had a similar effect to lps, inducing high affinity il-2r expression at 48 h. increases in soluble il-2r alpha were also measured in supernatants of pbmc incubated with periodontal bacteria compared to  untreated controls. in this system, a critical threshold of bacteria was required to activate pbmc perhaps related to the quantity of cell-surface lps presented to adherent mononuclear cells.

TI  == volatile fatty acids, metabolic by-products of periodontopathic bacteria, inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production.
AB  == short-chain fatty acids are a major by-product of anaerobic metabolism and can be detected in gingival fluid from periodontal pockets. since most t cells are present subjacent to the pocket epithelium in conjunction with the plasma cells,  it is important to know how these t cells are affected by short-chain fatty acids produced by subgingival plaque. the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of extracellular metabolites from periodontopathic bacteria on the proliferation and cytokine production of mouse splenic cells as a potential mechanism of imbalance among host-microbial interactions. a low-molecular-weight, heat-stable agent present in the two-day culture filtrate of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, and fusobacterium nucleatum significantly depressed con a- and lps- induced cell proliferation. to determine whether short-chain fatty acids present in the filtrate could account for the depression, we tested extracted volatile and non-volatile fatty acids for their effects on mitogenic activity. the volatile fatty acids extracted from immunosuppressive supernatants greatly inhibited t- and b- cell proliferation. among these volatile fatty acids, butyric, propionic, valeric, and isovaleric acids impaired cell proliferation dose-dependently. from gas-liquid chromatographic analysis data, it is suggested that immuno-inhibitory activities in culture filtrates are mainly attributable to butyric and isovaleric acids in p. gingivalis, to propionic, butyric, and isovaleric acids in p. loescheii, and to butyric acid in f. nucleatum. furthermore, these fatty acids significantly depressed interleukin 2 (il-2), il-4, il-5, il-6, and il-10 production by con a-stimulated splenic-t cells dose-dependently.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == some suspected periodontopathogens and serum antibody response in adult long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics.
AB  == the subgingival microflora and serum antibody response were examined in long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics and age- and sex-matched non-diabetics. the material consisted of 9 diabetics aged 40-49 years and 19 aged 50-59 years, 13 non-diabetics aged 40-49 years and 21 aged 50-59 years. the bacterial species  studied (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia) were recovered in diabetics as well as in non-diabetics. significantly more diabetics in both age groups harboured p. gingivalis compared to non-diabetics. prevalence of p. gingivalis was associated  with deepened periodontal pockets among non-diabetics but not among diabetics. in diabetics and non-diabetics, the serum antibody titres for most antigens were similar.

TI  == cellular adhesion molecules on periodontal lymphocytes.
AB  == t cell induced differentiation of b cells has been shown to be dependent on the cd2/lfa-3 and lfa-1/icam-1 pathways. flow cytometric analysis was used to examine these adhesion molecules on t and b cells extracted from gingival tissues before  and after stimulation with the putative periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas  gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. adhesion molecule expression on peripheral blood cells from healthy adults was used as a control. approximately 50 per cent of b cells extracted from gingival tissues expressed lfa-3 and icam-1 compared with 30 per cent positive peripheral blood b cells. around 50 per cent of gingival t cells expressed cd2 relative to 76 per cent positive peripheral blood t cells. however, 40-50 per cent of both gingival and peripheral blood t cells expressed lfa-1. there was no difference in the expression of adhesion molecules on t and b cells extracted from health/marginal gingivitis or adult periodontitis lesions. after stimulation of gingival cells in vitro, the per cent cd2 positive t cells and lfa-3 and icam-1 positive b cells remained relatively stable over the six-day culture period, although p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum appeared to induce an increase in the percentage of gingival t cells expressing lfa-1. in contrast to the gingival lymphocytes, stimulation of peripheral blood cells resulted in an increase in the per cent cd2 positive t cells, lfa-3 and icam-1 positive b cells, with a decrease in lfa-1 positive t cells. the results therefore demonstrated that gingival t and b cells express adhesion molecules in  vivo.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
AB  == human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (lps). the effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the dna content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. lps samples were purified from porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and escherichia coli 0111:b4 lps was used as a positive control. at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the lpss caused any change in the production of dna or protein, whereas the amount of dna was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. protein synthesis was decreased by lpss at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of lps tested.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.
AB  == periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (jp), rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp), and adult periodontitis (ap), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. these disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. the present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of pbmc of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. the ap group had a significantly lower production of il-1ra when stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) (p < 0.05). streptococcus sanguis (s.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of il-1 alpha and tnf alpha production in all groups. the rpp group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (mc) than the ap group (p < 0.05). additionally, jp patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (p < 0.05). in conclusion, il-1 alpha, tnf alpha, or il-6 production by peripheral blood mc after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. the results support the hypothesis that the cytokine il-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: rpp and ap. furthermore, elevated mc concentration in the rpp group compared to the ap group may be an important pathogenic feature in rpp.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of periodontopathic bacteria associated with failing implants.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the subgingival microflora associated with failing implants, and to determine their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics in periodontal therapy and dental practice. thirteen partially edentulous patients with 19 failing implants were selected. clinical examination  included probing depth, attachment level, gingival index, plaque index, and radiographic analyses. two subgingival plaque samples were taken from each failing implant and analyzed for microbial composition. fusobacterium nucleatum,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia were the prevalent cultivable microflora. antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was determined by the agar dilution technique. antibacterial activity of penicillin g, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and the combination amoxicillin-metronidazole was significantly higher than with other antibiotics tested. these data indicated that the commonly-used antibiotics were highly effective against bacteria isolated around failing implants, which would suggest the use of these antibiotics to control peri-implant infections.

TI  == biological activities of lipopolysaccharides from oral bacteria and their relevance to the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss in adults and is a consequence of the colonisation of the subgingival region by organisms such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a constituent of the cell walls of all of these bacteria and is found in large quantities on the surfaces of periodontally-diseased teeth. lps from oral bacteria has a marked effect on most  types of cell found in the periodontal tissues including macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and osteoblasts. fibroblasts and macrophages respond to  oral lps by secreting a range of cytokines, and other effector molecules, with inflammatory, immunomodulatory and tissue-destroying capabilities. lymphocytes are stimulated by lps to produce a wide range of antibodies with different specificities, hence exacerbating the inflammatory response. by its actions on bone cells, lps can stimulate bone resorption and inhibit bone formation resulting in erosion of the tooth-supporting alveolar bone. there is, therefore,  considerable evidence implicating lps in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis. however, the possible involvement of other biologically-active bacterial components must not be overlooked.

TI  == microbial associations of 4 putative periodontal pathogens in sudanese adult periodontitis patients determined by dna probe analysis.
AB  == the few previous cultivation studies on the in vivo associations between various  periodontal microbial species have shown several positive and negative associations. the present investigation utilized dna probe analysis to examine possible in vivo associations between the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides forsythus in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 sudanese untreated adult periodontitis patients. the standard paper point technique was used to sample 99  sites with a mean probing depth of 6.8 mm (range 6.0 to 10.0). microbial associations were determined by detecting the effect of the presence or absence of one species (effector) on the occurrence of the other 3 species (target). the  wilcoxon signed rank test was used to examine variations in occurrence of each target bacteria in the presence or absence of the effector. in addition, the spearman's rank correlation test was used to assess the relationship between the  level of each bacteria to that of the other 3. results showed bacterial associations with the following effector-on-target effects: f. nucleatum (p < 0.01 wilcoxon; p < 0.001 spearman) >> p. gingivalis (p < 0.01 wilcoxon; p < 0.001 spearman), and b. forsythus (p < 0.05 wilcoxon; p < 0.001 spearman) > p. intermedia (p < 0.01 spearman). the study demonstrated positive associations between the 4 species investigated, while no neutral or negative associations were revealed. the most striking finding was the effect exerted by f. nucleatum on the colonization of p. intermedia; p. intermedia was never detected in a site  unless f. nucleatum was also present.

TI  == effect of treatment on some periodontopathogens and their antibody levels in periodontal abscesses.
AB  == twenty patients suffering from abscess of periodontal origin were treated and followed clinically and microbiologically for 6 months. microbiological examination was performed by culture technique. one deep and one shallow periodontal pocket in the same patient were examined concomitantly. serum was collected and analyzed for specific antibody level using elisa methodology. treatment included supragingival scaling, drainage, and irrigation of the periodontal pocket with 0.85% sodium chloride and systemic tetracycline administration, 1 g per day for 2 weeks. at baseline, 90% of the abscesses harbored porphyromonas gingivalis and/or prevotella intermedia. after 6 months, abscess sites demonstrated a reduced probing depth, less bleeding on probing, and gain of attachment. abscess sites showed no p. gingivalis and the proportion of p. intermedia was significantly reduced 6 months after treatment. in deep periodontal pockets a similar pattern was seen. shallow pockets demonstrated few  clinical signs of inflammation and the number of bacteria was generally low. campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp, and fusobacterium nucleatum were frequently seen in low numbers in most sites during the study period, while actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was detected only in a few sites. the igg levels in patient sera against antigens of homologous bacterial strains remained  fairly constant for 6 months. the result of the present study indicates that p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are involved in periodontal abscess formation. also, treatment where drainage is combined with tetracycline administration promotes healing and reattachment.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

TI  == bacteriological diagnosis of periodontal disease.
AB  == dental plaque bacteria cause virtually all the forms of inflammatory periodontal  disease. periodontitis is caused by the specific periodontopathic bacteria, which induce destruction of connective tissue attachment and adjacent alveolar bone. examinations to identify the infections by porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and treponema denticola have recently become essential in diagnosis of periodontal disease. bacterial examination permits (1) identification of the causative bacteria, (2) assessment of disease activity and (3) monitoring of the effective  of periodontal treatments. the author describes details of accurate and rapid methods for detecting periodontopathogens. transmission of periodontopathic bacteria as clarified by bacterial examination is also discussed in this review.  the pathogenic potential of specific bacteria varies among patients and periodontally healthy individuals and can be controlled by host defense mechanisms such as immune responses. the roles of immune responses against periodontopathic bacteria in balance shifts of periodontal disease processes are  therefore also discussed in this review.

AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

AB  == the purposes of this study were two-fold: to compare the dna probe and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) microbial identification tests and correlate the levels of microorganisms with adult periodontitis. a single plaque sample were taken from each of 2 sites in 52 patients. twelve of these patients were also sampled during and after treatment. the experimental site had clinical indicators of disease (bleeding on probing, probing and attachment loss of > or = 6 mm) and the contralateral site (control) was clinically healthy. a total of 176 plaque samples were collected, divided, processed, and sent for both types of quantitative microbial analyses. all of these samples were used to compare the dna probe and elisa methods while only the initial 104 pretreatment sites were used to correlate microorganisms/method with clinical indicators of adult periodontitis. dna probes were used to assay for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, and c. rectus. an elisa utilizing monoclonal antibodies was used to assay for p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, t. denticola, and c. rectus. comparison of the two methods revealed that the elisa test identified p. gingivalis and c. rectus significantly more often than the dna probe method and that t. denticola was detected more frequently with the dna probe. the sensitivities and specificities  varied widely among organisms and by test. p. gingivalis, as identified by elisa, had the highest degree of sensitivity and specificity (0.90 and 0.82 respectively) to clinical indicators of adult periodontitis.

TI  == identification and analyses of periodontal pathogens in taiwan by microbiological tests.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to use microbiological tests for diagnosis of periodontal diseases in taiwan. anaerobic culture, direct microscopy, indirect immunofluorescence (if), and biochemical tests were used to examine 336 samples for the specific microorganisms in subgingival plaque. the results indicated that gram-negative species and motile bacteria were less frequently detected, and in lower proportion, in samples from healthy sites. the bacteria found frequently in healthy group were the coccal forms. however, bacteroides forsythus detected by if showed a close association with periodontal inflammation. porphyromonas gingivalis was found with about 53% frequency in the periodontitis group; in more than half the samples the proportion was above 5%. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was recovered with 48% frequency of periodontitis group. other cultivable species including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species,  centipeda periodontii, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas species, and the spirochetes were detected in a significantly higher proportion in periodontitis group. the results strongly support the use of microbiological tests as adjuncts to diagnosis, and for assessment of the importance of microbiota in periodontal disease.

TI  == polyclonal b cell activation, endotoxin tolerance, and limulus tests of endotoxin preparations of some periodontopathogens.
AB  == potencies of polyclonal b-cell activation in c3h/hen mice of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis endotoxins were 0.36, 0.13 and 0.04, taking salmonella abortusequi as 1.0. f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis endotoxins showed positive reactions in c3h/hej mice. most activities in c3h/hen other than that of f. nucleatum were suppressed by polymyxin b. in c3h/hej mice, similar inhibitions were only 60% for p. gingivalis and hardly observed with f. nucleatum. the resistances to polymyxin b could be due to protein in the endotoxins. a promoting effect of t cells added to b cells  was observed only in the activity of f. nucleatum endotoxin in c3h/hej mice; there was no influence in other groups. test endotoxins had nearly the same ability to produce colony stimulating factor as did references and could not produce the factor in tolerant mice. the clinical significance of tolerance is discussed. regression lines of endotoxin doses and limulus activities of test endotoxins and salmonella were parallel, either in specific or non-specific tests. the lines of two test groups were also parallel; values obtained by two tests were very close. these data indicate that the test endotoxins did not contain (1-3)-beta-d-glucan and elicited qualitatively similar limulus reactions  to that of the reference, despite their different chemical natures. in conclusion, these test preparations had an endotoxicity similar to that of the reference and contribute to produce periodontitis through polyclonal b cell activation.

TI  == impaired bactericidal activity of pmn from two brothers with necrotizing ulcerative gingivo-periodontitis.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of necrotizing ulcerative gingivo-periodontitis (anup) diagnosed in two brothers, age 9 (anup1)  and 14 (anup2) from rural egypt. complete blood count, differential and blood chemistry were within normal limits for both brothers and they were not malnourished. the phagocytosis and killing function of their polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) towards four bacterial species were assessed using a fluorochrome microassay. the selection of bacterial species was based on preliminary microbiological results in early onset periodontitis in egypt. fluorochrome-labeled prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were pre-opsonized with anup serum and added to pmn from both anup patients, as well as pmn from three sex-matched and two sex- and age-matched healthy egyptian control (ctl) subjects. we found significant depressions (p < 0.05) in pmn phagocytosis and killing of c. rectus and p. intermedia by anup1 and anup2, when compared to all ctl pmn. an assessment of the gram-negative subgingival microflora present in both anup patients (in colony forming unit percent of total cfu recovered) (cfu %) revealed the presence of p. intermedia (anup1, 41.7 cfu %; anup2, 14.8 cfu %), fusobacterium nucleatum (anup1, 3.6 cfu %; anup2, 48.1 cfu %), and veillonella spp. (anup1, 18.2 cfu %; anup2, 18.5 cfu %). spirochetes were also observed in cytocentrifuged, gram-stained plaque from both anup patients. the predominant gram-positive bacterial species recovered from both nug1 and nug2 was streptococcus morbillorum.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) by flow cytometry (fcm) using a monoclonal antibody (mab) omr-bg1e directed to p. gingivalis-specific lipopolysaccharide (lps). the p. gingivalis strains atcc 33277, 381, eso75, w50, and a7a1 were selected for the study. fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum), prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia), campylobacter rectus (c. rectus), streptococcus sanguis (s. sanguis) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) served as controls. a suspension of 10(7) bacteria/ml of each bacteria was prepared and then reacted with a p. gingivalis specific mab omr-bg1e and fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc) labeled second antibody. these samples were analyzed by fcm. bacterial specific binding aggregate on data was separated out by the forward- and side-angle-scatter characteristics, while non-specific binding (nsb) was eliminated by excluding the region with mouse igg-positive and second antibody-positive area. fcm detected a mean range of 56.2% to 97.2% p. gingivalis strains. there was a 5.1% non-specific binding using fcm to non-p. gingivalis strains. when the p. gingivalis concentration was adjusted to 10(2), 10(4), and 10(6) bacteria/ml, a detection rate of 35.7%, 48.1%, and 91.4%, was respectively  observed. the lower sensitivity of the flow cytometric assay was 10(2) bacteria/ml. when p. gingivalis was added to p. intermedia suspension at 1, 20, 40, 60, and 80%, the mab-positive fraction yielded by fcm displayed a coefficient of determination of 0.967 with the actual percentage of p. gingivalis and could be regressed to a linear function.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == macaca fascicularis as a model in which to assess the safety and efficacy of a vaccine for periodontitis.
AB  == we have assessed macaca fascicularis as a potential model in which to test the efficacy and safety of a vaccine for periodontitis. twenty-eight animals were surveyed and 20 studied in more detail. clinical periodontal status was assessed, the subgingival microflora analyzed especially for the presence and proportions of porphyromonas gingivalis and titers and avidities of serum antibodies reactive with p. gingivalis measured. probing depths ranged from 0.90 mm to 3.80 mm, gingival index scores from 0.00 to 4.00 and plaque index scores from 0.00 to 3.00. about 40% of sites bled on probing. the animals manifested a subgingival flora characteristic of the anaerobic gram-negative bacteria found in human periodontal pockets, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. p. gingivalis was detected in 70 of 80 samples studied, ranging from 0.01% to 20% of the total flora. serum antibody reactive with antigens of p. gingivalis was observed in all animals, with titers ranging from 1.0 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) unit to 25 elisa units and avidities from 0.10 m to 2.20 m. antibody titer and maximum percentage of p. gingivalis were inversely correlated, indicating that a humoral immune response may be effective in reducing p. gingivalis overgrowth. m. fascicularis appears to be an excellent model for use in vaccine development.

TI  == adherence of oral microorganisms to guided tissue membranes: an in vitro study.
AB  == microorganisms can adhere and colonize on an exposed guided tissue regeneration (gtr) membrane thus developing a nidus of infection. the purpose of this study was to compare early bacterial adhesion to three different gtr membranes. expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, polyglactin 910, and collagen were used as the  test membranes. in part i of this study 15 different oral microbes were used to compare their relative ability to adhere to the membranes. six of the most strongly adherent bacteria (actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas sputigena) were selected for part ii of  this study. the membranes were placed in tubes containing broth cultures containing identical concentrations (1 x 10(8) cells/ml) of these bacteria at 37  degrees c. membranes were placed in tubes of media without bacteria as controls.  at 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, the bacterial cultures were decanted and the membranes in the tubes were agitated gently in reduced transfer fluid (rtf) 4 times to remove non-adherent bacteria. each tube was then sonicated for 30 seconds in 10 ml rtf to detach adherent bacteria. the detached adherent bacteria were counted using a petroff-hausser chamber. data were analyzed by using the sas program. analysis of variance was used to test for differences between multiple means. results showed s. mutans had the strongest attachment to the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours. selenomonas sputigena had the lowest adherence capability to all test membranes. polyglactin 910 had significantly (p < 0.05) lower s. mutants adherence than either the eptfe or the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relationship between salivary blood group antigens, microbial flora and periodontal condition in young adults.
AB  == to investigate a possible role for salivary blood-group antigens in the relative  frequencies of selected periodontal pathogens and commensal oral micro-organisms, we studied the clinical and microbiological condition in young adults with or without blood group reactive substances in saliva (secretors or non-secretors respectively). clinical measurements were recorded at the ramfjord teeth in 81 1st-year dental students. in addition, presence of interproximal loss of attachment (la) was assessed at sites with a pocket depth of > or = 4 mm. microbiological samples were taken from one of the ramfjord teeth (site without interproximal la), from interproximal sites of > or = 4 mm in conjunction with la, and from the saliva. the samples were analyzed for the presence of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. clinically, no statistically significant differences were found in the periodontal status between secretors (78% of our population) and non-secretors. furthermore, the occurrence of the monitored micro-organisms was not correlated to the secretor status. it is concluded that bacterial colonization with the micro-organisms tested in this study, apparently occurred independent of secretor status. among the periodontal  pathogens, only p. intermedia was more frequently recovered from the saliva of subjects with interproximal la (49%) than in those without (33%; p = 0.03). this  finding was irrespective of the secretor status. therefore, p. intermedia may be  an important micro-organism in relation to the onset of periodontal destruction in young adults.

TI  == demonstration of human immunoglobulin g fc-binding activity in oral bacteria.
AB  == nonimmune binding of immunoglobulins via the fc fragment may reduce opsonization  and phagocytosis of bacteria and is thus considered a virulence factor. the aim of this study was to investigate a wide range of oral bacterial strains for the presence of human immunoglobulin g (igg) fc-binding activity. a total of 132 strains representing 40 different gram-positive and gram negative bacterial species were tested for igg fc-binding activity by using a fast and simple dot blot procedure with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated fc fragments from human igg. neither the human nor animal biotype of porphyromonas gingivalis possessed igg fc-binding activity. the strongest positive reaction of gram-negative species with the igg fc fragments were obtained with strains of prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. among the gram-positive bacteria tested, peptostreptococcus micros, lactobacillus spp., and several species of streptococci possessed igg fc-binding activity. in the present investigation, the ability of several oral bacterial species to bind igg fc fragments was demonstrated. this factor represents a potential virulence determinant as it may  help pathogenic oral bacteria escape host defense mechanisms.

TI  == modeling the relationship between clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters and alveolar bone levels in an elderly population.
AB  == a cross-sectional periodontal study of 74 subjects aged 65 to 75 years was performed. clinical data were collected and related to microbiological and immunological data. a statistical model (step-wise multiple regression) of factors related to bone loss was created initially using clinical data only; then by adding either the microbiologic or immunologic data; and then by using clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic data together. when only clinical data were considered, three factors were found to have significant positive correlations with bone loss. tooth mobility accounted for 17% of the variability  in the alveolar bone level measurements, probing depth for 12%(r2), and plaque index for 3%, for a total of 32% of the variability explained by these clinical factors. tooth mobility and probing depth were clinical factors which remained significant in the model when the microbiological data were also considered. as percentages of the total cultivable microbiota, e. corrodens (r2 = 14%) and black-pigmenting prevotella intermedia (r2 = 4%) correlated positively with alveolar bone loss. the addition of the microbiologic data only increased the r2  to 33%. when immunological data were considered with the clinical data, pocket depth and tooth mobility were the clinical parameters which remained in the model. igg antibody levels to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 24%) a. actinomycetemcomitans 627 (r2 = 2%) were the significant immunologic measures having a positive correlation with bone loss. anti-f. nucleatum levels had a significant negative correlation. a total of 50% of the variability in alveolar bone level was accounted for in the model by the addition of specific serum antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms. when clinical, microbiological, and immunological measurements were all considered together, antibody to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 42%), percentage of b-lymphocytes  (r2 = 3%), probing depth (r2 = 4%), anti-e. corrodens levels (r2 = 2%), and anti-p. gingivalis 33277 levels (r2 = 4%) all had significant positive correlation with loss of alveolar bone. the number of enteric bacteria, anti-f. nucleatum levels, and anti-p. intermedia levels each had a significant negative correlation with alveolar bone heights. the r2 for this model was 75%. these results indicated that antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms and tooth mobility were the best predictors of bone loss in the elderly patients tested in this study.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. the elimination of p. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on p. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. we have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of p. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. in this study we determined the proportions of p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga spp, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using n-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (bapna) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. p. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (p values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of p. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. the amidolytic activity of treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). the  outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of p. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.

AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == an in vivo study of the influence of the surface roughness of implants on the microbiology of supra- and subgingival plaque.
AB  == in nine patients with fixed prostheses supported by endosseous titanium implants, 2 titanium abutments (transmucosal part of the implant) were replaced by either an unused standard abutment or a roughened titanium abutment. after 3 months of habitual oral hygiene, plaque samples were taken for differential phase-contrast  microscopy, dna probe analysis, and culturing. supragingivally, rough abutments harbored significantly fewer coccoid micro-organisms (64 vs. 81%), which is indicative of a more mature plaque. subgingivally, the observations depended on the sampling procedure. for plaque collected with paper points, only minor qualitative and quantitative differences between both substrata could be registered. however, when the microbiota adhering to the abutment were considered, rough surfaces harbored 25 times more bacteria, with a slightly lower density of coccoid organisms. the presence and density of periodontal pathogens subgingivally were, however, more related to the patient's dental status than to  the surface characteristics of the abutments. these results justify the search for optimal surface smoothness for all intra-oral and intra-sulcular hard surfaces for reduction of bacterial colonization and of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == role of suspected periodontopathogens in microbiological monitoring of periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal disease is the clinical result of a complex interaction between the host and plaque bacteria. although a specificity to some degree is found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), it has been difficult to obtain evidence for a specific etiological role of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease in adults. what we see is the net result of host-parasite interactions which in an unpredictable moment accumulate  and exceed the threshold of tissue integrity. this hypothesis is concomitant with the view of periodontal disease as a polymicrobial infection, predominantly anaerobic, which occurs commonly in the oral cavity or elsewhere in the body. some micro-organisms (risk markers) occur more frequently than others and may significantly determine the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. microbiological sampling and analysis seem to be of limited value in risk assessment; however, they can be used as tools in diagnosis in ljp patients and acute infections, and in treatment decision and therapy control in "refractory" patients. suspected pathogens (risk markers) are actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and some species of spirochetes, while the roles of prevotella intermedia, bacteroidesforsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and peptostreptococcus micros are more uncertain. the presence of periodontopathogens as well as enterics, staphylococcus aureus and candida especially, should be considered in patients with systemic individual disorders--e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and aids--or with implants.

AB  == the non-human primate macaca nemestrina was evaluated for use as a potential model in periodontal research by study of 16 animals. using one incisor, premolar, and molar per quadrant, we measured supragingival plaque, severity of gingival inflammation, and pocket depth, and analyzed the subgingival flora. serum igg titers and avidities to antigens of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were also assessed. ten animals were between 13 and 24 years old, and six were between 4 and 5 years old. while mean gingival inflammation scores were significantly higher for older than for younger animals (2.2 vs 1.8, p < 0.05), mean plaque index scores and mean probing depths  did not differ significantly. the animals harbored a subgingival microflora considered to be pathogenic for humans including aa, pg, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia i and ii, campylobacter recta and fusobacterium nucleatum.  aa, however, was found only in the younger animals. all of the animals had serum  igg antibodies reactive with antigens of pg and aa, and titers for pg but not for aa were significantly higher in the older relative to the younger animals (t test p < 0.02). in contrast, antibody avidity did not significantly differ between the two groups. a combined clinical assessment index based on maximum probing depth,  gingival index score, and tooth loss was used to assess the overall disease severity. titers were positively associated with disease severity (spearman's rank correlation 0.57, p = 0.02).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == measurement of electrical bioimpedance for studying utilization of amino acids and peptides by porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema  denticola.
AB  == the growth response of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola to peptides (supplied as trypticase) and amino acids (supplied as casamino acids) was measured over 24 hours by monitoring changes in  alternating-current conductivity at 37 degrees c. all species utilized peptides preferentially over amino acids. these results are consistent with those obtained previously with conventional growth-response experiments. the duration of the linear growth response to trypticase of p. gingivalis was 9.7 hours, whereas that of both f. nucleatum and t. denticola was > 24 hours. by contrast, there was more uniformity in the utilization of amino acids from the casamino acid mixture, which previously has been shown to be a poor growth substrate. furthermore, subtle differences in growth patterns, such as the ability of f. nucleatum to metabolize its storage glycopolymers before utilizing amino acids, were clearly evident. the present method provides an excellent means of studying bacterial growth kinetics and delineating bacterial/substrate specificities of both synthetic and natural substrates.

TI  == tetracycline resistance in periodontal pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial agents are used in combination with debridement to eliminate putative periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, from diseased tissues. the  most frequently used antimicrobial agents are the tetracyclines. however, these agents are not effective in some patients. this lack of efficacy may be due to antimicrobial resistance. as many as 75% of the bacteria in the subgingival flora may be resistant to tetracycline after long-term, low-dose treatment. tetracycline resistance is mediated by the tet(m) determinant in some isolates of veillonella species and fusobacterium nucleatum, while a dna probe to the tet(q)  determinant hybridizes to isolates of prevotella denticola and p. intermedia. the mechanism of tetracycline resistance for most periodontal organisms, however, has yet to be determined. before tetracycline is used as adjunctive therapy for refractory periodontitis, the subgingival bacterial flora should be tested for susceptibility.

TI  == oral and dental infections with anaerobic bacteria: clinical features, predominant pathogens, and treatment.
AB  == microbial populations colonizing the teeth are a major source of pathogens responsible for oral and dental infections, including periodontal diseases, gingivitis, pericoronitis, endodontitis, peri-implantitis, and postextraction infections. each entity has distinct clinical and microbial features. bacterial species associated with oral infections include actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium species, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and peptostreptococcus micros. treponema pallidum-related spirochetes have been associated with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. porphyromonas endodontalis appears to be specifically related to endodontic infections. oral infections in medically compromised patients, including those with aids, are associated with similar species and are  usually complicated by superinfection with enteric and candida species. isolation of species causing oral infections requires the collection of appropriate samples and the use of strictly anaerobic techniques. rapid selective culture, immunofluorescence, and dna probe methods have been developed for the identification of these oral species. the varied measures required in the management of oral and dental infections may include antimicrobial therapy. accurate microbiological diagnosis, including antibiotic susceptibility testing,  is indicated for cases that do not respond to therapy.

TI  == new findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  == the predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'streptococcus milleri'-group, bacteroides ureolyticus, capnocytophaga ochracea, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, p. intermedia, p. oralis and unidentified prevotella  spp. two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. the large proportion of non-pigmented prevotella species, p. asaccharolytica and b. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. the role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.

TI  == sensitization of periodontopathogenic bacteria to killing by light from a low-power laser.
AB  == cultures of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans were treated with a range of photosensitizers and then exposed to light from a 7.3 mw helium/neon laser for up to 80 s. toluidine blue o (25 micrograms/ml) and methylene blue (25 micrograms/ml) were effective lethal photosensitizers of all 3 target organisms, enabling substantial light dose-related reductions in viable counts. dihaematoporphyrin ester and aluminium  disulphonated phthalocyanine were lethal photosensitizers only of p. gingivalis.  in the absence of a photosensitizer, exposure to laser light had no significant effect on the viability of the cultures. if such low doses of light (22 j/cm2) are effective at killing bacteria in vivo, the technique may be useful as a means of eliminating periodontopathogenic bacteria from diseased sites.

TI  == serum immunoglobulin g antibodies to porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguis during experimental gingivitis in young adults.
AB  == twenty-eight young, healthy adults completed an experimental gingivitis study in  which blood and clinical recordings were obtained at baseline; after a 4-week period of thorough oral hygiene; after a subsequent 3-week period of plaque accumulation; and after another 2 weeks of thorough oral hygiene. serum immunoglobulin g antibodies against whole cells of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguis were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. mean serum immunoglobulin g antibody levels to p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and s. sanguis remained essentially constant during the experiment, whereas the immunoglobulin g antibodies to p. gingivalis declined during the initial period of oral hygiene and the subsequent period of plaque accumulation to an average of 84.5% of the baseline value. this reduction could be attributed to the people who developed marked gingival inflammation during the period of plaque accumulation, indicating that the systemic host response may be associated with local tissue responses to  variations in oral hygiene. these people were, however, also characterized by higher initial serum immunoglobulin g responses to p. gingivalis than people who  developed less pronounced gingival inflammation during the experiment. the variability and individuality noted in the host response to potential pathogens have important implications for attempts to use such measures for establishing a  diagnosis or prognosis for the individual patient.

AB  == the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037  against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia  decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.

TI  == enzyme activity in crevicular fluid in relation to metabolic control of diabetes  and other periodontal risk factors.
AB  == diabetics are generally considered at higher risk for periodontitis than non-diabetics. among diabetics, those with poorer metabolic control have often been found to have more periodontitis. this study investigated the relationship between two crevicular fluid enzymes, beta-glucuronidase (beta g) and lactic dehydrogenase (ldh), and metabolic control in 93 adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes. metabolic control was evaluated by glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c) levels. the most visibly inflamed site was sampled for crevicular fluid enzymes and plaque for microbial assessment. plaque, calculus, and probing depth were also recorded. beta-glucuronidase was found at significantly higher levels in patients with poorer diabetic control while ldh levels were not related to control. using multiple regression analysis, good metabolic control was the only  predicting variable for beta-glucuronidase when considered with microbes, probing depth, plaque, calculus, age, duration, and type of diabetes. if beta-glucuronidase is a predictor of periodontal disease activity, diabetics with poor metabolic control are at higher risk for periodontitis.

TI  == lethal photosensitization of bacteria in subgingival plaque from patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples from patients with chronic periodontitis were exposed  to light from a 7.3 mw helium/neon laser for 30 s in the presence and absence of  50 micrograms/ml toluidine blue o as a photosensitizer. viable counts of various  groups and species of bacteria were carried out before and after irradiation. the median numbers of viable bacteria initially present in the 30-microliters aliquots irradiated were 1.13 x 10(5) cfu (aerobes), 4.08 x 10(5) cfu (anaerobes), 4.92 x 10(3) cfu (black-pigmented anaerobes), 4.75 x 10(2) cfu (porphyromonas gingivalis), 6.15 x 10(3) cfu (fusobacterium nucleatum) and 1.7 x  10(4) cfu (streptococci). the dye/laser combination achieved significant reductions in the viability of these organisms, the median reductions in the viable counts being 91.1% for aerobes, 96.6% for anaerobes, 100% for black-pigmented anaerobes, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum and 94.2% for streptococci. overall, the viability of bacteria in the 20 plaque samples was not significantly decreased by the dye alone. however, in a small minority of samples there were indications of light-independent, dye-induced toxicity. low-power lasers, in conjunction with appropriate photosensitizers, may be a useful adjunct to mechanical debridement in the treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases if a similar effectiveness against subgingival plaque bacteria can be achieved in vivo.

TI  == aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  == phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium omiz-w1. none of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, selenomonas sputigena, treponema pectinovorum, t. socranskii, or wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine  methylester). phenylalanine was essential for the growth of capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium timidum, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. with the exception of e. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow  when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.

TI  == the influence of race and gender on periodontal microflora.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that demographic characteristics of subject populations influence both the incidence of periodontal diseases and various aspects of host responses to periodontal bacteria. in this study we analyzed the  components of the subgingival microflora from individuals with adult periodontitis, early onset periodontitis, gingivitis, and periodontal health as a function of gender and race (black and white). clinical categories were analyzed  individually so that there were no differences in the clinical characteristics of the sampled sites. no significant differences were noted in the subgingival microflora between males and females. when either the first two bacterial samples from each subject or all bacterial samples taken from each subject were included  in the analysis, it was found that porphyromonas gingivalis was more significantly associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group. when all samples were considered in the analysis, it was found that peptostreptococcus anaerobius was associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group, while fusobacterium nucleatum was associated with white subjects in both the adult periodontitis and early onset periodontitis groups. thus a limited number of important bacterial components of the subgingival microflora are influenced by the race and diagnosis of the subject group.

TI  == interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and transforming growth factor-beta production by human gingival mononuclear cells following stimulation with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == gingival mononuclear cell production of interleukin 1 (il-1), interleukin 6 (il-6) and transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) after stimulation with the  putative periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum was investigated. using an elisa method, gingival mononuclear cells extracted from 18 adult periodontitis subjects were found to be producing il-1. however, il-1 activity could only be detected in 5 out of these 18 cases when tested using a thymocyte proliferation bio-assay, suggesting the presence of il-1 inhibitors. depletion of monocytes from peripheral blood cultures resulted in a significant decrease in il-1 activity following p. gingivalis stimulation while there was no effect in the level of il-1 activity following stimulation with f. nucleatum. this suggests that p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum stimulate different  cell types to produce il-1. like il-1, il-6 production by gingival mononuclear cells was significantly greater than that produced by the control peripheral blood mononuclear cells. following p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum stimulation, higher levels of il-6 could be detected; however, both organisms stimulated similar levels. intracytoplasmic immunofluorescence staining demonstrated a lower percent tgf-beta+ cells in bacterial stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures compared with cells in medium alone. in the gingival mononuclear cell cultures, the percentage tgf-beta+ cells peaked at day 1 in f. nucleatum-stimulated, whereas in p. gingivalis-stimulated cultures the peak tgf-beta+ cells occurred at day 3, again suggesting stimulation of different cell subsets. these results illustrate that different periodontopathic bacteria may stimulate different cell types to produce cytokines which may have synergistic or antagonistic effects.

TI  == localization of the fusobacterium nucleatum t18 adhesin activity mediating coaggregation with porphyromonas gingivalis t22.
AB  == adherence of pathogenic bacteria is often an essential first step in the infectious process. the ability of bacteria to adhere to one another, or to coaggregate, may be an important factor in their ability to colonize and function as pathogens in the periodontal pocket. previously, a strong and specific coaggregation was demonstrated between two putative periodontal pathogens, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. the interaction appeared to be mediated by a protein adhesin on the f. nucleatum cells and a carbohydrate receptor on the p. gingivalis cells. in this investigation, we have localized the adhesin activity of f. nucleatum t18 to the outer membrane on the basis of the ability of f. nucleatum t18 vesicles to coaggregate with whole cells of p. gingivalis t22 and the ability of the outer membrane fraction of f. nucleatum t18 to inhibit coaggregation between whole cells of f. nucleatum t18 and p. gingivalis t22. proteolytic pretreatment of the f. nucleatum t18 outer membrane fraction resulted in a loss of coaggregation inhibition, confirming the proteinaceous nature of the adhesin. the f. nucleatum t18 outer membrane fraction was found to be enriched for several proteins, including a 42-kda major outer membrane protein which appeared to be exposed on the bacterial cell surface. fab  fragments prepared from antiserum raised to the 42-kda outer membrane protein were found to partially but specifically block coaggregation. these data support  the conclusion that the 42-kda major outer membrane protein of f. nucleatum t18 plays a role in mediating coaggregation with p. gingivalis t22.

TI  == monoclonal antibodies to lipopolysaccharide of four oral bacteria associated with periodontal disease.
AB  == periodontal disease is a common inflammatory disease which erodes the supporting  structures of the teeth, and is initiated by a subgingival infection with selected gram-negative bacteria. monoclonal antibodies (mab) to lipopolysaccharide (lps) of four periodontal pathogens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis were examined for specificity and their ability to bind these pathogens in a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (pcfia). the mab selected were specific for their homologous bacteria and when tested against a large battery of other bacteria, including 16 genera and 46 species, were found not to cross-react with heterologous species. when each of the mab was challenged with 40 or more homologous freshly isolated bacteria, more than 90% were positive. non-cellular antigens in the form of soluble lps and extracellular vesicles were examined for their ability to bind to assay components and alter the apparent results of the assay. lps was found to have potential as an interfering agent if bound to assay components prior to sample treatment, but this non-specific binding was significantly reduced when a  surfactant was added to the buffers. extracellular vesicles had no significant effect on the estimation of p. gingivalis by the assay.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == dna probe and enzyme analysis in periodontal diagnostics.
AB  == recent research in periodontology has indicated that a finite number of bacterial species are associated with periodontal disease. this has generated the hypothesis that periodontal disease is essentially an infection due to one or more of the putative periodontopathogens; i.e., the specific plaque hypothesis (sph). this microbial specificity paradigm has already changed the way researchers and some clinicians view periodontal disease. the clinician must heed several cautions signs, however, if he is to use the sph to provide treatment options that could enhance the delivery of care. there are several diagnostic technologies that can be used to detect and semi-quantitate those bacterial species that have been identified as periodontopathogens. this paper discusses diagnostic tests based upon the detection in plaque of dna segments or enzyme activity(ies) that are unique for one or more of the suspected periodontopathogens.

TI  == bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (bcfia) for the detection of periodontopathogens in plaque.
AB  == a bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (bcfia) was developed to rapidly detect periodontopathic bacteria in human plaque samples. the bcfia utilized fluorescent-tagged monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed against the lipopolysaccharide of selected gram-negative bacteria. microorganisms identified  in plaque using the bcfia included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the immunoassay procedure involved combining a patient's plaque sample with a species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mab and then incubating the mixture in a specialized microtiter plate allowing the mab to bind to its homologous bacteria. bound and unbound fluorescent-tagged mabs were separated by  filtration and total bound bacterial fluorescence was determined with a fluorimeter. the relative number of a bacterial species in a given plaque sample  was estimated by reference to a standard curve carried through the bcfia. the bcfia had a lower detection limit of near 10(4) specific bacterial cells in a mixed bacterial preparation or plaque sample. when compared to cultivable flora procedures in detecting the 4 periodontopathogens, the bcfia had high levels of statistical sensitivity, 97% to 100%, while statistical specificity ranged between 57% and 92%. there was a 71% to 82% agreement between bcfia and dna probe methodology in detecting periodontopathogens in plaque. the bcfia, when compared  to cultivable flora, offers the advantage of evaluating both live and dead bacterial cells in plaque. this may in part, if not fully, explain the lower specificity values of the bcfia when compared to cultivable flora. screening plaque samples for periodontopathic bacteria is considerably faster and results in a greater frequency of detection with bcfia than cultivable flora based methods.

AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a major pathogen in periodontitis. to determine the role of t cells in the regulation of this disease, a method was developed for the generation and characterization of rat t-cell clones with antigen specificity to p. gingivalis whole cells. the clones studied so far demonstrated a t-helper (th) phenotype w3/13+, w3/25+, ox8- and ox22-. these t-cell clones proliferated in vitro in response to p. gingivalis, but not to other bacteria (prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, wolinella recta, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sanguis). limiting dilution analysis showed w3/25+, ox8- t cells preferentially respond to p. gingivalis, rather than w3/25-, ox8+ t cells. p. gingivalis-reactive w3/25+ t cells belonged to the ox22- population, suggesting that the ox22- t cells may represent memory cells. all clones tested produced interferon gamma, but not interleukin 2. the cloned t-cell f1 significantly enhanced p. gingivalis-specific antibody production (p < 0.03). the availability  of these cloned t cells should bring new insight into the mechanism by which t cells regulate oral health and periodontal disease.

AB  == activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type i collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kda trypsinlike protease from porphyromas gingivalis (atcc 33277), a 95-kda chymotrypsinlike protease from treponema denticola (atcc 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. the bacteria included were prevotella intermedia (atcc 25261), prevotella buccae (es 57), prevotella oris (atcc 33573), porphyromonas endodontalis (es 54b), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 295222), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), mitsuokella dentalis (dsm 3688), and streptococcus mitis (atcc 15909). none of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. the fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. the proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of timp-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. none of the studied bacteria, proteases from p. gingivalis and t. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. however, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal  tissue destruction.

TI  == sensitization of oral bacteria in biofilms to killing by light from a low-power laser.
AB  == biofilms of streptococcus sanguis, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were prepared on the surfaces  of agar plates and a number of compounds were screened for their ability to sensitize bacteria in these biofilms to killing by light from a 7.3 mw helium/neon (he/ne) laser. toluidine blue o and methylene blue enabled detectable killing of all four target organisms after exposure to he/ne light for 30 s. aluminium disulphonated phthalocyanine, haematoporphyrin hcl and haematoporphyrin ester were effective photosensitizers of only some of the target organisms. these findings suggest that lethal photosensitization may be an effective means of eliminating periodontopathogenic bacteria from dental plaque.

TI  == the breakdown and utilization of peptides by strains of fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == it has been claimed that most strains of fusobacterium nucleatum require peptides rather than free amino acids for growth. in contrast, we have shown that, under continuous culture conditions, all strains tested grow in a chemically defined medium (cdm). the purposes of this study were to determine whether resting cells  of f. nucleatum could attack unsubstituted peptides and whether growing cells could utilize a peptide fraction prepared from a commercial peptone. resting cells cleaved all 19 peptides, containing 3-6 residues, and the 4 key energy-yielding amino acids--glu, his, ser and lys--were rapidly taken up. a hydrophilic casitone fraction, rich in glu, promoted growth and peptides < 1 kda  were rapidly utilized. the cleaved residues metabolized were those previously shown to limit growth in cdm: glu, ser, his and lys. the endopeptidase activities of porphyromonas gingivalis would provide the necessary peptides for the growth of f. nucleatum, which may partly explain why these two organisms frequently coexist in periodontally diseased sites.

TI  == role of porphyromonas gingivalis 40-kda outer membrane protein in the aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important pathogen in periodontitis, produces extracellular vesicles that aggregate with actinomyces viscosus cells. a 40-kda outer membrane protein (omp)-coding gene from p. gingivalis was cloned and the protein was found to be localized in these vesicles. the recombinant 40-kda omp did not show aggregation activity. however, affinity-purified antibody against the recombinant protein significantly inhibited aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles with a. viscosus cells. the antibody also inhibited cellular coaggregation of several strains of p. gingivalis with a. viscosus cells, but not with other periodontal pathogens. moreover, aggregation of a. viscosus cells with p. gingivalis vesicles was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pre-treatment  of the a. viscosus cells with the recombinant protein. these findings suggest that the 40-kda omp may be an important aggregation factor of p. gingivalis.

TI  == the establishment of human t cell lines reactive with specific periodontal bacteria.
AB  == human t cell lines (tcls) were obtained by stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) with the 2 periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis fdc-381 and fusobacterium nucleatum fdc-263. after the first round of  stimulation and rest, the cells responded specifically to the bacteria originally used to establish each line. throughout the culture period, the responsiveness of each of the tcls to their specific bacteria increased. phenotypic analysis of the tcls revealed heterogeneity of cell types. in both tcls approximately 80% of the  cells were t cells, all of which bore the alpha beta t cell receptor. the p. gingivalis-reactive tcl (pg-tcl) showed approximately equal proportions of cd4+ and cd8+ cells, whereas the f. nucleatum-reactive tcl (fn-tcl) was predominantly  cd4+. the expression of cd25, hla-dr, cd45ra and cd29 on these cd4+ cells varied  throughout the culture period of 45 days. these results demonstrate that it is possible to establish long-term t cell lines reacting to specific periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == sensitization of oral bacteria to killing by low-power laser radiation.

AB  == immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. a total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of actinomyces, porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium. two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. the mean percentages of igg1, igg2, igm, and iga in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. elisa and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. the highest titers determined by elisa belonged to the igg1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. the concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by elisa and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. the functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of actinomyces, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, prevotella, streptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides, actinobacillus,  haemophilus, capnocytophaga, and wolinella. minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. high-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.

TI  == synergistic effect of pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == our previous studies have shown that pyrophosphate (ppi), the anticalculus component of tartar-control dentifrices, inhibits the growth of organisms associated with coronal and root surface caries. the purposes of this investigation were to: 1) determine if periodontal pathogens are similarly susceptible to the growth-inhibitory properties of ppi; and 2) determine if combinations of pyrophosphate-sodium dodecyl sulfate (ppi-sds) inhibit growth synergistically. porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus (formerly  wolinella recta) were cultured in appropriate enriched media under anaerobic conditions. inhibition assays were performed in tubes containing media supplemented with ppi and/or sds. a range of concentrations of ppi and sds in 2-fold increments was employed, with each concentration assayed in triplicate. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) analyses revealed all of the bacteria were susceptible to ppi and sds, with mics of 0.67% (25 mm) and 0.01% w/v respectively. combination studies with ppi-sds showed much greater growth inhibition against p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans than achieved with  the agents individually. determination of fractional inhibitory concentration indices indicated a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect. under the constraints of the conditions employed, these studies demonstrate the efficacy of ppi-sds combinations in inhibiting the growth of periodontal pathogens. it is conceivable that these compounds may have clinical benefit as a subgingival irrigant.

TI  == cd45ra and cd45ro positive cd4 cells in human peripheral blood and periodontal disease tissue before and after stimulation with periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == flow cytometric analysis was used to examine naive and primed or memory cd4 cells extracted from periodontal lesions compared with cells from peripheral blood of healthy subjects before and after stimulation with the periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. in peripheral blood, approximately 60% and 40% of cd4 cells were cd45ro+ and cd45ra+ respectively at day 0. phytohaemagglutinin (pha) induced cd45ro expression on almost 100% of cd4  cells. however, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum stimulation did not cause any significant change in percentage of cd45ro+ cd4 cells except for a loss of antigen at day 6 together with re-expression at day 7, which also occurred on cells cultured in medium only. cd45ra expression on pha and bacterial-stimulated  peripheral blood cd4 cells remained fairly stable for the 10-d culture period. greater than 90% cd4 cells extracted from healthy or marginal gingivitis (h/mg) and adult periodontitis (ap) lesions were cd45ro+ and this was maintained on ap cells throughout the 6-d culture period, except for a small decrease in the percentage of positive cells induced by p. gingivalis at day 3. approximately 9%  cd4 cells from h/mg tissue were cd45ra+, but about 22% ap cells expressed this antigen, and this increased again in p. gingivalis- and f. nucleatum-stimulated cultures after 3 d. therefore, in peripheral blood p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum do not act as nonspecific t-cell mitogens and, in ap cells, these bacteria induce changes in phenotype, supporting previous data that although they may be polyclonal b-cell activators, they activate antigen specific t-cells.

TI  == different responses in b cells induced by porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == a phenotypic study had shown that gingival b cells respond differently to two periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum.  further investigation now shows a reduction in the percentage of ki-67 + t cells  in cultures of gingival and peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with p. gingivalis for 3 and 6 days, respectively, but no suppression of ki-67 expression in b cells in response to either p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. depletion studies of cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that in the absence of cd4 cells, the percentage of cd19+ and cd20+ b cells stimulated with p. gingivalis increased after 6 days whereas depletion of cd8 cells resulted in a rise in the percentage of f. nucleatum- and p. gingivalis-stimulated b cells, although this was not significant in the case of p. gingivalis. specific antibody to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum was found in culture supernatants of gingival but not of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating a possible higher frequency of antigen-specific b cells in periodontal lesions. igg was the predominant isotype in both gingival and control peripheral blood cultures, followed closely by iga in gingival cultures. f. nucleatum stimulated higher levels of ig in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells than p. gingivalis or cells cultured in medium only, whereas in gingival cell cultures, stimulation  by p. gingivalis appeared to result in higher levels of igg. also ig was present  at day 3 in gingival cultures, whereas in the blood cell cultures, ig was only detected at day 6, further suggesting a degree of activation of of gingival b cells.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == correlation of haemagglutination activity with trypsin-like protease activity of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium associated with various forms of periodontal disease. several characteristics of p. gingivalis are thought to contribute to its pathogenicity; these include haemagglutination and trypsin-like protease activity. previous studies suggest an association between haemagglutination and trypsin-like protease activity of p. gingivalis. to investigate this, two complementary quantitative experimental approaches were taken. five independent mutants of p. gingivalis deficient in trypsin-like protease activity were shown to exhibit reduced haemagglutination activity. in addition, enhancers (cysteine and dithiothreitol) and inhibitors (n-ethylmaleimide, n-p-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride) of trypsin-like protease activity were shown, respectively, to significantly enhance and inhibit haemagglutination activity of  washed, wild-type p. gingivalis cells (p less than 0.05, paired t-test). statistical analysis indicated a strong correlation between haemagglutination and trypsin-like protease activity (r = 0.85, p less than 0.001, spearman rank correlation). the effect of the protease enhancers and inhibitors on haemagglutination activity was specific for p. gingivalis, as they did not significantly change the haemagglutination activity of fusobacterium nucleatum. these results suggest that the proteolytic site of the trypsin-like protease participates in haemagglutination activity of p. gingivalis.

TI  == phenotypic analysis of b-cells extracted from human periodontal disease tissue.
AB  == b-cells extracted from periodontal disease tissue were analyzed for the presence  of activation markers using a range of monoclonal antibodies. in adult periodontitis (ap), 6% of b-cells expressed the il-2 receptor (cd25) compared with 1-2% in peripheral blood and healthy or marginal gingivitis (h/mg) gingival  b-cells. there was also an increase in the mean percentage of igd-positive b-cells and a decrease in cd21 and cd22 expression. in both ap and h/mg lesions,  20-22% of the b-cells expressed cd23 compared with less than 5% in peripheral blood. as b-cells are activated by day 3 in culture and start differentiating into immunoglobulin-secreting cells by day 6, b-cell phenotypes were assayed at these times in this study. following stimulation with the periodontopathic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis, the expression of cd23, cd21 and cd22 on b-cells extracted from ap lesions remained relatively constant over the 6-d culture period. however, with fusobacterium nucleatum stimulation, there was a significant decrease in cd23, cd21 and cd22 expression after 3 d in culture, which corresponds to the activation time for b-cells. these results show that b-cells extracted from periodontal disease tissue display a range of activation markers and on stimulation, demonstrate differing responses to individual periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == use of synthetic oligonucleotide dna probes for the identification of different strains of fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the ability of three different oligonucleotide probes to identify different oral  strains of fusobacterium nucleatum was tested. probes 119 and 214 were designed on the basis of known amino acid sequences from the n-terminal end of an outer membrane protein of f. nucleatum strain fev1. probe h 2.1, was a randomly cloned  chromosomal dna fragment of 2.1 kbp. the specificities of the probes were examined by testing each of them against a panel of five other species of fusobacterium (six strains), oral and non-oral, and also against seven different  oral species of six other genera. the chromosomal dna of the bacteria to be examined was digested to completion using the restriction enzymes hincii, hindiii, ecori, ecorv and sau3ai. digests were run on agarose gels and subjected  to southern blotting before being hybridized with the probe in question. the results were confirmed by running a slot blot of genomic dna from all of the 19 strains and hybridizing with a probe h 2.1. probe h 2.1 turned out to be the most specific and useful of the three probes investigated. by use of this probe, interstrain identification of the six different strains of f. nucleatum could be  performed and the strains could be distinguished from other oral species found in the oral cavity, such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, eikenella corrodens and leptotrichia buccalis. the probe reacted weakly with other non-oral species of the genus fusobacterium, and there was no problem in distinguishing between the different strains.

TI  == systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in the cynomolgus monkey: development of methodology and longitudinal responses during ligature-induced disease.
AB  == systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms were studied during ligature-induced periodontal disease in a non-human primate (nhp) model. methodology was developed using elisa techniques to assess total igg and igm levels in the serum from the nhp. in addition, an elisa was developed utilizing affinity-purified anti-human isotype reagents to detect nhp serum antibody responses to porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results showed that the anti-human reagents detected igg and igm from macaca fascicularis with an efficiency of 25-35% and 50-60%, respectively. following ligation, groups of nhp  were treated with an immunomodulator ("thymopentin", tp5) or placebo to examine the effect of the t-cell stimulating agent on periodontitis and host responses. no differences were noted in total serum igg and igm levels for individual nhp or between groups when baseline, ligation and treatment intervals were compared. however, following ligation, 8/12 nhp exhibited significant increases in igg and/or igm antibody to p. gingivalis that were coincident with increases in the percentage of this microorganism in the subgingival plaque from the ligated sites. during the treatment phase, the antibody levels in the placebo group continued to increase, while the levels in the tp5-treated group stabilized. the  findings in this study indicate that the emergence of a microorganism in the subgingival plaque (p. gingivalis) during the conversion from gingivitis to progressing periodontitis in the nhp, elicits a systemic antibody response that is specific for the microorganism.

AB  == the relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. a subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using gracey curettes. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17  of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. the % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. the species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the  active and inactive subjects were as follows; b gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; w. recta 1.3, 0.6; b. intermedius i 2.5, 2.0; b. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; s. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; p. micros 1.5, 1.5; b. intermedius ii 1.6, 1.7; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; s. sanguis i 1.8, 2.1; s. sanguis ii 2.7, 3.0; v. parvula 3.9, 4.2; c. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == predominant cultivable flora in pericoronitis.
AB  == the predominant cultivable flora in pericoronitis was investigated by culturing pus from affected sites in 20 patients. twenty colonies were picked at random from non-selective plates and identified using conventional biochemical and physiological tests, analysis of metabolic end-products by gas chromatography and protein profile analysis. the most frequently isolated organisms were prevotella  (bacteroides) intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella species, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis. porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis was not isolated and asaccharolytic eubacterium species were virtually absent. the predominant cultivable microflora in pericoronitis was found to be highly anaerobic in nature and superficially similar to that found in chronic periodontitis, although proposed marker organisms of severe periodontitis were absent.

TI  == tetracycline fiber therapy monitored by dna probe and cultural methods.
AB  == oligonucleotide dna probe and selective cultural methods were compared in their ability to monitor 6 putative periodontal pathogens in a study evaluating local tetracycline fiber therapy. subgingival plaque was sampled from 4 sites in each of 20 subjects. samples were taken before and after therapy from sites assigned to the following test groups: tetracycline (tc) fiber, scaling and root planing,  control fiber, and untreated. each sample was analyzed by both dna probe and cultural methods. total anaerobic cultivable counts, porphyromonas (bacteroides)  gingivalis and prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius) were enumerated on nonselective blood agar. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum and wolinella recta were isolated on selective media. tc fiber therapy and scaling reduced total cultivable counts from an initial value of 1 x 10(7) to approximately 2 x 10(5) following therapy. total counts at untreated sites and at sites with control fibers did not change from baseline. a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens were detected more frequently by the cultural method; the other monitored species were detected more frequently by dna probes than by the cultural methods. agreements between methods were: 77.2% for a. actinomycetemcomitans; 72.2% for p. intermedia; 75.6% for e. corrodens; 39.4% for f. nucleatum; 35.6% for p. gingivalis; and 68.9% for w. recta. limitations of the selective cultural methods used probably contributed to the discrepancies for p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. dna probe and cultural methods indicated comparable levels of suppression of the monitored species following tc fiber therapy and scaling. the microbiota of control fiber and untreated sites did not appear to be significantly altered by either method.

TI  == multicenter evaluation of tetracycline fiber therapy. iii. microbiological response.
AB  == in a multicenter study of the effects of tetracycline (tc) fiber therapy, subgingival plaque samples were tested for 6 probable periodontal pathogens by dna probe analysis. levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius), and wolinella recta were quantitatively determined in samples taken at baseline, and immediately after tc  fiber removal, control fiber removal, and scaling and root planing. at untreated  sites, samples were taken at baseline and 10 d later. specificity of the dna probe method was evaluated by testing the hybridization to 83 reference cultures. interaction of the f. nucleatum probe with fusobacterium periodonticum, and of the w. recta probe with wolinella curva were the only cross-hybridizations noted. species were detected at an average sensitivity of 2.9 x 10(4) organisms per sample. approximately 70% of sites were initially infected with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum; 50% with p. intermedia and e. corrodens; infections with w. recta and a. actinomycetemcomitans were less common (36% and 11% respectively). the average numbers of organisms found in the plaque samples were highest for f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia (ca. 10(6)). e. corrodens, w. recta,  and a. actinomycetemcomitans occurred at 10-fold lower levels. bacterial numbers  and proportions of species in subgingival sites from the five centers did not differ appreciably. both tc fiber therapy and scaling decreased the number of sites infected with all the monitored species. the bacterial composition at untreated sites and at sites where control fibers were placed was not significantly altered. the percentage reduction of the number of sites with detectable infection varied with each species: from 86% with w. recta to approximately 40% with p. gingivalis. significant reduction of pocket depth and bleeding occurred at tc fiber-treated sites infected with each of the species. significant attachment level gain occurred only at sites initially infected with  p. gingivalis and treated with tc fibers.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == subgingival microflora of advanced periodontitis in the dominican republic.
AB  == a study of the predominant subgingival microflora was carried out in 24 periodontitis patients, 18 to 60 years of age, in santo domingo, dominican republic. paper point sampling, transport in vmga iii, and conventional microbiological techniques were utilized. direct microscopic examination revealed that cocci and nonmotile organisms made up 85% of the total organisms and spirochetes as little as 3%. nonselective culturing showed gram-negative organisms to constitute 53% of total isolates. fusobacterium nucleatum averaged 15%, black-pigmented anaerobes 7%, and peptostreptococcus micros 10% of the cultivable microflora. enteric rods and acinetobacter species were recovered from 16 patients and comprised 23% of the cultivable flora. enterobacter cloacae occurred in 8 patients, klebsiella oxytoca in 3 patients, and 7 other species in  10 patients. parallel studies have found a significantly lower prevalence of enteric rods in advanced periodontitis patients in the usa. in conclusion, fewer  spirochetes and markedly more enteric rods seem to inhabit adult periodontitis lesions in santo domingo patients compared to those in usa. high levels of subgingival enteric rods in periodontitis patients in santo domingo may have important prophylactic and therapeutic implications.

TI  == adherence to experimental pellicle of rough-type lipopolysaccharides from subgingival plaque bacteria.
AB  == the adherence of lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from periodontal disease-associated bacteria to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) and serum-coated ha beads was examined by chromogenic limulus activity (toxicolor test). phenol-water extracted lps preparations from bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and rough-type lps from escherichia coli adhered to s-ha and serum-coated beads and agglutinated human erythrocytes. the adhered lpss to s-ha and serum-coated ha beads were not removed by vigorous washing with distilled water. lpss from bacteroides (porphyromonas) gingivalis strains and wild-type e. coli did not adhere to s-ha,  serum-coated ha beads or show hemagglutinating activity. sds-page patterns stained with silver stain showed that lpss adhered to s-ha, and serum-coated ha beads and erythrocytes possessed a distinct fast-migrating band similar to rough-type lps. b. gingivalis lpss possessed slow-migrating and repeating ladder  bands similar to wild-type lps.

TI  == fluorescence immunoassay for detecting periodontal bacterial pathogens in plaque.
AB  == a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay has been modified into a bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (bcfia) to rapidly detect periodontopathic bacteria in human plaque samples. the bcfia utilizes fluorescently tagged monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed against the lipopolysaccharide of selected gram-negative plaque bacteria. microorganisms closely associated with periodontal disease that can be identified in plaque with the bcfia include porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens. briefly, the procedure involved mixing a patient's plaque sample or other bacterial preparation with a species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mab in a specialized microtiter plate. this mixture was incubated to allow binding of the mab to its homologous bacteria. the bound and unbound fluorescent tagged mabs were separated by filtration in the modified microtiter plate, and the total bacterial bound fluorescence was determined with  a fluorimeter. the number of a specific bacterial species in a given plaque sample or other bacterial suspension was estimated by reference to a primary standard carried through the bcfia. the lower detection limit of the bcfia was 10(3) to 10(4) bacterial cells from single cultures of bacteria or 10(4) bacterial cells in mixed cultures. the coefficient of variation within and between plates for each of the five bacterium-specific mabs in screening plaque for the periodontal pathogens was less than 10%. these results demonstrate that microbes in plaque can be used as the solid phase in the bcfia to detect and quantitate mabs associated with specific bacteria quickly and reliably.

TI  == isolation and purification of bacteriocin from prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius).
AB  == thirty-three out of 46 strains of prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius) isolated from gingival deposits of patients with adult periodontitis possessed the ability to inhibit growth of p. intermedia strain atcc 25611, and 6 of the 33 showed strong inhibitory activity. thirteen isolates did not have the ability to  inhibit the growth of p. intermedia strain atcc 25611. an inhibition factor from  one of the isolates, p. intermedia th14 which had strong inhibition, was purified and characterized. bacteriocin th14 activity was effective against only p. intermedia atcc 25611 and fusobacterium nucleatum, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including p. intermedia atcc 33563, porphyromonas gingivalis (bacteroides gingivalis), capnocytophaga sputigena and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellas were not inhibited by bacteriocin th14. bacteriocin th14 was heat sensitive, proteinaceous with molecular weight of 1,700 daltons and inhibited the growth of strain atcc 25611 in 15 minutes. the growth inhibition of p. intermedia atcc 25611 by bacteriocin th14 was found to be due to the bactericidal activity of the bacteriocin.

TI  == the use of genomic dna fingerprinting in studies of the epidemiology of bacteria  in periodontitis.
AB  == recent studies of microbial epidemiology emphasizing the genetic organization and distribution of organisms associated with orofacial infections have led to new insights into the possible origins of pathogenicity. studies into genetic heterogeneity, acquisition and transmission of these organisms have been markedly advanced by the utilization of the powerful technique of genomic dna fingerprinting. characteristic fingerprints for each bacterial isolate can be produced by cleavage of high molecular weight genomic dna by restriction endonucleases. it is assumed that each dna fingerprint represents a clonal type.  in this report, we review and analyze studies of the epidemiology of bacteria associated with orofacial infections with an emphasis on periodontal disease. studies of nontypable (nt) haemophilus influenzae associated with recurrent otitis media illustrate the utility of this technique. dna fingerprinting clearly demonstrates genetic heterogeneity of nt h. influenzae isolates, and clonality of infection of any individual. furthermore, dna fingerprinting has shown that the same clonal type is seen in siblings concurrently suffering from otitis media, suggesting horizontal transmission within the family. studies of mutans streptococci also show extensive genetic heterogeneity and show vertical transmission of a predominant clonal type only from mother to infant, but not from father to infant. studies of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans show considerable genetic heterogeneity among monkey isolates. thus far, three clonal  types have been reported with dna fingerprinting among isolates from periodontal  patients, but additional genetic heterogeneity can be found using specific dna fragments as probes in hybridization experiments. intrafamilial transmission of a. actinomycetemcomitans has been demonstrated. porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis shows extensive genetic heterogeneity and case reports suggest clonal  infection of any one individual. in contrast, results with dna fingerprinting of  eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides intermedius show that individuals may be infected with 2 or more clonal types. these studies point to the great potential of dna fingerprinting for investigating the epidemiology of putative orofacial pathogens. such studies with periodontal microorganisms will likely reveal steps in the acquisition, intraoral and person-to-person transmission, which then could possibly be inhibited or interfered with to prevent periodontal disease or its recurrence.

TI  == reactivity of igg from explant cultures of periapical lesions with implicated microorganisms.
AB  == the presence of igg in periapical inflammatory lesions suggests that immune responses participate in the disease process. the purpose of this investigation was to study the reactivity of igg from the supernatant fluids of explant cultures of periapical lesions with microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. ninety periapical lesions that had been contiguous with the apex of a root were removed and maintained in explant cultures. a dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-elisa) was used to demonstrate the presence of igg in the supernatant fluids of the explant cultures reactive with a panel of microorganisms associated with infections of endodontic origin. the percentages of reactivity by dot-elisa follow: bacteroides intermedius (84%), b.  buccae (12%), porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis (50%), p. endodontalis (58%), p. asaccharolyticus (17%), peptostreptococcus micros (44%), p. anaerobius  (26%), eubacterium alactolyticum (34%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14%), and actinomyces israelii (6%). at least one of the three species of b. intermedius, p. gingivalis, or p. endodontalis tested gave a positive dot-elisa with 89% of the supernatant fluids from explant cultures of periapical lesions. a lack of cross reactivity of igg in supernatant fluids from explants of periapical lesions was demonstrated for the four strains of black-pigmented bacteroides/porphyromonas by dot-elisa.

AB  == twenty-seven patients with a recent history of periodontal abscesses and/or loss  of gingival attachment level (gal) despite active periodontal therapy were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. clinical measurements and subgingival scaling were performed every 2 months. when a site exhibited greater than or equal to 2 mm loss of gal or a periodontal abscess, patients were administered either doxycycline at a dosage of 200 mg to start and  100 mg per day for 3 weeks, or a placebo. clinical measurements of gal and microbial analysis of subgingival plaque at study and control sites were made at  the time of active disease and at intervals of 1 week and 7 months after completion of the drug regime. plaque samples were screened for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), bacteroides intermedius (bi), eikenella corrodens (ec) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) by indirect immunofluorescence antibody technique and for spirochetes (sp) using ryu's stain. based on presence or absence analysis of the  sum scores of the 6 pathogens, both the placebo (n = 10) and the doxycycline groups (n = 17) exhibited similar scores at the time of detection of active disease (mean placebo = 2.38 +/- 0.32; mean doxycycline = 2.95 +/- 0.27; p = 0.18). one week after treatment, the probability of detection was unchanged in the placebo group (mean placebo = 3.14 +/- 0.47), but was significantly reduced in the doxycycline group (mean doxycycline = 1.77 +/- 0.26; p = 0.0002). study (active) sites exhibited scores 2 to 3 times higher than control (inactive) sites before doxycycline treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  == animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. the rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of  periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues  with ligatures. experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). the studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like streptococcus sobrinus and actinomyces viscosus are  associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. however, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. in the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == the rna polymerases of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum are unrelated to the rna polymerase of escherichia coli.
AB  == western blot analysis that used antisera to the e. coli core enzyme and sigma factors was used for examination of the rna polymerase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. both antisera reacted with proteins in a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans whole-cell extracts. reactions were seen with some f. nucleatum proteins when the anti-core rna polymerase antisera were used,  but the cross-reacting proteins were not of an expected molecular weight for beta or beta'. no reaction with f. nucleatum proteins was seen when extracts were reacted with antisera to e. coli sigma factor. there were no cross-reacting proteins detected in p. gingivalis extracts with either antisera. these results suggest that e. coli rna polymerase may not be sufficiently similar to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase for e. coli rna polymerase to recognize p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum promoters. partially purified p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase exhibited a specificity for a p. gingivalis dna template, while having a decreased activity from an e. coli dna template. the antibiotic sensitivity profile of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase activity was shown to differ from that of e. coli, with these activities not being affected by rifampicin, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin. we conclude that the efficient cloning and expression of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum genes in e. coli will require the use of promoter-containing expression vectors.

AB  == the phagocytic ingestion of clinical isolates and reference strains of bacteroides buccae, bacteroides oris, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) was studied. special attention was focused on the hydrophobicity of the strains. b. buccae strains, less or equally hydrophobic than pmns, were poorly ingested without opsonization. hydrophobic, but not hydrophilic, strains of b. oris and both hydrophilic and hydrophobic p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum strains were readily ingested without  opsonization. hydrophobicity thus contributes to the adherence of bacteria to pmns in some, but not all, species tested. normal human serum enhanced the ingestion of b. buccae, but failed to do so after heat-inactivation. heat-inactivation of the immune serum to b. buccae strain es57 did not reduce opsonic activity suggesting that specific antibodies enhanced the ingestion of b. buccae.

TI  == [ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro].
AB  == this study was designed to analyze the succession of an ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro. bacterial strains used in this study, were fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, porphyromonas gingivalis 381, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10557 and streptococcus mutans omz 176. the bacterial  cells, associated with beneficial, pathogenic or plaque forming activity, were cultured in brain heart infusion medium including hemin, vitamin-k1, l-cysteine hydrochloride and sodium thioglycollate under anaerobic condition (n2: 80%, co2:  10%, h2: 10%). the effect of environmental eh and ph on the growth of bacterial cells was investigated in single and mixed culture, and eh and ph tolerance tests were also undertaken. the environmental ph decreased from ph 7.0 to ph 4.9 accompanied with the growth of s. mutans omz 176 and s. sanguis atcc 10557 in both single and mixed culture. the environmental eh increased from -308 mv to -180 mv accompanied with the growth of s. sanguis atcc 10557. the growth of pathogenic bacteria, such as f. nucleatum atcc 10953 and p. gingivalis 381, varied markedly with eh and ph. especially, the growth of p. gingivalis 381 was severely inhibited at or below ph 6.0 in an acid tolerance test, whereas the growth of f. nucleatum atcc 10953 was strongly inhibited at eh -100 mv in an eh tolerance test. the oxygen generation (10.8%) was confirmed in the anaerobic culture of s. sanguis atcc 10557. therefore, it was suggested that hydrogen peroxide produced by s. sanguis atcc 10557 was reduced to oxygen and water. these results suggest that the high eh and the low ph generated from bacterial metabolism is a powerful determinant in ecology of microbial flora in periodontal pockets.

AB  == a filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. a total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the bacteroides fragilis group,  98% of 66 b. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): b. capillosus, 4; b. levii, 2; b. denticola, 22; b. loescheii, 23; b. melaninogenicus, 32; b. forsythus, 44; and b. buccalis,  2. however, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 b. buccae isolates,  79% of 14 b. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 b. oralis isolates. sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of b. gracilis, 12 isolates of b. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of b. intermedius, or 26 isolates of b. corporis. porphyromonas (bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and p. endodontalis (8  isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of p. gingivalis were sialidase positive. sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of  10 isolates of capnocytophaga ochracea of c. sputigena but not in any of 4 c. gingivalis isolates. other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; wolinella recta, 19 isolates; eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. these data demonstrate sialidase activity in  several species of the genera bacteroides and porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.

TI  == inhibition of coaggregation between fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis by lactose and related sugars.
AB  == the coaggregation of fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 and porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis pk1924 was inhibited equally well by lactose, n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, and d-galactose, which caused 50% inhibition of coaggregation at 2 mm sugar concentration. other sugars such as d-galactosamine,  d-fucose (6-deoxy-d-galactose), and alpha-methyl- and beta-methyl-d-galactosides  also inhibited coaggregation. sugar specificity was apparent, since neither l-fucose, l-rhamnose, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, nor n-acetylneuraminic acid was an  inhibitor. protease treatment of the fusobacterium completely abolished coaggregation, whereas it had no effect on the coaggregating activity of the porphyromonad. although numerous lactose-inhibitable coaggregating pairs are known to occur among gram-positive bacteria, this report and the accompanying survey (p. e. kolenbrander, r. n. andersen, and l. v. h. moore, infect. immun. 57:3194-3203, 1989) are the first studies demonstrating the extensive nature of this type of interaction between gram-negative human oral bacteria. the significance of galactoside-inhibitable coaggregations between these two potential periodontal pathogens is discussed.

TI  == 5s ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequences in bacteroides and fusobacterium: evolutionary relationships within these genera and among eubacteria in general.
AB  == the 5s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) sequences were determined for bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides capillosus, bacteroides veroralis, porphyromonas gingivalis, anaerorhabdus furcosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium mortiferum, and fusobacterium varium. a dendrogram constructed by a clustering algorithm from these sequences, which were aligned with all other hitherto known eubacterial 5s rrna sequences, showed differences as well as similarities with respect to results derived from 16s rrna analyses. in the 5s rrna dendrogram, bacteroides clustered together with cytophaga and fusobacterium, as in 16s rrna analyses. intraphylum relationships deduced from 5s rrnas suggested that bacteroides is specifically related to cytophaga rather than to fusobacterium, as was suggested by 16s rrna analyses. previous taxonomic considerations concerning the genus bacteroides, based on biochemical and physiological data, were confirmed by the 5s rrna sequence analysis.

TI  == suspected periodontopathic microorganisms and their oral habitats in young children.
AB  == samples of subgingival plaque from 67 children, 5-7 years of age, were examined for the presence of certain suspected periodontal pathogenic species using the conventional technique of anaerobic sonification, dilution and spiral plating. when this technique was compared with a direct plating procedure which involved no preliminary dispersion and dilution of plaque specimens, it was found that the direct method resulted in double the frequency of children in whom black-pigmented bacteroides (bpb) were detected and a 10-times increase in the number of subjects harbouring actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. samples from  the tongue, tonsils and saliva were also plated using the direct technique. bpb were detected less commonly in the plaque specimens (61.3% of children) than in saliva (89.5%), or on the tongue (86.6%) and tonsils (97.1%). expressed as percentages of a pooled sample of the total bpb population, the most frequently detected species in plaque were bacteroides intermedius (44.4%) and bacteroides melaninogenicus (48.0%). the most prevalent isolate in all other oral sites was b. melaninogenicus. expressed as percentages of children in whom bpb were detected, the most frequently isolated species from plaque using the conventional dilution technique was b. intermedius (21.3%), whereas other bpb species were present in fewer than 5% of children. fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga  species were isolated most frequently from plaque but were also commonly detected in the various other oral sites.
