TI  == in vitro activity of biapenem plus rpx7009, a carbapenem combined with a serine beta-lactamase inhibitor, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == biapenem is a carbapenem being developed in combination with rpx7009, a new inhibitor of serine beta-lactamases. biapenem was tested alone and in combination with fixed concentrations of rpx7009 by agar dilution against 377 recent isolates of anaerobes. a separate panel of 27 isolates of bacteroides spp. with decreased  susceptibility or resistance to imipenem was also tested. comparator drugs included meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, metronidazole, clindamycin, and tigecycline plus imipenem, doripenem, and ertapenem for the 27 selected strains. for recent consecutive strains of bacteroides species, the mic(90) for biapenem-rpx7009 was 1 mug/ml, with a mic(90) of 4 mug/ml for meropenem. other bacteroides fragilis group species showed a mic90 of 0.5 mug/ml for both agents. the mic(90)s for biapenem-rpx7009 were 0.25 mug/ml for prevotella spp., 0.125 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum, 2 mug/ml for fusobacterium mortiferum, 0.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium varium, </= 0.5 mug/ml for gram-positive cocci and rods, and 0.03 to 8 mug/ml for clostridia. against 5 b. fragilis strains harboring a known metallo-beta-lactamase, biapenem-rpx7009 mics were comparable to those of other carbapenems (>/= 32 mug/ml). against bacteroides strains with an imipenem mic of 2 mug/ml, biapenem-rpx7009 had mics of 0.5 to 2 mug/ml, with mics of 0.5 to 32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. for strains with an imipenem mic of 4 mug/ml, the mics for biapenem-rpx7009 were  4 to 16 mug/ml, with mics of 8 to >32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. the inhibitor rpx7009 had no antimicrobial activity when tested alone, and it showed little or no potentiation of biapenem versus anaerobes. biapenem-rpx7009 showed activity comparable to that of imipenem and was superior  to meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem against imipenem-nonsusceptible bacteroides spp.

TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == [application of "microring an" to "level 1": presumptive identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == commonly isolated anaerobic gram-negative rods (4 genus 64 strains), some other important gram-negative anaerobic species (9 genus 45 strains), and cigar-shaped  clostridia (11 strains) were studied on their susceptibility patterns to 6 agents on "microring an". some modifications were made in the methods and interpretation of results. susceptibility patterns to erythromycin, rifampicin, colistin, benzylpenicillin, kanamycin, and vancomycin were following (sensitive [s], intermediate [i], resistant [r], variable [v]): for bacteroides fragilis group, v, s, r, r, r, r, respectively; for non-pigmented prevotella, v, s, v, v, r, r, respectively; for pigmented prevotella, s, s, sr, v, v, r, respectively: for fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum, r(s), s(i), s(ir), s(r), s, r, respectively; and for f. varium, r, r, s/i, r(s), s, r, respectively. some results were different from that in the data table in the instruction of "microring an", because of differences of methodology and changes of susceptibility of those species during years. as to the other groups, that are not included in the data table in the instruction, results were following: for bilophila wadsworthia, r, r, s, r, s, r, respectively; desulfovibrio, v, r(s), r, r, s, r, respectively; for cigar-shaped clostridia, v, s(r), r, r, s(r), s, respectively. "microring an" was useful for presumptive identification in genus, species, or group level, though morphological observation and some additional simple tests such as bile-sensitivity and catalase were essential.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, bacitracin, and four other antimicrobials against intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == by using an agar dilution method, the in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and five other agents were determined against 300 gram-positive and 54 gram-negative strains of intestinal anaerobes. ramoplanin was active at <or=2 microg/ml against 287 of 300 (95.7%) gram-positive organisms, including 18 strains of clostridium difficile for which mics of ramoplanin were 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml; for 3 of these, linezolid mics were 8 to 16 micro g/ml. nineteen clostridium innocuum strains for which the vancomycin mic at which 90% of strains were inhibited was 16 microg/ml were susceptible to ramoplanin at 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml and to teicoplanin at 0.125 to 1.0 microg/ml. all strains of eubacterium, actinomyces, propionibacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of ramoplanin per ml and <or=1 microg of vancomycin per ml. ramoplanin was also active at <or=4 microg/ml against 15 of 22 of the prevotella and porphyromonas strains tested, but ramoplanin mics for all 31 strains of the bacteroides fragilis group, the fusobacterium mortiferum-fusobacterium varium group, and veillonella spp. were >or=256 microg/ml. ramoplanin displays excellent activity against c. difficile and other gram-positive enteric anaerobes, including vancomycin-resistant strains; however, it has poor activity against most gram-negative anaerobes and thus potentially has a lesser effect on the ecological balance of normal fecal flora.

TI  == in vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-bacteroides fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli in europe.
AB  == objective: to investigate the in vitro activity of a range of anti-anaerobe antimicrobials against non-bacteroides fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated in europe. methods: isolates from 15 laboratories in 13 countries were identified by conventional methods. the mics of 20 antibiotics were determined by an agar dilution method. results: there were 488 prevotella spp., 174 fusobacteria, 69 porphyromonas spp., 33 bacteroides spp., 28 bilophila  wadsworthia and 16 campylobacter spp. isolates, one sutterella wadsworthensis isolate and four unidentified isolates. penicillin resistance (and diminished susceptibility to piperacillin) was most common in prevotella spp. and bilophila  wadsworthia but was also seen in many other species. all isolates, except three of bilophila wadsworthia, were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanate. most isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin (except bilophila wadsworthia) and all were susceptible to the carbapenems. clinafloxacin was the most active quinolone, followed by trovafloxacin and then sparfloxacin. most fusobacteria were inherently resistant to the macrolides, as expected, but resistance to macrolides and a ketolide in other species was uncommon. most fusobacterium varium isolates  were resistant to clindamycin, but resistance to clindamycin in all other species was rare. tetracycline resistance was common but this did not affect the glycylcyclines. there was one isolate of bacteroides putredinis resistant to chloramphenicol, and three isolates, a bacteroides ureolyticus isolate, the sutterella wadsworthensis isolate and one of the unnamed isolates, were metronidazole resistant. rifampicin was active against most prevotella and porphyromonas spp., but not against many other genera. conclusions: penicillin resistance has increased in europe among non-bacteroides fragilis anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, much of it due to beta-lactamase. acquired resistance to other beta-lactams, macrolides and rifampicin has not significantly increased, and chloramphenicol and metronidazole are unaffected. however, resistance to tetracycline is common. the new compounds, a ketolide (hmr 3647), the glycylcyclines and clinafloxacin, are highly active.

TI  == synergic activity, for anaerobes, of trovafloxacin with clindamycin or metronidazole: chequerboard and time-kill methods.
AB  == chequerboard titrations were used to test the activity of trovafloxacin, alone and in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole, against 156 gram-positive or gram-negative anaerobes, including 47 bacteroides fragilis group, 36 prevotella spp., 26 fusobacteria, 21 peptostreptococci and 26 clostridia. mic50/mic90 values (mg/l) of each drug alone against all 156 strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.5/1; clindamycin, 0.25/2; metronidazole, 1/2. synergy (fic indices </= 0.5) was seen in two strains with trovafloxacin plus clindamycin, and seven with trovafloxacin plus metronidazole. all other combinations were additive (fic indices >0. 5-2.0); no antagonism (fic indices >4.0) was seen. in addition,  synergy was tested by time-kill methodology for each of the above combinations against 12 gram-positive or gram-negative strains. results indicated that synergy (defined as a >/= 2 log(10) decrease in cfu/ml at 48 h compared with the more active drug alone) was found between trovafloxacin at or below the mic and both clindamycin and metronidazole at or below the mic in one strain each of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium varium, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and clostridium bifermentans. synergy between trovafloxacin (</=mic) and metronidazole alone was  seen in one strain each of bacteroides distasonis, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium mortiferum, p. asaccharolyticus and c. bifermentans. in many cases  of synergy, including those at the trovafloxacin mic, regrowth after 48 h, which  was commonly seen with trovafloxacin alone, was inhibited, and 99.9% killing was  observed with the combination after 48 h, but not with trovafloxacin alone.

TI  == in vitro activity of du-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of a new quinolone agent, du-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards-approved wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of du-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin,  metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. du-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every  group of organisms. mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for bacteroides fragilis (57), other b. fragilis group species (84), bilophila wadsworthia (15), clostridium species (27) (including c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum), fusobacterium nucleatum (16), fusobacterium mortiferum-f. varium group species (10), peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and prevotella species (25).

TI  == fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  == a total of 243 strains of fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. the strains included 65 (27%) fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) fusobacterium varium, three (1%) fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) fusobacterium gonidiaformans. most fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. these included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. the organisms most commonly isolated with fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. (95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.

TI  == patterns of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among anaerobic bacterial isolates in the united states.
AB  == the activity of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria has generally been moderate to poor. nalidixic acid and cinoxacin show poor activity  against almost all anaerobes. norfloxacin and enoxacin exhibit poor anaerobic activity (mic90, 8- > 256 micrograms/ml) except against clostridium perfringens,  bacteroides ureolyticus, and some eubacteria. norfloxacin is slightly more active than enoxacin against some bacteroides species. while ciprofloxacin is more active than earlier fluoroquinolones against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 4-16 micrograms/ml), fusobacteria, and peptostreptococci, its activity is often variable and its mic90 is frequently close to the maximal level attainable in serum. ofloxacin is active against b. fragilis (mic90, 4-8 micrograms/ml) but not against other species of the b. fragilis group (mic90, 8-32 micrograms/ml); other anaerobes (e.g., peptostreptococci and fusobacteria) are generally susceptible to < or = 8 micrograms of ofloxacin/ml. several newer quinolones exhibit improved anaerobic activity (although the studies yielding relevant data have often used diverse methods, small numbers and varieties of isolates, and different breakpoints). ci-960 and win 57273 inhibit 95% of strains tested at < or = 2 micrograms/ml. ci-990, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin inhibit  most anaerobes at < or = 2 micrograms/ml, but clustering around the breakpoint and strain variability have been noted. ci-990 is active against more than 85% of b. fragilis strains (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), but other species of the b. fragilis group often require > 4 micrograms/ml for inhibition; prevotella bivia,  fusobacterium varium, and fusobacterium ulcerans are usually resistant.(abstract  truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037  against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia  decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == microbiological study of hiv-related periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiota in 14 persons with hiv-periodontitis was examined. subgingival plaque samples were collected with paper points, transported in vmga  iii, and plated on anaerobic enriched brucella blood agar and various selective media. hiv-periodontitis sites revealed actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, wolinella recta, peptostreptococcus micros, and bacteroides intermedius, each averaging 7% to 16% of the cultivable subgingival flora in positive patients. high levels of spirochetes also were detected in diseased sites with phase-contrast microscopy. low levels of candida albicans or enteric gram-negative rods were recovered in the subgingival flora in 7 hiv-periodontitis patients or bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium varium, and eubacterium aerofaciens were recovered in 8 patients. these findings  suggest that the major components of the subgingival microbial flora in hiv-periodontitis are similar to those associated with adult periodontitis in systemically healthy persons. however, hiv-periodontitis lesions also may contain organisms which are rarely found in common types of periodontitis. the etiological significance of specific periodontal organisms in hiv-periodontitis awaits further longitudinal study.

TI  == 5s ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequences in bacteroides and fusobacterium: evolutionary relationships within these genera and among eubacteria in general.
AB  == the 5s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) sequences were determined for bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides capillosus, bacteroides veroralis, porphyromonas gingivalis, anaerorhabdus furcosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium mortiferum, and fusobacterium varium. a dendrogram constructed by a clustering algorithm from these sequences, which were aligned with all other hitherto known eubacterial 5s rrna sequences, showed differences as well as similarities with respect to results derived from 16s rrna analyses. in the 5s rrna dendrogram, bacteroides clustered together with cytophaga and fusobacterium, as in 16s rrna analyses. intraphylum relationships deduced from 5s rrnas suggested that bacteroides is specifically related to cytophaga rather than to fusobacterium, as was suggested by 16s rrna analyses. previous taxonomic considerations concerning the genus bacteroides, based on biochemical and physiological data, were confirmed by the 5s rrna sequence analysis.

TI  == the relationship between fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  == mixed infections with three fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. fifteen fusobacterium isolates (eight f. nucleatum, four f. necrophorum, and three f. varium) and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis, b. asaccharolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before  and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. after co-inoculation  of fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were fusobacterium isolates, while fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than group a streptococci  and e. coli. mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with fusobacterium spp. and k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa or bacteroides spp. suppression of fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with group a streptococci. the additive or synergistic capabilities of fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.

TI  == the pathogenic properties of fusobacterium and bacteroides species from wallabies and other sources.
AB  == intracerebral inoculation was more effective than intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous inoculation as a means of producing lethal infections with fusobacterium necrophorum in mice. strains varied in virulence but, of five examined, two had ld50 values as low as ca. 8000 and 14000 viable organisms. profuse bacterial multiplication in the brain was demonstrated. intravenous vaccination with a single large dose of heat-killed whole culture or washed bacterial cells failed to protect against intracerebral challenge. intracerebral  injection of other fusobacteria (f. nucleatum, f. varium and f. necrogenes) and of 22 strains belonging to 10 bacteroides spp. was without apparent effect on mice, except for a slight transient illness in some animals given b. fragilis. this organism (five strains) differed from the other bacteroides spp. tested, which included eight strains belonging to the fragilis group, in being eliminated more slowly from the mouse brain--a point that may be relevant to the special pathogenicity of b. fragilis in endogenous infections in man. there was no evidence that b. fragilis multiplied in the brain or that intravenous vaccination with a large dose of heat-killed homologous culture affected the rate at which it was eliminated.

TI  == antimicrobial drugs used in the management of anaerobic infections in children.
AB  == optimum antimicrobial therapy effective against anaerobes is required to rapidly  resolve infections due to these organisms and to prevent serious complications. selection of antimicrobial therapy should be based on clinical experience and presumptive evidence until culture and sensitivity tests are available. if an abscess should develop, surgical drainage (when possible) is of paramount importance. antimicrobial therapy for anaerobic infections should usually be given for prolonged periods because of the tendency for relapse, and should include coverage for aerobic bacteria whenever they are present. penicillin g remains the drug of choice for most anaerobic infections except those caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides spp. such as b. fragilis and b. melaninogenicus, and some strains of fusobacterium varium, which can be resistant. other antimicrobials which are available for treatment of anaerobic infections in paediatric patients, and are generally active against b. fragilis,  are carbenicillin, ticarcillin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin and cefoxitin. experience in the use of metronidazole suggests that it could be a very valuable  antimicrobial agent in the treatment of anaerobic infections. experience with synergistic antimicrobial combinations in the treatment of anaerobic infections is limited; only experimental data are available suggesting synergism between penicillin and aminoglycosides against some bacteroides spp. beta-lactamase-producing anaerobic bacteria may protect other penicillin-susceptible bacteria in mixed infections. this phenomenon may explain  penicillin failure in eradicating mixed infections.

AB  == the following results were obtained from the comparison of cefoperazone (cpz) with cefazolin (cez), cephalothin (cet) and cefoxitin (cfx) in respect to their antibacterial action against anaerobic bacteria: 1) cpz showed an antibacterial spectrum which was comparable to those of the known antibiotics, cez, cet and cfx. cpz was particularly effective against anaerobic gram-positive bacteria. 2)  cpz showed a distribution of susceptibility against clinically isolated strains which was comparable to those of cez, cet and cfx, cpz was slightly inferior to cfx against b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron, but was somewhat superior to any of cez, cet and cfx against anaerobic gram-positive rods and b. distasonis. 3) the susceptibility of b. fragilis and f. necrophorum to cpz decreased with an increase in the amount of inoculation, while c. perfringens and p. asaccharolyticus did not show any difference in susceptibility with the amount of inoculation. 4) the values of mic and mbc of cpz showed good coincidence with each other, thereby testifying its superior bactericidal action. 5) natural resistant mutants were not obtained. 6) according to the examination of resistance in a test tube, p. variabilis did not show any appreciable increase in resistance, but f. varium increased its resistance rapidly. 7) cpz was inferior only to cfx in stability against the beta-lactamase of b. fragilis. all of cez, cet and cmd lacked stability against the beta-lactamase of b. fragilis. 8) cpz was found effective for the treatment of experimental subcutaneous abscess in mice caused by f. necrophorum.

TI  == investigation of the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with crohn's disease.
AB  == the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with crohn's disease with an intestinal fistula was investigated with various serological techniques. two aerobic bacterial species, e. dispar and p. mirabilis, and four strict anaerobic bacterial species, b. fragilis ss. fragilis, f. varium and two different strains of c. perfringens, were isolated from fistula secretion of the patient. these strains were used as antigens for tube agglutination, passive hemagglutination, indirect immunofluorescence and immune hemolysis assays with serum specimens obtained before and after operation of the  patient. immune responses were demonstrated to the aerobic as well as to the anaerobic bacterial strains isolated from the patient's fistula. in connection with the operation an active immune response was demonstrated to the aerobic and  anaerobic bacterial isolates. antibodies belonging to igg and iga took part in the active immune response while igm was very little involved. antibodies responsible for passive hemagglutination reactions were resistant to treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol. antibodies to aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative rods were shown to have complement fixing activity. the importance of the demonstrated antibodies for the host's defence against normal intestinal microorganisms and the inflammatory reaction as a consequence of chronic antigenic stimulation in the diseased part of the intestine in patients with crohn's disease is discussed.

(5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.

TI  == microbial synergy in experimental intra-abdominal abscess.
AB  == intra-abdominal sepsis was studied in wistar rats by using four microbial species: escherichia coli, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and fusobacterium varium. these organisms were implanted into the peritoneal cavity singly and in all possible dual combinations. results were evaluated by mortality rates and the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses on autopsy following sacrifice after 7 days. mortality was restricted to recipients of e. coli, thus implicating coliforms in the acute lethality associated with this experimental model. intra-abdominal abscesses were produced in 61 of 95 (94%) animals that received the combination of an anaerobe and a facultative organism. abscesses failed to form with any single strain or with e. coli plus enterococci, and they were detected in one 1 of 19 animals receiving b. fragilis plus f. varium. these results suggest that intra-abdominal abscess formation is related to synergy between anaerobes and facultative bacteria.
