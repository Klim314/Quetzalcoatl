TI  == probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

TI  == identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

TI  == human cytokine responses induced by gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the normal microbiota plays an important role in the health of the host, but little is known of how the human immune system recognizes and responds to gram-positive indigenous bacteria. we have investigated cytokine responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to gram-positive cell walls (cw) derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens  (eu.a. ), eubacterium limosum (eu.l.), lactobacillus casei (l.c.), and lactobacillus fermentum (l.f.). our results indicate that gram-positive cw of the normal intestinal microbiota can induce cytokine responses of the human pbmc. the profile, level and kinetics of these responses are similar to those induced by lipopolysaccharide (lps) or cw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (s.p.). bacterial cw are capable of inducing production of a proinflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, il-10, but not that of il-4 or interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma). monocytes  are the main cell population in pbmc to produce tnf-alpha and il-10. induction of cytokine secretion is serum-dependent; both cd14-dependent and -independent pathways are involved. these findings suggest that the human cytokine responses induced by gram-positive cw of the normal intestinal microbiota are similar to those induced by lps or gram-positive cw of the pathogens.

TI  == efficient secretion of the model antigen m6-gp41e in lactobacillus plantarum ncimb 8826.
AB  == four lactobacillus strains (lb. plantarum ncimb 8826, lb. paracasei lbtgs1.4, lb. casei atcc 393 and lb. fermentum kld) were tested for their ability to produce and secrete heterologous proteins. these strains were first screened with an alpha-amylase reporter under the control of a set of expression or expression/secretion signals from various lactic acid bacteria. with most of the  constructions tested, the level of extracellular production was highest in lb. plantarum ncimb 8826, and lowest in lb. paracasei lbtgs1.4. these two strains were next assayed using a model antigen consisting of the n-terminal part of the  m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes fused to the linear epitope eldkwas from human immunodeficiency virus gp41 protein. secretion of this heterologous protein was inefficient in lb. paracasei lbtgs1.4, which accumulated a large intracellular pool of the unprocessed precursor, whereas lb. plantarum ncimb 8826 was able to secrete the antigen to a level as high as 10 mg l-1.

TI  == cell wall anchoring of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

TI  == the binding of pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid to human erythrocytes.
AB  == previous studies have evaluated the binding characteristics of lipoteichoic acids (lta) composed of polyglycerol phosphate to mammalian cell membranes. this present study was performed to evaluate the binding characteristics of pneumococcal lta, a polyribitol phosphate containing lta, to human erythrocytes.  binding was found to be specific, reversible, and dependent on temperature and time. maximum binding was achieved within 2 h at 37 degrees c. scatchard plot analysis of the binding revealed a biphasic plot which suggests two receptor sites with different affinities. competitive inhibition studies with lta composed of polyglycerol phosphate and isolated from streptococcus pyogenes and lactobacillus fermentum revealed significant inhibition of pneumococcal lta-binding to the erythrocyte membrane by these heterologous ltas. these results demonstrate that pneumococcal lta binds specifically to human erythrocytes and that the receptor site is similar for other structurally different ltas.

TI  == the ability to sensitize host cells for destruction by autologous complement is a general property of lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that lipoteichoic acid (lta) from streptococcus pneumoniae binds to erythrocytes and renders them susceptible to lysis by autologous complement. the present study was performed to determine whether lta from two other gram-positive bacterial species had the ability to render mammalian cells susceptible to lysis by autologous complement. human erythrocytes were sensitized with lta from s. pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, or lactobacillus fermentum. under incubation in normal autologous serum, lysis was observed with each of the lta-sensitized erythrocyte preparations. when erythrocytes from a c2-deficient patient were sensitized with the lta preparations and then incubated in autologous, c2-deficient serum, the erythrocytes sensitized with s. pyogenes or l. fermentum lta demonstrated relatively little lysis, whereas the erythrocytes sensitized with s. pneumoniae lta yielded near-total lysis. after reconstitution of the c2-deficient serum with purified human c2, lysis was observed with all three lta preparations. when erythrocytes from an agammaglobulinemic patient were sensitized with either the s. pyogenes or the l. fermentum lta, they were not lysed in the presence of autologous agammaglobulinemic serum, whereas the erythrocytes sensitized with s.  pneumoniae lta were completely lysed. serum obtained from the agammaglobulinemic  patient after reconstitution with intravenous pooled gamma globulin was able to lyse autologous erythrocytes sensitized with each of the three lta preparations.  these results demonstrate that the ability to render host cells susceptible to lysis by autologous complement is a general property of lta. whether activation of the autologous complement occurs by the classical or alternative pathways and  whether it is antibody dependent depends on the nature of the bacterial lta.
