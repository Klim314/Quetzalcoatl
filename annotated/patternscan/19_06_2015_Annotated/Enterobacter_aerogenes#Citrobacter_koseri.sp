TI  == intraoperative vancomycin use in spinal surgery: single institution experience and microbial trends.
AB  == study design: retrospective case series. objective: to demonstrate the microbial  trends of spinal surgical site infections in patients who had previously received crystallized vancomycin in the operative bed. summary of background data: prior large, case control series demonstrate the significant decrease in surgical site  infection with the administration of vancomycin in the wound bed. methods: a single institution, electronic database search was conducted for all patients who underwent spinal surgery who had received prophylactic crystalline vancomycin powder in the wound bed. patients with a prior history of wound infection, intrathecal pumps, or spinal stimulators were excluded. results: a total of 981 consecutive patients (494 males, 487 females; mean age, 59.4 yr; range, 16-95 yr) were identified from january 2011 to june 2013. the average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.13 g (range, 1-6 g). sixty-six patients (6.71%) were diagnosed with  a surgical site infection, of which 51 patients had positive wound cultures (5.2%). of the 51 positive cultures, the most common organism was staphylococcus  aureus. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.3 g in the 38 cases where a gram-positive organism was cultured. a number of gram-negative infections were encountered such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.2 g in 23 cases where a gram-negative infection was cultured. fifteen of the 51 positive cultures (29.4%) were polymicrobial. eight (53%) of these 15 polymicrobial cultures contained 3 or more distinct organisms. conclusion: prophylactic intraoperative vancomycin use in the wound bed in spinal surgery may increase the incidence of gram-negative or polymicrobial spinal infections. the use of intraoperative vancomycin may correlate with postoperative seromas, due to the high incidence of nonpositive cultures. large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to demonstrate causation and dose-response relationship.

TI  == identification of enterobacteriaceae by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the vitek ms system.
AB  == this multicenter study evaluated the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry identifications from the vitek ms system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) for enterobacteriaceae typically encountered in the clinical laboratory. enterobacteriaceae isolates (n = 965) representing 17 genera and 40 species were  analyzed on the vitek ms system (database v2.0), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. colony growth (</=72 h) was applied directly to the  target slide. matrix solution (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added and  allowed to dry before mass spectrometry analysis. on the basis of the confidence  level, the vitek ms system provided a species, genus only, or no identification for each isolate. the accuracy of the mass spectrometric identification was compared to 16s rrna gene sequencing performed at midi labs (newark, de). supplemental phenotypic testing was performed at biomerieux when necessary. the vitek ms result agreed with the reference method identification for 96.7% of the  965 isolates tested, with 83.8% correct to the species level and 12.8% limited to a genus-level identification. there was no identification for 1.7% of the isolates. the vitek ms system misidentified 7 isolates (0.7 %) as different genera. three pantoea agglomerans isolates were misidentified as enterobacter spp. and single isolates of enterobacter cancerogenus, escherichia hermannii, hafnia alvei, and raoultella ornithinolytica were misidentified as klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, obesumbacterium proteus, and enterobacter aerogenes, respectively. eight isolates (0.8 %) were misidentified as a different species in the correct genus. the vitek ms system provides reliable mass spectrometric identifications for enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in lebanese patients.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. we conducted a study of 32 lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. the presence or absence of s aureus enterotoxin a, b, c, and d (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. a total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. of these, only 3 (8.8%) were s aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin b). moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. our results could not confirm that s aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the lebanese group studied.

TI  == genetic structure and distribution of the colibactin genomic island among members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a genomic island encoding the biosynthesis and secretion pathway of putative hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide colibactin has been recently described in  escherichia coli. colibactin acts as a cyclomodulin and blocks the eukaryotic cell cycle. the origin and prevalence of the colibactin island among enterobacteria are unknown. we therefore screened 1,565 isolates of different genera and species related to the enterobacteriaceae by pcr for the presence of this dna element. the island was detected not only in e. coli but also in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter koseri isolates. it was highly conserved among these species and was always associated with the yersiniabactin determinant. structural variations between individual strains were only observed in an intergenic region containing variable numbers of tandem repeats. in e. coli, the colibactin island was usually restricted to isolates of  phylogenetic group b2 and inserted at the asnw trna locus. interestingly, in k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, c. koseri, and three e. coli strains of phylogenetic group b1, the functional colibactin determinant was associated with a genetic element similar to the integrative and conjugative elements iceec1 and icekp1 and to several enterobacterial plasmids. different asn trna genes served as chromosomal insertion sites of the ice-associated colibactin determinant: asnu in the three e. coli strains of ecor group b1, and different asn trna loci in k. pneumoniae. the detection of the colibactin genes associated with an ice-like element in several enterobacteria provides new insights into the spread of this gene cluster and its putative mode of transfer. our results shed light on the mechanisms of genetic exchange between members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == ft-ir microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of enterobacteriaceae isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in a french hospital.
AB  == in 2002, 80 isolates of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were collected from infected patients in our hospital. enterobacter aerogenes was the most common bacterium isolated from all specimens  (36.5%). the esbls were predominantly (90%) tem derivatives (tem-24, tem-3). pulsed-field gel electrophoresis highlighted that e. aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and citrobacter koseri had a clonal propagation.

TI  == frequency and diversity of class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in hospitals of the auvergne, france: a 2 year prospective study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the frequency and diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) produced by enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in one french region. methods: during 2001-2002, all the non-duplicate isolates of p. aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime and of enterobacteriaceae intermediate  or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime and/or aminoglycosides with an aac(6') i phenotype were collected in nine hospitals of the area. esbl isoelectric points were determined, bla genes were amplified and sequenced and epidemic isolates were genotyped with eric2-pcr. results: esbls were observed in  297 enterobacteriaceae (0.8%). the most frequent were tem-3 like (n=152; 51.2%) and tem-24 (n=115; 38.7%). four new enzymes were observed, tem-112 (pi 5.4), tem-113 (pi 6.3), tem-114 (pi 5.9) and tem-126 (pi 5.4). other tems were tem-8, tem-12, tem-16, tem-19, tem-20, tem-21, tem-29 and tem-71. the other esbls were shv-4, shv-5 and shv-12, ctx-m-1, ctx-m-3, ctx-m-14 and ctx-m-15. in 37 p. aeruginosa (0.7%) only one esbl was observed, per-1. five epidemic strains were detected, serratia marcescens tem-3 and four observed in several hospitals, enterobacter aerogenes tem-24, citrobacter koseri tem-3, proteus mirabilis tem-3  and p. aeruginosa per-1. conclusion: esbl frequency was lower than in 1998, and ctx-m-type frequency higher (2.1% of esbls in 2001, 4.9% in 2002). this long-term survey detected new sporadic enzymes (tem-112, tem-113, tem-114 and tem-126) and  interhospital epidemic strains while avoiding any overestimation of esbl frequency that may otherwise have occurred because of acute epidemics.

TI  == yersiniabactin and other siderophores produced by clinical isolates of enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp.
AB  == we analyzed the ability of extraintestinal strains of enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. to employ different siderophore-mediated strategies of iron acquisition. all strains produced iron-chelating compounds. cross-feeding assays  indicated that most isolates of both enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. excreted catecholate siderophore enterobactin, less produced aerobactin, and single strains excreted hydroxamates different from aerobactin. besides, we analyzed if the strains had the ability to produce the siderophore yersiniabactin coded by the yersinia high-pathogenicity island (hpi). the presence of hpi genes  was observed in single isolates of three species: e. cloaceae, e. aerogenes and c. koseri. a detailed polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed differences in  the genetic organization of the hpis; however, in a cross-feeding test we proved  that yersiniabactin was produced and the island was functional.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == the effects of plant phenolics, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid on arylamine n-acetyltransferase activities in human gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the possible effects of naturally occurring plant phenolics, caffeic acid (ca), chlorogenic acid (cga) and ferulic acid (fa) on arylamine n-acetyltransferase (nat) activities on human gastrointestinal microflora, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter koseri and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined. the bacterial nat activities were determined by hplc measuring the acetylation of 2-aminofluorene (2-af). among all examined bacteria, p. aeruginosa exerted the highest nat activity while c. koseri possessed the lowest nat activity. ca, cga and fa could suppress the bacterial nat activities dose-dependently both in the intact cell and cytosolic fraction analysis. according to the analysis of kinetic parameters in e. coli and p. aeruginosa, ca, cga and fa were shown to be potent noncompetitive inhibitors of bacterial nat activities. for the time course experiment, 4 mm of ca and fa could inhibit bacterial nat activities for at least 4 hour but 4 mm of cga could only significantly suppress nat activity in e. coli for the same reaction time. these  results strongly demonstrated that ca, cga and fa inhibited nat activities in human gastrointestinal bacteria.

TI  == infectious crystalline keratopathy caused by gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == purpose: to identify the characteristics and outcomes of infectious crystalline keratopathy caused by gram-negative bacteria. methods: we reviewed all patients treated at a university eye center for infectious crystalline keratopathy from 1978 through 1995 and performed a nested case-comparison study by comparing patients with keratitis caused by gram-negative rods and those with keratitis caused by gram-positive cocci. results: eighteen patients (mean age +/- sd, 59 +/- 17 years) displayed unilateral culture-positive infectious crystalline keratopathy. among 18 eyes with crystalline keratopathy, five occurrences (28%) were caused by gram-negative rods (acinetobacter lwoffi, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia), 10 (55%) were caused primarily by gram-positive cocci, and three (17%) were caused primarily by yeasts. four cases grew two different isolates. no significant difference in predisposing factors, clinical appearance, or visual outcome was found between infections caused by gram-negative bacteria and those caused by gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: gram-negative bacteria can cause infectious crystalline keratopathy but have no distinguishing features from infectious crystalline keratopathy caused by streptococci and other gram-positive bacteria. appropriate laboratory evaluation is therefore necessary to guide specific antimicrobial therapy.

AB  == a total of 1,123 strains representing 128 taxa in the enterobacteriaceae (named species or subspecies and genomic species) were screened for the presence of glycerol dehydrogenases and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. only eight taxa, citrobacter freundii sensu stricto, c. youngae, c. braakii, c. werkmanii, citrobacter genomospecies 10 and 11, enterobacter gergoviae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae could grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed  both glycerol dehydrogenase type i (induced by glycerol and dihydroxyacetone) and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase which are typical enzymes of the anaerobic glycerol dissimilation pathway. six other species, c. koseri, e. aerogenes, e. intermedium, k. oxytoca, k. planticola and k. terrigena could not grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed a glycerol dehydrogenase type i but no 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. other glycerol dehydrogenases types were found: type ii (induced by glycerol and hydroxyacetone), type iii (induced by glycerol only) and type iv (induced by hydroxyacetone only). they were widely distributed  among the enterobacteriaceae. classification and identification may take advantage of tests exploring the dissimilation of glycerol.
