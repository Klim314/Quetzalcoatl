TI  - Catalase-positive cocci in fermented sausage: Variability due to different pork breeds, breeding systems and sausage production technology.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the ecology of catalase-positive cocci (CPC) present in traditional fermented sausages produced using different breeds of pork, each of which was raised in two different environments and processed using two different technologies. Semi-quantitative molecular methods were used to determine bacterial identities. Almost all fermentations were characterised by a significant increase in CPC during the first few days of fermentation, reaching values of 10(5)-10(6) cfu g(-1) within 3 days. Staphylococcus xylosus and Staphylococcus equorum species, which were detected over the course of fermentation, were found to be the predominant population in all the monitored fermentation. Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lentus, Micrococcus luteus, Macrococcus caseolyticus and Staphylococcus succinus were also present, but their concentrations were found to vary under the different experimental conditions. Using cluster analysis, we concluded that a plant-specific CPC ecology existed. In addition, the breed of pork used for production was found to influence the presence of some CPC species. However, from this study, it was not possible to reach the same conclusion regarding the breeding system used.
TI  - Combining denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rDNA V3 region and 16S-23S rDNA spacer region polymorphism analyses for the identification of staphylococci from Italian fermented sausages.
AB  - Separation of amplified V3 region from 16S rDNA by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region polymorphism (ISR-PCR) analyses were tested as tool for differentiation of staphylococcal strains commonly isolated from fermented sausages. Variable V3 regions of 25 staphylococcal reference strains and 96 wild strains of species belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Micrococcus and Kocuria were analyzed. PCR-DGGE profiles obtained were species-specific for S. sciuri, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. auricularis, S. condimenti, S. kloosi, S. vitulus, S. succinus, S. pasteuri, S. capitis and S. (Macrococcus) caseolyticus. Moreover, 7 groups could be distinguished gathering the remaining species as result of the separation of the V3 rDNA amplicons in DGGE. Furthermore, the combination of the results obtained by PCR-DGGE and ISR-PCR analyses allowed a clear differentiation of all the staphylococcal species analysed, with exception of the pairs S. equorum-S. cohnii and S. carnosus-S. schleiferi. The suitability of both molecular techniques and of the combination their results for the identification of staphylococci was validated analysing partial nucleotide sequence of the 16S rDNA of a representative number of wild strains.
