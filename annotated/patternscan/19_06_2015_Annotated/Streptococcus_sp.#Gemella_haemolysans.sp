TI  == [gemella haemolysans brain abscess in a child with complex congenital heart disease].
AB  == gemella haemolysans, a gram positive cocci which are deemed to be the normal inhabitant of the mucous membranes of the oropharynx, has been recognized as a pathogen involved in abscess formation. the aim of this case report is to demonstrate that it is also involved in brain abscess in children. we report, to  our knowledge, the first pediatric case of gemella haemolysans brain abscess in an 11 years old child carrying a complex congenital heart disease (dextrocardia with single right ventricle) which evolved favorably under antibiotic therapy. because of its similarity with streptococcus viridans groupe, gemella haemolysans often remains under-diagnosed in the laboratory. the contribution of microbiologists in its correct identification is very important.

TI  == the predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  == purpose: to detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. material and methods: clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. cultures were made from clinical  materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. results: the following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: streptococcus milleri group (smg) (23.8%) [streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), streptococcus mitis (4.7%), streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), prevotella buccae (4.7%), prevotella intermedia (4.7%), actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), rothia denticariosa (4.7%), gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). conclusions: results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. it was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. although no  specific microorganism was found, streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially smg (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == [endocarditis caused by rare gram-positive bacteria: investigate for gastrointestinal disorders].
AB  == gemella haemolysans, streptococcus equinus and tropheryma whipplei are rare gram-positive bacteria which may cause endocarditis and are associated with gastrointestinal disorders. we report on three patients with infective endocarditis caused by these microorganisms. g. haemolysans and s. equinus (streptococcus bovis group) were isolated from blood cultures, and t. whipplei was diagnosed by molecular typing of an excised heart valve. the association between endocarditis caused by these microorganisms and gastrointestinal disorders warranted further examination. endoscopic examination revealed a colonic carcinoma in the patient with g. haemolysans endocarditis and diverticulosis in the patient with s. equinus endocarditis. no gastrointestinal tract disorders were found in the patient with t. whipplei endocarditis, but this does not exclude whipple's disease. examination of the gastrointestinal tract for a focus of infection should be considered in patients with endocarditis caused by g. haemolysans, s. equinus and t. whipplei if no other source of bacteraemia is apparent.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == a multicentre prospective study of post-traumatic endophthalmitis.
AB  == purpose: study the clinical and microbiological characteristics and the prognostic factors of post-traumatic endophthalmitis. methods: seventeen eyes were included between 2004 and 2010, with clinical and microbiological data collected prospectively. conventional cultures and panbacterial pcr were performed on aqueous and vitreous samples. results: clinical signs of endophthalmitis were observed soon after trauma (1.5 +/- 2.5 days). laceration with an intraocular foreign body (iofb) was noted in 53% of the patients. at admission, all patients had aqueous humour (71%) and/or vitreous (53%) samples. fifteen patients (88%) underwent a pars plana vitrectomy. bacteria were identified in 77% of the cases: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), streptococcus (n = 4), bacillus (n = 2), pseudomonas stuzeri (n = 1), and streptococcus salivarius and gemella haemolysans (multibacterial infection, n = 1). progression toward phthisis was observed in 35% of the cases; 41% of the patients recuperated visual acuity (va) >/=20/40. a good final visual prognosis (>/=20/40) was significantly associated with initial va better than light perception (0% versus  70%, p = 0.01) and absence of pupillary fibrin membrane (80% versus 20%, p = 0.05). there was no correlation between visual prognosis and age, the type of laceration (corneal or scleral) or presence of an iofb. we found a statistical trend toward an association between bacterial virulence and poor final va. conclusion: this series showed that better final va outcomes were associated with initial va better than light perception, s. epidermidis or culture-negative cases and absence of retinal detachment during the clinical course.

TI  == the subgingival microbiota of papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of children and adolescents receiving orthodontic treatment.
AB  == purpose: this case-controlled study examined clinical and microbiological parameters in brazilian children and adolescents receiving orthodontic treatment  using fixed orthodontic appliances or removable orthodontic appliances. methods:  the plaque index, gingival index, number of decayed, missing and filled teeth, and probing pocket depth was measured on each fully erupted tooth in 30 patients  treated with fixed orthodontic appliances and an equal number of age and sex-matched control subjects. the same parameters were also measured in 18 patients treated with removable orthodontic appliances and an equal number of age and sex-matched control subjects. in the patients treated with fixed orthodontic  appliances, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four teeth with orthodontic brackets and from four teeth with orthodontic bands. in the patients  with removable appliances, subgingival plaque samples were collected from clasped maxillary permanent first molar teeth and from four unclasped permanent teeth. samples of unstimulated whole saliva and samples from the dorsal surface of the tongue were also obtained from each subject. each sample was analyzed for the presence of 19 target bacteria by dot blot. a subset of samples was examined by direct amplification of bacterial nucleic acids. results: compared to their respective age and sex-matched controls, whole mouth means for plaque index and gingival index were significantly elevated in both the fixed and removable orthodontic groups. there was no difference in the dmft. subjects with fixed orthodontic appliances had a higher prevalence of each of the target species except for l. fermentum, neisseriaceae and s. mutans. the prevalence of a. naeslundii and streptococcus sp. was significantly higher on teeth with orthodontic brackets alone compared to teeth with both orthodontic bands and brackets. subjects with removable orthodontic appliances had a higher prevalence  of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, l. fermentum, neisseriaceae, and spirochetes. the prevalence of neisseriaceae was significantly higher on unclasped teeth compared to clasped teeth. there was no difference between sample sites for the target bacteria except for a. actinomycetemcomitans  that was detected less frequently in saliva. orthodontic patients demonstrated higher proportions of gram negative species by direct amplification of nucleic acids including species frequently associated with periodontal disease as well as rarely cultivable or non-cultivable species such as abiotrophia defectiva, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lautropia sp., terrahaemophilus aromaticivorans, and tm7 bacterium.

TI  == molecular methodology to assess the impact of cancer chemotherapy on the oral bacterial flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objective: this pilot study determined the profile of the oral bacterial flora in an outpatient cancer population before and after chemotherapy using molecular techniques. study design: we recruited 9 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients scheduled for induction chemotherapy. all were seen immediately before chemotherapy, and 7 to 14 days later. at both visits, we performed oral evaluations and obtained mucositis grading (with the world health organization [who] scale), absolute neutrophil counts (anc), and bacterial samples from the buccal mucosa. bacterial dna was isolated, and 16s ribosomal rna gene clonal libraries were constructed. sequences of genes in the library were used to determine species identity by comparison to known sequences. results: after chemotherapy, who scores of 0 and 1 were in 3 and 6 patients, respectively, and mean anc (+/-sd) dropped from 3326 +/- 463 to 1091 +/- 1082 cells/mm(3). from pre- and post-chemotherapy samples, 41 species were detected, with a predominance of gemella haemolysans and streptococcus mitis. more than 85% of species have not been previously identified in chemotherapy patients. seven species appeared exclusively before chemotherapy and 25 after chemotherapy. after chemotherapy, the number of species per patient increased by a mean of 2.6 (sd = 4.7, p = .052). conclusion: we identified species not previously identified in chemotherapy patients. our results suggest a shift to a more complex oral bacterial profile in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aphthous ulcers.
AB  == introduction: recurrent aphthous ulcers are common lesions of the oral mucosa of  which the etiology is unknown. this study aimed to estimate the bacterial diversity in the lesions and in control mucosa in pooled samples using a culture-independent molecular approach. methods: samples were collected from ten  healthy individuals and ten individuals with a clinical history of recurrent aphthous ulcers. after dna extraction, the 16s ribosomal rna bacterial gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with universal primers; amplicons were cloned, sequenced and matched to the genbank database. results: a total of 535 clones were analyzed, defining 95 bacterial species. we identified 62 putative novel phylotypes. in recurrent aphthous ulcer lesions 57 phylotypes were detected, of which 11 were known species. control samples had 38 phylotypes, five of which were already known. only three species or phylotypes were abundant and common to both groups (gemella haemolysans, streptococcus mitis strain 209 and streptococcus pneumoniae r6). one genus was found only in recurrent aphthous ulcer samples (prevotella) corresponding to 16% of all lesion-derived clones. conclusion: the microbiota found in recurrent aphthous ulcers and in the control  groups diverged markedly and the rich variety of genera found can provide a new starting point for individual qualitative and quantitative analyses of bacteria associated with this oral condition.

TI  == horizontal transfer of the immunoglobulin a1 protease gene (iga) from streptococcus to gemella haemolysans.
AB  == bacterial iga1 proteases share the ability to cleave human iga1 at the hinge region. nature has developed this trait along at least five independent evolutionary lineages. to obtain further insight into the phylogeny and function  of iga1 proteases, the nucleotide sequence of the iga gene that encodes the iga1  protease was determined from two streptococcus mitis strains and one gemella haemolysans strain. heterologous expression in escherichia coli confirmed that the genes encode human iga1-cleaving activity. iga1 proteases from streptococcus  and g. haemolysans shared structural features, including a motif typical for zinc-dependent metalloproteases of clan ma(e) family m26 and an n-terminal signal sequence followed by an lpxtg cell-wall-anchor motif and two putative membrane-spanning domains. in addition, they all harboured a repeat region preceding the active site of the protease. in the streptococcal iga1 proteases, a g5 domain, which has been suggested to bind n-acetylglucosamine, was identified.  conservation of these structures in otherwise diverse proteases suggests that they are essential to the biological function of the enzyme. the phylogenetic distribution of homologous iga genes and conservation of gene order in the iga gene region in different streptococcus species, combined with the sequence homologies, strongly suggest that the iga gene is more ancient in streptococcus than in g. haemolysans, and therefore that the iga1 protease gene was transferred from streptococcus to g. haemolysans.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == [acute gemella haemolysans spondylodiscitis in an immunocompetent patient].
AB  == introduction: gemella is a commensal bacterium of the upper respiratory tract responsible for rare infections such as acute endocarditis and meningitis. we report the case of an acute gemella haemolysans spondylodiscitis. observation: a  72 year-old woman was hospitalised for an etiological control and treatment of acute l4-l5 spondylodiscitis with epiduritis, confirmed on mri. the clinical picture was composed of backache with shivering and alteration in general status  of health. the peripheral bacteriological samples, intra-dermal reaction and brucella serology were all negative. the surgical l5 biopsy, following bacteriological enrichment, isolated gram-positive cocci, later identified as gemella haemolysans. the antibiogram showed good sensitivity to amoxicillin, dalacin and erythromycin, and strong resistance to aminosides. the search for a contamination point was negative. the patient rapidly improved with antibiotics combining 6 g/d of amoxicillin and 1200 mg/d of clindamycin, and the biological and clinical signs regressed. the antibiotic bi-therapy was continued for two and a half months and then relayed to amoxicillin alone for two further weeks. comments: the first descriptions of gemella haemolysans infection were made in the seventies. cases of infectious endocarditis were succeeded by septicaemia on  cirrhosis and later a few cases of acute post-neurosurgical meningitis. in the majority of cases, a dental contamination point was found. the difficulties in its etiological diagnosis, related to the problems in identifying this germ that  has similar characteristics to streptococcus viridans, suggests that the prevalence of gemella haemolysans infections is greatly underrated. the sensitivity profile generally observed is sensitivity to penicillins and aminosides--the association of which is synergic--, to cyclines and glycopeptides, and resistance to trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole.

TI  == gemella bacteraemia characterised by 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == aims: to define epidemiology, clinical disease, and outcome of gemella bacteraemia by 16s rrna gene sequencing. to examine the usefulness of the vitek,  api, and atb systems in identifying two gemella species. methods: all alpha haemolytic streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from blood cultures during a six year period were identified by conventional biochemical methods, the vitek system, and the api system. 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed on all isolates identified by both kits as gemella with >or= 95% confidence or by either kit as any bacterial species with < 95% confidence. the atb expression system was used to identify the two isolates that were defined as  gemella species by 16s rrna gene sequencing. results: of the 302 alpha haemolytic streptococci other than s pneumoniae isolated, one was identified as gemella morbillorum, and another as gemella haemolysans by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the  patient with monomicrobial g morbillorum bacteraemia was a 66 year old man with community acquired infective endocarditis with septic thromboemboli. the patient  with g haemolysans bacteraemia was a 41 year old woman with hospital acquired polymicrobial bacteraemia during the neutropenic period of an autologous bone marrow transplant for non-hodgkin's lymphoma, the first case of its kind in the english literature. the api and atb expression systems only identified the second strain as g haemolysans at 94% and 99% confidence, respectively, whereas the vitek system identified none of the two strains correctly at > 70% confidence. conclusions: gemella bacteraemia is uncommon. 16s rrna gene sequencing is the method of choice for identification of gemella and gemella-like isolates.

TI  == immunoglobulin a1 protease activity in gemella haemolysans.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence and nature of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease activity in members of the genus gemella and related taxa. among a total of 22 gemella strains belonging to the four species gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, gemella sanguinis, and gemella bergeriae and four reference strains of the species helcococcus kunzii, facklamia hominis, and globicatella sanguinis, iga1 protease activity was an exclusive character of all nine isolates of g. haemolysans. the iga1 protease of g. haemolysans appears to be a metallo-type iga1 protease that cleaves the pro(227)-thr(228) peptide bond in the hinge region of the alpha1 chain like that  of several streptococcus species. phenotypic characterization of the isolates demonstrates that screening for iga1 protease activity provides a valuable means  for species differentiation in this group of bacteria.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

TI  == in vivo binding of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp (identical to gcdfp-15) to oral and non-oral bacteria detection and identification of ep-gp binding species.
AB  == extra parotid glycoprotein (ep-gp) is a glycoprotein isolated from human saliva,  having homologues in several other body fluids. the biological role of ep-gp and  its homologues is unknown. recently, ep-gp was shown to bind in vitro to the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb. in contrast, no binding to a number of other oral microorganisms could be demonstrated. in the present study we have determined whether binding of ep-gp to bacteria occurs in vivo in saliva and in other ep-gp containing body fluids. therefore the presence of ep-gp on bacteria in vivo was determined by analyzing oral, skin and ear floras by confocal fluoresence microscopy using specific antibodies. about 12% of the in vivo oral flora had ep-gp present on their surface, while approximately 5% of the bacteria  from ear canal or skin was positive for ep-gp. iga was detected on approximately  65% of the salivary bacteria, whereas the high-molecular weight mucin (mg1) and cystatin c were not detectable on any oral bacterium. using a replica-plate assay, a number of ep-gp binding strains in saliva were isolated and identified as gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorium, streptococcus acidominimus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus parasanguis. bacteria from the ear canal and skin bacteria were identified as staphylococcus hominis. it is concluded that ep-gp is selectively bound in vivo to several oral  and non-oral bacterial species.

AB  == phosphorylcholine (pc)-containing antigens were sought in 269 bacterial isolates  from the mouth and respiratory tract by an enzyme immunoassay method. only 41 (15%) isolates were pc-positive and of these 29 (70%) were strains of haemophilus influenzae. other species that produced positive results included two of five isolates of gemella haemolysans, two of five isolates of micrococcus spp., and a  single strain each of bacillus sp., corynebacterium jeikeium, lactococcus sp. and h. parainfluenzae. the presence of pc-containing antigens in h. influenzae may be an important source of cross-reaction in antigen detection techniques that detect the c-polysaccharide antigen of streptococcus pneumoniae in respiratory specimens and would result in false positive results.

TI  == gram-positive cocci isolated from slaughtered poultry.
AB  == gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) cfu/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) cfu/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) cfu/ml for 75% of the samples. the 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), e. faecium (16), e. avium (7), e. durans (4), aerococcus viridans (10), streptococcus morbillorum (2), s. salivarius (1), s. sanguis (1), s. "milleri" (1), s. pneumoniae (1), s. acidominimus (1), and gemella haemolysans (1). these species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). a count of the gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.

TI  == phylogenetic relationship of gemella morbillorum to gemella haemolysans.
AB  == partial 16s rrna gene sequences (16s rdna) of gemella morbillorum and gemella haemolysans were determined by sequencing polymerase chain reaction-amplified dna. a phylogenetic analysis of 53 eubacterial 16s rrna sequences grouped the gemellae on a distinct branch separate from the 18 members of the genus streptococcus. dna-dna hybridization results indicate that the two gemellae are related at the genus level but are not a single species.

TI  == endovascular infection and septic arthritis caused by gemella morbillorum.
AB  == streptococcus morbillorum was transferred to the genus gemella in 1988. infections caused by g. morbillorum are unusual. we report a case of endovascular infection and presumptive septic arthritis caused by g. morbillorum. previous cases of infection caused by g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans are reviewed.

TI  == endocarditis caused by gemella haemolysans.
AB  == gemella haemolysans, a coccus related to the "streptococcaceae", was isolated from the blood of a patient with endocarditis. the patient was successfully treated with a combination of penicillin g and tobramycin, followed by clindamycin. the taxonomy of this organism, especially its relationship to "streptococcus morbillorum" is discussed and previously reported cases of gemella infections are reviewed.

TI  == the growth of oral bacteria on saliva.
AB  == the present experiments were aimed at studying the degradation of salivary glycoproteins by the oral microflora. to this end, s. sanguis i strain ny476 and  s. sanguis ii (s. mitior) strain ny581 were grown continuously in human-whole saliva. under these conditions, the strains produced a variety of cell-associated hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases, exo- and endopeptidases, and esterases. s. sanguis ii generally exhibited higher levels of enzyme activity than did s. sanguis i, in particular of neuraminidase that was produced only by s. sanguis ii. in accordance, s. sanguis ii had a higher cell yield and consumed  a higher proportion of the sugars and sialic acid in the glycoproteins than did s. sanguis i. interestingly, s. sanguis i, which is devoid of neuraminidase, is known to have a lectin with specificity for sialic acid, whereas s. sanguis ii has affinity for galactose residues in the glycoproteins. we propose that specific binding of glycoproteins by oral bacteria constitutes a mechanism to collect nutrients in the vicinity of the cell. the special ability of s. sanguis  ii to utilize saliva for growth was further exemplified by its selection in batch-wise enrichments of dental plaque on saliva. the microflora in these enrichment cultures always consisted of peptostreptococcus micros, s. sanguis ii, and fusobacterium nucleatum as the dominant organisms. further, s. mitis and gemella haemolysans were generally found to be present. the enrichment cultures produced a wide variety of mainly cell-bound hydrolytic enzymes. this resulted in almost complete breakdown of salivary glycoproteins in the culture.

TI  == differentiation of gemella haemolysans (thjotta and boe 1938) berger 1960, from streptococcus morbillorum (prevot 1933) holdeman and moore 1974.
AB  == recently, g. haemolysans and s. morbillorum were postulated to be identical organisms, so that consequently their names were synonyms. in the present paper it was demonstrated, that, in spite of many similarities, both species can be differentiated by nitrite reduction, lacking in s. morbillorum, and some further  enzymatic activities as well as by antigenic specificity and certain dissimilarities in morphology, growth conditions and their ability to induce beta-hemolysis. s. morbillorum apparently represents a group of strains with divergent properties and might be assigned to the genus gemella rather than to streptococcus.

TI  == effects of dietary chlortetracycline on the antimicrobial resistance of porcine faecal streptococcaceae.
AB  == breeding pigs and one-half of their progeny were fed antimicrobial-free rations;  the other half of the progeny received rations supplemented with 100 g of chlortetracycline (ctc)/ton. effects of dietary ctc with respect to the distribution of species and biotypes of faecal gram-positive cocci and their relative resistance to 12 antimicrobial agents were studied. diversity of antimicrobial resistance (amr) patterns and modal amr patterns were determined for bacterial species common to all three groups. numerical taxonomic analysis placed 1140 of 1150 isolates (99%) into 10 groups. three of these were biotypes of streptococcus faecium and contained the largest number of isolates (n = 934, 81%). streptococcus faecalis, strep. morbillorum, pediococcus halophilus and gemella haemolysans also were isolated. generally, the proportion of tetracycline-resistant strains for a species or biotype was greater from pigs fed ctc, although differences were not significant (p greater than 0.05). there was a significant difference (p less than 0.05) among all the groups for the percentage of penicillin-resistant strains in a biotype of strep. faecium. overall, 57 and 43 different amr patterns, including 2 to 11 and 1 to 11 resistance determinants, were demonstrated in isolates from control pigs and pigs fed ctc, respectively. modal amr patterns in species and biotypes were the same from both progeny groups, except for strep. faecium. amr pattern diversity was decreased for strains from pigs fed ctc. similar proportions of resistant strains from each group of progeny pigs were accompanied by decreased amr pattern diversity in strains from pigs fed ctc. these results indicated a change in distribution of amr phenotypical patterns, rather than a change in overall frequency of individual resistant phenotypes.
