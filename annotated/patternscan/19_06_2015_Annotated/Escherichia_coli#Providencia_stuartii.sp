TI  == characterization of multiple ndm-1-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates from the same patient.
AB  == a male patient was admitted to a community hospital in ontario, canada, with an infected sacral ulcer after returning from india, where he was hospitalized. carbapenem-resistant escherichia coli (isolated from blood cultures), enterobacter cloacae, and providencia stuartii (from urine samples), all positive for blandm-1, were recovered. comparative ndm-1 plasmid analysis suggests both lateral plasmid transfer and independent acquisition of the blandm-1 gene in these clinical isolates.

TI  == evaluation of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in an italian setting: report from the trench.
AB  == the spread of carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) has recently become a matter of concern in public health, mainly due to the wide distribution of carbapenemase genes. italy is a country considered endemic for the spread of blakpc klebsiella pneumoniae (kp). the aim of this study was to depict the epidemiological trend of cre in one italian hospital over a long period (3 years  surveillance, from may 2011 to april 2014). based on defined mic cut-off for specific carbapenems, 164 strains isolated from 146 different patients were analyzed both phenotypically and genotypically to establish the resistance genes. molecular typing was performed using the rapd technique. 77 strains were demonstrated to harbor the blakpc gene (73 kp, 4 escherichia coli - ec), 51 strains the blavim gene (44 kp, 3 ec, 2 enterobacter cloacae and 2 klebsiella oxytoca), 8 the blandm gene (3 kp, 4 ec and one providencia stuartii), 3 the blaoxa-48 gene (2 kp, 1 ec), whereas 25 out of the 164 isolates (of different genera and species) had a negative multiplex-pcr amplification for all the targets tested. 39 out of the 164 strains analyzed (23.8%) revealed discrepancies between the mics obtained with automated instrument and gradient mics of more than two logs of difference; the broth microdilution provided a better agreement  with the results obtained with the gradient mic. the use of rapd allowed to distinguish different clusters, closely related, both for blakpc and for blavim kp.

TI  == nosocomial dissemination of plasmids carrying blatem-24, bladha-1, aac(6')-ib-cr, and qnra6 in providencia spp. strains isolated from a tunisian hospital.
AB  == the aim of this study is to report the emergence of inca/c conjugative plasmids harboring blatem-24, bladha-1, qnra6, and aac(6')-ib-cr genes among providencia spp. isolates recovered in 2008 in tunisia. the double-disk synergy test confirmed the phenotype extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) in 2 providencia  stuartii and 5 providencia rettgeri. these esbls were coresistant to cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, ofloxacin, and sulfonamides but remained susceptible to imipenem. three beta-lactamases tem-2, tem-24, and dha-1 were detected. blatem-24, bladha-1, aac(6')-ib-cr, and qnra6 genes were successfully transferred to escherichia coli strain hb101, and they were found located on the conjugatifs  inca/c plasmids. genetic relatedness showed similar and different patterns among  p. stuartii and p. rettgeri strains, respectively.

TI  == substrate binding and specificity of rhomboid intramembrane protease revealed by  substrate-peptide complex structures.
AB  == the mechanisms of intramembrane proteases are incompletely understood due to the  lack of structural data on substrate complexes. to gain insight into substrate binding by rhomboid proteases, we have synthesised a series of novel peptidyl-chloromethylketone (cmk) inhibitors and analysed their interactions with escherichia coli rhomboid glpg enzymologically and structurally. we show that peptidyl-cmks derived from the natural rhomboid substrate tata from bacterium providencia stuartii bind glpg in a substrate-like manner, and their co-crystal structures with glpg reveal the s1 to s4 subsites of the protease. the s1 subsite is prominent and merges into the 'water retention site', suggesting intimate interplay between substrate binding, specificity and catalysis. unexpectedly, the s4 subsite is plastically formed by residues of the l1 loop, an important but hitherto enigmatic feature of the rhomboid fold. we propose that the homologous region of members of the wider rhomboid-like protein superfamily may have similar substrate or client-protein binding function. finally, using molecular dynamics,  we generate a model of the michaelis complex of the substrate bound in the active site of glpg.

TI  == allosteric regulation of rhomboid intramembrane proteolysis.
AB  == proteolysis within the lipid bilayer is poorly understood, in particular the regulation of substrate cleavage. rhomboids are a family of ubiquitous intramembrane serine proteases that harbour a buried active site and are known to cleave transmembrane substrates with broad specificity. in vitro gel and forster  resonance energy transfer (fret)-based kinetic assays were developed to analyse cleavage of the transmembrane substrate pstata (tata from providencia stuartii).  we demonstrate significant differences in catalytic efficiency (kcat/k0.5) values for transmembrane substrate pstata (tata from providencia stuartii) cleavage for  three rhomboids: aara from p. stuartii, ecglpg from escherichia coli and higlpg from haemophilus influenzae demonstrating that rhomboids specifically recognize this substrate. furthermore, binding of pstata occurs with positive cooperativity. competitive binding studies reveal an exosite-mediated mode of substrate binding, indicating allostery plays a role in substrate catalysis. we reveal that exosite formation is dependent on the oligomeric state of rhomboids,  and when dimers are dissociated, allosteric substrate activation is not observed. we present a novel mechanism for specific substrate cleavage involving several dynamic processes including positive cooperativity and homotropic allostery for this interesting class of intramembrane proteases.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the edible aromatic plant aristolochia delavayi.
AB  == the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation from the aerial parts of aristolochia delavayi franch. (aristolochiaceae), a unique edible aromatic plant  consumed by the nakhi (naxi) people in yunnan, china, was investigated using gc/ms analysis. in total, 95 components, representing more than 95% of the oil composition, were identified, and the main constituents found were (e)-dec-2-enal (52.0%), (e)-dodec-2-enal (6.8%), dodecanal (3.35%), heptanal (2.88%), and decanal (2.63%). the essential oil showed strong inhibitory activity (96% reduction) of the production of bacterial volatile sulfide compounds (vsc) by klebsiella pneumoniae, an effect that was comparable with that of the reference compound citral (91% reduction). moreover, the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil and the isolated major compound against eight bacterial and six fungal strains were evaluated. the essential oil showed significant antibacterial activity against providencia stuartii and escherichia coli, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 3.9 to 62.5 mug/ml. the oil also showed strong inhibitory activity against the fungal strains trichophyton ajelloi, trichophyton terrestre, candida glabrata, candida guilliermondii, and cryptococcus neoformans, with mic values ranging from 3.9 to 31.25 mug/ml, while  (e)-dec-2-enal presented a lower antifungal activity than the essential oil.

TI  == adverse effects of members of the enterobacteriaceae family on boar sperm quality.
AB  == semen samples collected in 2012 from 1785 boars belonging to five different breeds were recruited from the quality control laboratory of magapor sl, spain. these samples came from 43 boar studs and resulted from diluting the ejaculates in commercial semen extenders. evaluation of the semen sample characteristics (color, smell, ph, osmolality, concentration, motility of sperm cells, agglutination, acrosome integrity, short hypoosmotic swelling test, and abnormal  forms) revealed that they met the international standards. the samples were also  tested for the presence of aerobic bacterial contamination. in the present study, 14.73% (n = 263) of the semen samples were contaminated above 3 x 10(2) colony-forming units/ml with at least one type of bacteria. the enterobacteriaceae family was by far the major contaminant, being present in 40.68% of the contaminated samples (n = 107). bacterial strains of the enterobacteriaceae family isolated from boar semen samples were in order of incidence (percentage of the contaminated samples): serratia marcescens (12.55%), klebsiella oxytoca (11.79%), providencia stuartii (9.12%), morganella morganii (3.80%), proteus mirabilis (1.90%), and escherichia coli (1.52%). we have seen that the presence in semen samples of s. marcescens, k. oxytoca, m. morganii, or  p. mirabilis, but not p. stuartii or e. coli, was negatively associated with sperm motility (p < 0.05). the mean sperm concentration (p < 0.05), the mean percentage of spermatozoa with curled tails after the short hypoosmotic swelling  test (p < 0.01), and the incidence of morphologically normal acrosomes (p < 0.05) were also lower in semen samples infected with m. morganii compared with uninfected ones. moreover, p. mirabilis was negatively associated with the presence of abnormal forms. thus, on the basis of the pathological effects that some of these strains may have on boar sperm quality, bacterial contamination should always be examined in semen samples prepared for artificial insemination.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == role of rhomboid proteases in bacteria.
AB  == the first member of the rhomboid family of intramembrane serine proteases in bacteria was discovered almost 20years ago. it is now known that rhomboid proteins are widely distributed in bacteria, with some bacteria containing multiple rhomboids. at the present time, only a single rhomboid-dependent function in bacteria has been identified, which is the cleavage of tata in providencia stuartii. mutational analysis has shown that loss of the glpg rhomboid in escherichia coli alters cefotaxime resistance, loss of the yqgp (glup) rhomboid in bacillus subtilis alters cell division and glucose uptake, and loss of the msmeg_5036 and msmeg_4904 genes in mycobacterium smegmatis results in altered colony morphology, biofilm formation and antibiotic susceptibilities. however, the cellular substrates for these proteins have not been identified. in  addition, analysis of the rhombosortases, together with their possible gly-gly cterm substrates, may shed new light on the role of these proteases in bacteria.  this article is part of a special issue entitled: intramembrane proteases.

TI  == characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  == a total of 788 clinical enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (ame genes) and to characterize the plasmids that  carry these genes. among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 escherichia coli (80%), 33 proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six k. oxytoca (1.8%), five enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three morganella morganii (0.9%), three providencia stuartii (0.9%), two  salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each citrobacter freundii, c. koseri, proteus vulgaris, and shigella sonnei. the most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin  (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). the ame genes found were aph(3'')-ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-ia (37.5%), aph(3')-ia (13.9%), aac(3)-iia (12.4%), aac(6')-ib  (4.2%), ant(2'')-ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-iia (1.2%). thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. the most frequent association was ant(3'')-ia plus aph(3'')-ib (35 strains). from 66 selected ame genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-iia, six aph(3')-ia, three ant(3'')-ia, two ant(2'')-ia, and one aac(6')-ib. these genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups f, fia, fib, or hi2. in conclusion, the ame genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-iia, aac(6')-ib, and ant(2'')-ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.

TI  == processing by rhomboid protease is required for providencia stuartii tata to interact with tatc and to form functional homo-oligomeric complexes.
AB  == the twin arginine transport (tat) system transports folded proteins across the prokaryotic cytoplasmic membrane and the plant thylakoid membrane. in escherichia coli three membrane proteins, tata, tatb and tatc, are essential components of the machinery. tata from providencia stuartii is homologous to e. coli tata but is synthesized as an inactive pre-protein with an n-terminal extension of eight amino acids. removal of this extension by the rhomboid protease aara is required  to activate p. stuartii tata. here we show that p. stuartii tata can functionally substitute for e. coli tata provided that the e. coli homologue of aara, glpg, is present. the oligomerization state of the p. stuartii tata pro-protein was compared with that of the proteolytically activated protein and with e. coli tata. the pro-protein still formed small homo-oligomers but cannot form large tatbc-dependent assemblies. in the absence of tatb, e. coli tata or the processed form of p. stuartii tata form a complex with tatc. however, this complex is not observed with the pro-form of p. stuartii tata. taken together our results suggest that the p. stuartii tata pro-protein is inactive because it is unable to interact with tatc and cannot form the large tata complexes required for transport.

TI  == complete sequence of a novel 178-kilobase plasmid carrying bla(ndm-1) in a providencia stuartii strain isolated in afghanistan.
AB  == in response to global concerns over the spread of the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene 1, bla(ndm-1), a monthly surveillance program was initiated in september 2010. all carbapenem-resistant gram-negative strains forwarded to our facility are screened for this gene. to date, 321 carbapenem-resistant isolates, encompassing 11 bacterial species, have been tested. in february 2011, two strains of providencia stuartii, submitted from a military hospital in afghanistan, tested positive for bla(ndm-1). both strains were identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). bla(ndm-1) was carried on a large plasmid, pmr0211, which was sequenced by emulsion pcr and pyrosequencing. pmr0211 is 178,277 bp in size and belongs to incompatibility group a/c. the plasmid consists of a backbone with considerable homology to par060302 from escherichia coli, and it retains many of the antibiotic resistance genes associated with it. the plasmid also shares common elements with the pndm-hk plasmid, including bla(ndm-1), arma, and sul1. however, gene orientation  is reversed, and a 3-kb fragment from this region is absent from pmr0211. pmr0211 also contains additional genes, including the aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme loci aada and aac(6'), the quinolone resistance gene qnra, a gene with highest homology to a u32 family peptidase from shewanella amazonensis, and the bla(oxa-10) gene. the finding of this gene in an intrinsically colistin-resistant species such as providencia stuartii is especially worrisome, as it renders the organism resistant to nearly every available antibiotic. the presence of multiple insertion sequences and transposons flanking the region containing the bla(ndm-1) gene further highlights the potential mobility associated with this gene.

TI  == antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of selected egyptian medicinal plants.
AB  == medicinal plants have been used as a source of remedies since ancient times in egypt. the present study was designed to investigate the antibacterial activity and the cytotoxicity of the organic extracts from 16 selected medicinal plants of egypt. the study was also extended to the isolation of the antiproliferative compound jaeschkeanadiol p-hydroxybenzoate (fh-25) from ferula hermonis. the microbroth dilution was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of the samples against twelve bacterial strains belonging to four species,  providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli, while a resazurin assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of  the extracts on the human pancreatic cancer cell line miapaca-2, breast cancer cell line mcf-7, ccrf-cem leukemia cells, and their multidrug resistant subline,  cem/adr5000. the results of the mic determination indicated that all the studied  crude extracts were able to inhibit the growth of at least one of the tested bacterial species, the best activity being recorded with the crude extracts from  f. hermonis and vitis vinifera, whichwere active against 91.7% and 83.3% of the studied bacteria, respectively. the lowest mic value of 128 mug/ml was recorded against p. stuartii atcc 29916 and e. coli atcc 10536 with the extract from v. vinifera and commiphora molmol, respectively. in the cytotoxicity study, ic50 values below 20 mug/ml were recorded for the crude extract of f. hermonis on all  four studied cancer cell lines. fh-25 also showed good cytotoxicity against mcf-7 cells (ic50: 2.47 mug/ml). finally, the results of the present investigation provided supportive data for the possible use of the plant extracts investigated  herein, mostly f. hermonis and v. vinifera in the treatment of bacterial infections and jaeschkeanadiol p-hydroxybenzoate in the control of cancer diseases.

TI  == first detection of tem-116 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in a providencia stuartii isolate from a tunisian hospital.
AB  == purpose: to study the resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in providencia stuartii strain isolated from hospitalized patient in tunisia and to  identify the responsible genes materials and methods: this strain was analysed by pcr and sequencing to identify the genes responsible for the beta-lactamase resistance phenotypes. the transferability of the phenotypes was tested by conjugation to escherichia coli j53. the isoelectric point was determinate by isoelectrofocalisation. results: this resistance was carried by a 60 kb plasmid that encoded a beta-lactamase with a pi of 5.4. this beta-lactamase revealed identity with the blatem-1 gene encoding the tem-1 beta-lactamase, except for a replacement of the val residue at position 84 by ile, and the ala residue at position 184 by val. these two mutations were encountered in tem-116 beta-lactamase. conclusion: this study demonstrates the fi rst description of tem-116 in the p. stuartii species in the world and the fi rst one in a tunisian  hospital.

TI  == occurrence of gram-negative bacteria in hens' eggs depending on their source and  storage conditions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the qualitative composition of gram-negative microbes, mainly of the family enterobacteriaceae, including pathogenic bacteria  such as salmonella, in the albumens and yolks and on the shells of hens' eggs, depending on their source and on the temperature and duration of their storage. a total of 375 table eggs were studied, from a large-scale poultry farm, a small-scale poultry farm and a supermarket. each group was divided into 5 subgroups according to the temperature and duration of their storage during the study. two serotypes of bacteria of the genus salmonella were identified: s. enteritidis and s. arizonae. strains of salmonella spp. were also isolated. apart from salmonella and escherichia coli, among the most frequently isolated bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae were enterobacter spp., klebsiella spp. and citrobacter freundii. qualitative analysis of the bacterial microflora of the eggs also showed the presence of other gram negative bacteria, including acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas spp., tatumella ptyseos, providencia stuartii, serratia liquefaciens, flavimonas oryzihabitans, vibrio metschnikovii, leclercia  adecarboxylata, kluyvera spp., rahnella aquatilis, proteus mirabilis, and achromobacter spp. the study demonstrated that the conditions applied, i.e., the  temperature and duration of storage, did not significantly influence the prevalence of particular species of gram-negative bacteria in the eggs. however,  based on the analysis of contamination of eggs with salmonella depending on their source, it can be concluded that the system in which the hens are housed affects  the risk of contamination of eggs with these pathogens.

TI  == substrate specificity of a recombinant d-lyxose isomerase from providencia stuartii for monosaccharides.
AB  == the specific activity and catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/k(m)) of the recombinant putative protein from providencia stuartii was the highest for d-lyxose among the aldose substrates, indicating that it is a d-lyxose isomerase. gel filtration analysis suggested that the native enzyme is a dimer with a molecular mass of 44  kda. the maximal activity for d-lyxose isomerization was observed at ph 7.5 and 45 degrees c in the presence of 1 mm mn(2+). the enzyme exhibited high isomerization activity for aldose substrates with the c2 and c3 hydroxyl groups in the left-hand configuration, such as d-lyxose, d-mannose, l-ribose, d-talose,  and l-allose (listed in decreasing order of activity). the enzyme exhibited the highest activity for d-xylulose among all pentoses and hexoses. thus, d-lyxose was produced at 288 g/l from 500 g/l d-xylulose by d-lyxose isomerase at ph 7.5 and 45 degrees c for 2 h, with a conversion yield of 58% and a volumetric productivity of 144 g l(-1) h(-1). the observed k(cat)/k(m) (920 mm(-1) s(-1)) of p. stuartiid-lyxose isomerase for d-xylulose is higher than any of the k(cat)/k(m) values previously reported for sugar and sugar phosphate isomerases with monosaccharide substrates. these results suggest that the enzyme will be useful as an industrial producer of d-lyxose.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  == the emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (ltcf) residents around bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. all routine enterobacteriaceae isolates from a bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated  long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for mbls, with case details reviewed for the source patients. in total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 escherichia coli, six klebsiella pneumoniae, four klebsiella oxytoca, four citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae and two morganella morganii, as well as single citrobacter amalonaticus, enterobacter aerogenes, providencia stuartii and proteus mirabilis isolates. all were pcr-positive for bla(vim) and 25 were pcr-positive for qnrs; 19 non-k. pneumoniae had bla(shv) and one had bla(ctx-m-group1); 13 were from 12 ltcf residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. all these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or ltcf stay; only seven had infections due to the mbl producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. five patients had more than one mbl-producing organism.  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related e. coli, whereas pairs of k. pneumoniae and c. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be pcr-positive for bla(vim), qnrs and bla(shv); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(vim-1), qnrs1 and bla(shv-12) were detected by sequencing.

AB  == five different strains of bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from two patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the central military hospital of algiers, algeria. all five strains, one providencia  stuartii strain, two escherichia coli strains, and two klebsiella pneumoniae strains, were intermediate or resistant to all beta-lactams, including carbapenems. synergy between imipenem and edta was observed for all five strains. the results of the pcr experiment confirmed the presence of a bla(vim) gene in all five strains. the bla(vim) genes were located as part of a class 1 integron on a 180-kb conjugative plasmid. they encoded a novel metallo-beta-lactamase designated vim-19, which differed from the parental enzyme vim-1 by only two substitutions: ser228arg, previously observed in the closely related enzyme vim-4, and asn215lys, not previously observed in other vim-type carbapenemases. vim-19 was further characterized after purification through determination of its  kinetic constants. this enzyme was inhibited by edta and hydrolyzed penicillins,  cephalosporins, and carbapenems, as observed for other vim-type carbapenemases but with greater catalytic efficiency against penicillins than vim-1. vim-19 is the first carbapenemase enzyme identified from an isolate from algeria. these results confirm the emergence of vim-4-like enzymes in members of the family enterobacteriaceae from mediterranean countries.

TI  == novel ctx-m {beta}-lactamase genotype distribution and spread into multiple species of enterobacteriaceae in changsha, southern china.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to undertake a survey of the occurrence of  ctx-m and shv extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genotypes in enterobacteriaceae from hunan province, china. methods: clinical isolates (425) from three major hospitals in changsha, hunan province, were collected between october 2004 and july 2005, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities of the genotype of bla(ctx-m) and bla(shv) were determined. random amplified polymorphic dna was used to characterize the clonality of all of the isolates. results: the overall rate of esbl-positive isolates was 33.4% (142/425). the dominant esbls were ctx-m types, and were found in 109/142 (76.8%) isolates comprising seven different genera/species, namely escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris and providencia stuartii. the most common bla(ctx-m) genotypes were bla(ctx-m-14) (47.7%), bla(ctx-m-3) (29.4%) and bla(ctx-m-15) (17.4%). a novel gene derived from bla(ctx-m-15), bla(ctx-m-82) (ala-40-->pro), was identified. conclusions: the dominant esbl genotype in hunan province was bla(ctx-m). the high prevalence (17.4%) of bla(ctx-m-15) has not previously been reported from china. our results identify that an epidemic of bla(ctx-m) in changsha, hunan province, has evolved with the appearance and spread of bla(ctx-m-15) against the dominant genotypes bla(ctx-m-14) and bla(ctx-m-3.) the worldwide dominance of bla(ctx-m-15) could be poised to spread to china, displacing the current prevailing genotypes.

TI  == evaluation of different laboratory tests for the detection of metallo-beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == objectives: clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (91), escherichia coli (49), enterobacter spp. (27), proteus mirabilis (17), citrobacter freundii (2), providencia stuartii (3) and serratia spp. (5), with various mics of imipenem, were examined for production of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) with different phenotypic laboratory tests that have been previously published to detect mbls in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. methods: a total of 194 (95 mbl-positive and 99 mbl-negative) clinical isolates with imipenem mics < or = 0.25 to > 256 mg/l were examined. all isolates were evaluated by the double-disc  synergy test (ddst), the combination disc test (cdt), the mbl etest and the modified hodge test. the presence of bla(vim) and bla(imp) genes was evaluated by in situ hybridization with specific probes and was certified by pcr. results: in  30 bla(vim)-positive isolates that exhibited mics of imipenem < or = 4 mg/l, mbl  etest could not be evaluated. cdt with ceftazidime and 1900 or 750 microg of edta, and ddst after applying an imipenem disc 10 mm apart from a disc containing approximately 1900 microg of edta, showed the highest sensitivity (97.9% to 100%) and specificity (87.9% to 96%) rates among the analysed procedures. cdt with imipenem and 1900 microg of edta exhibited a sensitivity of 94.7% and showed very good specificity (98%). conclusions: the cdt with imipenem/imipenem+0.5 m edta or ceftazidime/ceftazidime+0.2 m edta and the ddst with imipenem 10 mm apart from edta are the most effective methods for the detection of mbls in enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

TI  == prevalence of community-occurring extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in brazil.
AB  == the occurrence of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains in the community was investigated in a private laboratory located in juiz de fora, brazil. all enterobacterial isolates analysed were collected from urine of human  patients between the years 2000 and 2002. esbl production was confirmed by double disk screening, combination disk method, and etest esbl strip. the isoelectric point of each beta-lactamase was determined in the crude extracts from each isolate. detection of esbl genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction and the genetic relatedness of the isolates determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). of the 1,481 isolates, 22 (12 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 escherichia coli, 1 providencia stuartii, 1 citrobacter freundii, and 1 serratia  marcescens) were identified as esbl producers. the frequency of esbl producers in the community was 1.48%. tem-type enzymes were identified in 95.4% of the isolates, followed by the shv type. seven strains produced ctx-m-type enzymes. this study showed that strains producing multiple beta-lactamases are also present in community-acquired bacterial isolates. multiple strains exhibiting identical pfge genotypes were found in individual patients indicating a common source of acquisition.

TI  == [evaluation of vitek 2 performance for identifying extended spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae "other than escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp"].
AB  == production of beta-lactamases is the main resistance mechanism of gram-negative bacteria against beta-lactam antibiotics. extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) have the ability to hydrolyze a broader spectrum of beta-lactam drugs. hence rapid, accurate detection of this resistance mechanism is extremely important to guide proper patient antimicrobial therapy. these enzymes are most commonly produced by klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli, but may also occur widely in other gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter spp., proteus spp., morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens and others that also produce other chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes, like ampc beta-lactamases. the main problem is that no clsi (clinical and laboratory standards institute) recommendations exist for esbl detection for enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp and for detecting plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases. we carried out an evaluation of vitek 2 advanced expert system (aes) performance for identifying esbl in enterobacteriaceae, also other than e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp, comparing results obtained with etest and double disk data. seventy isolates of enterobacteriaceae were tested for the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) by using vitek 2, etest and the double disk method. the use of etest was performed as a gold standard method by comparing interpretation  results of vitek 2 advanced expert system (aes). in comparison with the etest method, aes produced 19 esbl warnings, of which only 5 were classified as major misunderstandings, especially for enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli, proteus  mirabilis and klebsiella spp which produced plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases. the etest, together with the cefoxitin sensibility test, was found to be the best method to confirm esbls and distinguish ampc from esbls.

TI  == accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a prospective study is carried out to evaluate the performance of a protocol for  the accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria. a modified double-disc test (mddt) is incorporated in a gram-negative template for routine susceptibility testing. the mddt identified accurately esbls in all isolates subsequently confirmed as esbl-producers by the  standard clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) combined disc method. of  1213 isolates tested, 98 (8%) were positive for esbls by mddt and 95 (7.8%) were  positive by the clsi method. esbls were detected in 48 (7.8%) e. coli, 21 (8%) k. pneumoniae, 12 (5.8%) proteus mirabilis, 13 (18.8%) providencia stuartii and four (6.8%) enterobacter cloacae isolates. time required for esbl detection by the mddt method was one day. the protocol described provides a simple, rapid and low-cost method for early detection of esbls in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == trends in production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteria of medical interest: report of the second italian nationwide survey.
AB  == results of a 2003 survey carried out in italy to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteria are presented. eleven italian microbiology laboratories investigated 9,076 consecutive nonreplicate isolates (inpatients, 6,850; outpatients, 2,226). esbl screening was performed by mic data analysis. confirmation was obtained using the double-disk synergy test and the combination disk test based on clsi methodology. esbl determinants were investigated by colony blot hybridization and confirmed by sequencing. results were compared to those of the 1999 italian survey (8,015 isolates). the prevalence of esbl producers was 7.4% among isolates from inpatients (in 1999, 6.3%) and 3.5% among outpatients (no data were available for 1999). among hospitalized patients, the most prevalent esbl-positive species was  escherichia coli (klebsiella pneumoniae in 1999). proteus mirabilis was the most  prevalent esbl-positive species among outpatients. in both groups, most esbl-positive pathogens were obtained from urinary tract infections. tem-type esbls were the most prevalent enzymes (45.4%). non-tem, non-shv determinants emerged: ctx-m-type in e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and per-type in p. mirabilis, providencia spp., and e. coli. with the exception of 3/163 p. mirabilis isolates  and 1/44 providencia stuartii isolate (all of which were intermediate for imipenem), carbapenems were active against all esbl-positive enterobacteria. susceptibility to other drugs was as follows: 84.7% for amikacin, 84.4% for piperacillin-tazobactam, 48.0% for gentamicin, and 32.8% for ciprofloxacin. carbapenems appear to be the drug of choice. amikacin and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations represent an alternative in non-life-threatening infections. the appearance of esbl-positive enterobacteria in the community makes it mandatory that family physicians learn how to treat these pathogens.

TI  == functional characterization of escherichia coli glpg and additional rhomboid proteins using an aara mutant of providencia stuartii.
AB  == the providencia stuartii aara protein is a member of the rhomboid family of intramembrane serine proteases and required for the production of an extracellular signaling molecule that regulates cellular functions including peptidoglycan acetylation, methionine transport, and cysteine biosynthesis. additional aara-dependent phenotypes include (i) loss of an extracellular yellow  pigment, (ii) inability to grow on macconkey agar, and (iii) abnormal cell division. since these phenotypes are easily assayed, the p. stuartii aara mutant  serves as a useful host system to investigate rhomboid function. the escherichia  coli glpg protein was shown to be functionally similar to aara and rescued the above aara-dependent phenotypes in p. stuartii. glpg proteins containing single alanine substitutions at the highly conserved catalytic triad of asparagine (n154a), serine (s201a), or histidine (h254a) residues were nonfunctional. the p. stuartii aara mutant was also used as a biosensor to demonstrate that proteins from a variety of diverse sources exhibited rhomboid activity. in an effort to further investigate the role of a rhomboid protein in cell physiology, a glpg mutant of e. coli was constructed. in phenotype microarray experiments, the glpg  mutant exhibited a slight increase in resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotic cefotaxime.

TI  == clonal occurrences of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli: report from the  meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection surveillance program  in the united states (2004).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. between 1999 and 2004, a total of 10-16 us medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. over this 6-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 12 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 15990 bacterial isolates using clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) reference methods. analysis of the mic results by year within organism species and/or organism groups revealed a continued decrease in fluoroquinolone susceptibility (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), especially among indole-positive proteae (-22.1%), escherichia coli (-17.0%), enterobacter species (-10.0%), and proteus mirabilis (-7.6%) isolates. antibiogram analysis of strains demonstrating multidrug resistance from the same institutions were further characterized by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine clonality. in 2004, a total of 165 selected multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains produced 64 different ribotypes with the largest representing 31 escherichia coli isolates from 6 medical centers. other clusters were also identified within single medical centers among enterobacter cloacae (6 strains), providencia stuartii (5 strains), and morganella morganii (4 strains). a significant clonal outbreak encompassing 40 acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 3 centers in a single endemic region was identified in 1999 and has persisted through 2004. continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against mdr pathogens appears warranted to monitor the incidence and spread of resistant clones causing serious infections. possible emergence of resistance mechanisms via clonal dissemination  proves to be among the principle threats that compromise carbapenem therapy, where meropenem maintains the broadest spectrum of coverage.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == acid phosphatase/phosphotransferases from enteric bacteria.
AB  == we have investigated the enzymatic phosphorylation of nucleosides and found that  morganella morganii phoc acid phosphatase exhibits regioselective pyrophosphate (pp(i))-nucleoside phosphotransferase activity. in this study, we isolated genes  encoding an acid phosphatase with regioselective phosphotransferase activity (ap/ptase) from providencia stuartii, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia blattae and klebsiella planticola, and compared the primary structures and enzymatic characteristics of these enzymes with those of ap/ptase (phoc acid phosphatase) from m. morganii. the enzymes were highly homologous in primary structure with m. morganii ap/ptase, and are classified as class a1 acid phosphatases. the synthesis of inosine-5'-monophosphate (5'-imp) by e. coli overproducing each acid phosphatase was investigated. the p. stuartii enzyme, which is most closely related to the m. morganii enzyme, exhibited high 5'-imp productivity, similar to the m. morganii enzyme. the 5'-imp productivities of the e. aerogenes, e. blattae and k. planticola enzymes were inferior to those of the former two enzymes. this  result underlines the importance of lower k(m) values for efficient nucleotide production. as these enzymes exhibited a very high degree of homology at the amino acid sequence level, it is likely that local sequence differences in the binding pocket are responsible for the differences in the nucleoside-pp(i) phosphotransferase reaction.

TI  == role of cyse in production of an extracellular signaling molecule in providencia  stuartii and escherichia coli: loss of cyse enhances biofilm formation in escherichia coli.
AB  == a mini-tn5cm insertion has been identified that significantly reduced the amount  of an extracellular activating signal for a lacz fusion (cma37::lacz) in providencia stuartii. the transposon insertion was located immediately upstream of an open reading frame encoding a putative cyse ortholog. the cyse enzyme, serine acetyltransferase, catalyzes the conversion of serine to o-acetyl-l-serine (oas). this activating signal was also produced by escherichia coli, and production was abolished in a strain containing a null allele of cyse. products of the cyse enzyme (oas, n-acetyl-l-serine [nas], o-acetyl-l-threonine, and n-acetyl-l-threonine) were individually tested for the ability to activate cma37::lacz. only oas was capable of activating the cma37::lacz fusion. the ability of oas to activate the cma37::lacz fusion was abolished by pretreatment at ph 8.5, which converts oas to nas. however, the activity of the native signal  in conditioned medium was not decreased by treatment at ph 8.5. in contrast, conditioned medium prepared from cells grown at ph 8.5 exhibited a 4- to 10-fold-higher activity, relative to ph 6.0. additional genes regulated by the cyse-dependent signal and oas were identified in p. stuartii and e. coli. the response to the extracellular signal in e. coli was dependent on cysb, a positive activator that requires nas as a coactivator. in e. coli, a cyse mutant formed biofilms at an accelerated rate compared to the wild type, suggesting a physiological role for this extracellular signal.

TI  == gemifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == gemifloxacin is a dual targeted fluoroquinolone with potent in vitro activity against gram-positive, -negative and atypical human pathogens--pathogens considered to be important causes of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. gemifloxacin demonstrates impressive minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic 90 ) values against clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, chlamydia pneumoniae and legionella spp., with mic 90 values reported to be 0.016-0.06, < 0.0008-0.06, 0.008-0.3, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.016-0.07 microg/ml, respectively. gemifloxacin is also active in vitro against a broad range of gram-negative bacilli with mic 90 values against the enterobacteriaceae in the range of 0.016 to > 16 microg/ml ( escherichia coli and providencia stuartii, respectively), with the majority of the genus having mic 90 drug concentrations < 0.5 microg/ml. the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against anaerobic organisms is variable. the mic values  for gemifloxacin are not affected by beta-lactamase production nor by penicillin  or macrolide resistance in s. pneumoniae. gemifloxacin is approved by the fda to  be clinically efficacious against multi-drug resistant s. pneumoniae. the pharmacokinetics of gemifloxacin are such that the drug can be administered orally once-daily to yield or achieve sustainable drug concentrations exceeding the mic values of clinically important organisms. gemifloxacin has been shown to  target both dna gyrase (preferred target) and topoisomerase iv (secondary target) - enzymes critical for dna replication and organism survival - against clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. this dual targeting activity is thought to be important for reducing the likelihood for selecting for quinolone resistance. gemifloxacin has been investigated and approved for therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. in one study, more patients receiving gemifloxacin compared to clarithromycin remained free of exacerbations for longer periods of time (p < 0.016) and gemifloxacin had a shorter time to eradication of h. influenzae than did clarithromycin (p < 0.02). from efficacy studies, gemifloxacin was found to have  an adverse profile that was comparable with other compounds. the most frequent side effects were diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. gemifloxacin is a welcomed addition to currently available agents for the treatment of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. other potential indications appear to be within the spectrum of this compound.

TI  == cell-to-cell signalling in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica.
AB  == cell-to-cell signalling in prokaryotes that leads to co-ordinated behaviour has been termed quorum sensing. this type of signalling can have profound impacts on  microbial community structure and host-microbe interactions. the gram-negative quorum-sensing systems were first discovered and extensively characterized in the marine vibrios. some components of the vibrio systems are present in the classical genetic model organisms escherichia coli and salmonella enterica. both  organisms encode a signal receptor of the luxr family, sdia, but not a corresponding signal-generating enzyme. instead, sdia of salmonella detects and responds to signals generated only by other microbial species. conversely, e. coli and salmonella encode the signal-generating component of a second system (a  luxs homologue that generates ai-2), but the sensory apparatus for ai-2 differs substantially from the vibrio system. the only genes currently known to be regulated by ai-2 in salmonella encode an active uptake and modification system for ai-2. therefore, it is not yet clear whether salmonella uses ai-2 as a signal molecule or whether ai-2 has some other function. in e. coli, the functions of both sdia and ai-2 are unclear due to pleiotropy. genetic strategies to identify  novel signalling systems have been performed with e. coli and providencia stuartii. several putative signalling systems have been identified, one that uses indole as a signal and another that releases what appears to be a peptide. the latter system has homologues in e. coli and salmonella, as well as other bacteria, plants and animals. in fact, the protease components from providencia and drosophila are functionally interchangeable.

TI  == isolation and characterization of integron-containing bacteria without antibiotic selection.
AB  == the emergence of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic and commensal bacteria has become a serious problem worldwide. the use and overuse of antibiotics in a number of settings are contributing to the development of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. the class 1 and 2 integrase genes (inti1 and inti2, respectively) were identified in mixed bacterial cultures enriched from bovine feces by growth  in buffered peptone water (bpw) followed by integrase-specific pcr. integrase-positive bacterial colonies from the enrichment cultures were then isolated by using hydrophobic grid membrane filters and integrase-specific gene probes. bacterial clones isolated by this technique were then confirmed to carry  integrons by further testing by pcr and dna sequencing. integron-associated antibiotic resistance genes were detected in bacteria such as escherichia coli, aeromonas spp., proteus spp., morganella morganii, shewanella spp., and urea-positive providencia stuartii isolates from bovine fecal samples without the use of selective enrichment media containing antibiotics. streptomycin and trimethoprim resistance were commonly associated with integrons. the advantages conferred by this methodology are that a wide variety of integron-containing bacteria may be simultaneously cultured in bpw enrichments and culture biases due to antibiotic selection can be avoided. rapid and efficient identification, isolation, and characterization of antibiotic resistance-associated integrons are possible by this protocol. these methods will facilitate greater understanding of the factors that contribute to the presence and transfer of integron-associated antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial isolates from red meat production animals.

AB  == in 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the aquitaine region in france produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). among these were 19 enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 escherichia coli isolates; 3 proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii. esbl producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes  and 5 ambulatory patients. seven different esbls were characterized. these mainly consisted of tem-24 (25 isolates) and tem-21 (9 isolates), but tem-15 (2 isolates) and tem-3, tem-19, shv-4, and ctx-m-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. seven strains showed the coexistence of different tem- and/or shv-encoding genes, including a new shv-1 variant, shv-44, defined by the substitution r205l previously reported for shv-3 in association with s238g. the epidemiology of the esbl producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic dna, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the esbl, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the esbl-encoding plasmids. of the tem-24-expressing strains, 18 were e. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in france. of the tem-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. the presence of esbl producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in general practice.

AB  == we demonstrated previously that genetic inactivation of tryptophanase is responsible for a dramatic decrease in biofilm formation in the laboratory strain escherichia coli s17-1. in the present study, we tested whether the biochemical inhibition of tryptophanase, with the competitive inhibitor oxindolyl-l-alanine,  could affect polystyrene colonization by e. coli and other indole-producing bacteria. oxindolyl-l-alanine inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, indole production and biofilm formation by strain s17-1 grown in luria-bertani (lb) medium. supplementation with indole at physiologically relevant concentrations restores biofilm formation by strain s17-1 in the presence of oxindolyl-l-alanine and by mutant strain e. coli 3714 (s17-1 tnaa::tn5) in lb medium. oxindolyl-l-alanine also inhibits the adherence of s17-1 cells to polystyrene for a 3-h incubation time, but mutant strain 3714 cells are unaffected. at 0.5 mg/ml, oxindolyl-l-alanine exhibits inhibitory activity against biofilm formation in lb  medium and in synthetic urine for several clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, providencia stuartii, and morganella morganii but has no affect on indole-negative klebsiella pneumoniae strains. in conclusion, these data suggest that indole, produced by the action of tryptophanase, is involved in polystyrene colonization by several indole-producing bacterial species. indole may act as a signalling molecule to regulate the expression of adhesion and biofilm-promoting factors.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in buenos aires, argentina, public hospitals.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). in order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of esbls in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from april to may 2000. extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. from a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards' screening and confirmatory tests for esbl production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and pcr amplification using specific primers. three different esbls were detected: shv-related (4 isolates), per-2-type (9 isolates), and ctx-m-2-related (26 isolates). sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed ctx-m-2 in 19 of 21 and ctx-m-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. ctx-m-2 (or its variant) was detected in all escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and providencia stuartii strains, while per-2 was detected in enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae; shv-related esbl were found only in k. pneumoniae. these results clearly show that ctx-m-2 is the most prevalent esbl produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in buenos aires.

TI  == escherichia coli 83972 inhibits catheter adherence by a broad spectrum of uropathogens.
AB  == objectives: the presence of a nonpathogenic organism on the surface of a urinary  catheter might impede catheter colonization by pathogens and thus prevent urinary tract infection. previously, we reported that preinoculating urinary catheters with a nonpathogenic strain of escherichia coli (83972) significantly impeded catheter colonization in vitro by gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis). to explore this phenomenon further, we investigated in vitro whether e. coli 83972 could likewise inhibit catheter colonization by gram-negative and fungal uropathogens (providencia stuartii, uropathogenic e. coli, and candida albicans). methods: for each of the three uropathogens tested, we examined three different incubation conditions: (a) e. coli plus uropathogen catheters were exposed to e.  coli 83972 for 24 hours and then to a uropathogen for 30 minutes; (b) e. coli-alone catheters were incubated with e. coli for 24 hours and then in sterile broth for 30 minutes; and (c) uropathogen-alone catheters were incubated in sterile broth for 24 hours before the 30-minute incubation with the uropathogen.  all catheters were subsequently incubated in sterile human urine for 24 hours. catheters were then rinsed and sonicated to determine the numbers of adherent organisms per centimeter. results: pre-exposure of the catheter to e. coli 83972  in all cases significantly reduced the number of uropathogens colonizing the catheter surfaces. conclusions: e. coli 83972 significantly impedes catheter colonization by all tested bacterial and fungal pathogens. the broad applicability of this particular approach to bacterial interference in vitro invites further exploration in vivo.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == conservation of intramembrane proteolytic activity and substrate specificity in prokaryotic and eukaryotic rhomboids.
AB  == rhomboid is an intramembrane serine protease responsible for the proteolytic activation of drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) ligands. although nothing is known about the function of the approximately 100 currently known rhomboid genes conserved throughout evolution, a recent analysis suggests that a rhomboid from the pathogenic bacterium providencia stuartii is involved in the production of a quorum-sensing factor. this suggests that an intercellular signaling mechanism may have been conserved between prokaryotes and metazoans. however, the function of prokaryotic rhomboids is unknown. we have examined the ability of eight prokaryotic rhomboids to cleave the three drosophila egfr ligands. despite their striking sequence divergence, rhomboids from one gram-positive and four gram-negative species, including providencia, specifically cleaved drosophila substrates, but not similar proteins such as transforming growth factor alpha (tgfalpha) and delta. although the sequence similarity between these divergent rhomboids is very limited, all contain the putative serine catalytic triad residues, and their specific mutation abolished protease activity. therefore, despite low overall homology, the rhomboids are a family of  ancient, functionally conserved intramembrane serine proteases, some of which also have conserved substrate specificity. moreover, a function for rhomboids in  activating intercellular signaling appears to have evolved early.

TI  == urea-dependent signal transduction by the virulence regulator urer.
AB  == identification of the environmental triggers involved in the expression of virulence genes is a fundamental objective in studies of bacterial pathogens. for uropathogens, urea, found in the urinary tract at concentrations of up to 500 mm, functions as an environmental signal. urea freely diffuses into the bacterium providencia stuartii and activates urer, a member of the arac family of transcriptional activators. active urer promotes transcription of virulence-associated urease genes and alerts the organisms of its immediate milieu. thus, the urer.urea complex has a dual role, acting as both a transcriptional activator as well as an environmental sensor. here, we describe the molecular events associated with activation of gene expression by urea-bound  urer. the k(d) of the urea.urer binding reaction was measured as 0.2 mm by fluorescence quenching assays, and the shape of the binding curve indicated a single specific urea-binding site on urer. histidine residues are critical for urea binding in urease, and therefore to identify the urea-binding site in urer,  five mutant urer forms were generated with histidine to alanine substitutions. two of the mutants (urer(c)) exhibited a constitutive phenotype by both activating transcription and binding to dna with an increased affinity in the absence of urea. the urer(c) bound urea with an affinity similar to that of wild-type urer. we concluded, therefore, that the mutations resulting in constitutive activity were not involved in the urer.urea interaction. urer was activated, then, either by binding urea or by histidine to alanine substitutions  at one of two positions. circular dichroism indicated little change in the structure of urer when activated, and size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated  that both rurer and rurer(c) were dimers in both the presence and absence of urea. thus, the structural changes associated with activation are subtle.

TI  == resistant pathogens in urinary tract infections.
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (uti) has evolved over several decades as antimicrobial exposure has repeatedly been followed by emergence of resistance. older populations in the community, long-term care facilities, or acute care facilities have an increased prevalence  of resistant bacteria isolated from uti. resistant isolates are more frequent in  long-term care populations than the community. resistant isolates include common  uropathogens, such as escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis, and organisms with higher levels of intrinsic resistance, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa or providencia stuartii. isolation of resistant organisms is consistently associated with prior antimicrobial exposure and higher functional impairment. the increased likelihood of resistant bacteria makes it essential that a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility testing be obtained before instituting antimicrobial therapy. therapy for the individual patient must be balanced with the possibility that antimicrobial use will promote further resistance. antimicrobial therapy should be avoided unless there is a clear clinical indication. in particular, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antimicrobials. where symptoms are mild or equivocal, urine culture results should be obtained before initiating therapy. this permits selection of specific therapy for the infecting  organism and avoids empiric, usually broad-spectrum, therapy. where empirical therapy is necessary, prior infecting organisms should be isolated, and recent antimicrobial therapy, as well as regional or facility susceptibility patterns, should be considered in antimicrobial choice. where empirical therapy is used, it should be reassessed 48 to 72 hours after initiation, once pretherapy cultures are available.

TI  == identification of escherichia coli ubib, a gene required for the first monooxygenase step in ubiquinone biosynthesis.
AB  == it was recently discovered that the aarf gene in providencia stuartii is required for coenzyme q (coq) biosynthesis. here we report that yigr, the escherichia coli homologue of aarf, is ubib, a gene required for the first monooxygenase step in coq biosynthesis. both the p. stuartii aarf and e. coli ubib (yigr) disruption mutant strains lack coq and accumulate octaprenylphenol. octaprenylphenol is the  coq biosynthetic intermediate found to accumulate in the e. coli strain an59, which contains the ubib409 mutant allele. analysis of the mutation in the e. coli strain an59 reveals no mutations within the ubib gene, but instead shows the presence of an is1 element at position +516 of the ubie gene. the ubie gene encodes a c-methyltransferase required for the synthesis of both coq and menaquinone, and it is the 5' gene in an operon containing ubie, yigp, and ubib.  the data indicate that octaprenylphenol accumulates in an59 as a result of a polar effect of the ubie::is1 mutation on the downstream ubib gene. an59 is complemented by a dna segment containing the contiguous ubie, yigp, and ubib genes. although transformation of an59 with a dna segment containing the ubib coding region fails to restore coq biosynthesis, transformation with the ubie coding region results in a low-frequency but significant rescue attributed to homologous recombination. in addition, the fre gene, previously considered to correspond to ubib, was found not to be involved in coq biosynthesis. the ubib gene is a member of a predicted protein kinase family of which the saccharomyces  cerevisiae abc1 gene is the prototypic member. the possible protein kinase function of ubib and abc1 and the role these polypeptides may play in coq biosynthesis are discussed.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

TI  == a regulatory cascade involving aarg, a putative sensor kinase, controls the expression of the 2'-n-acetyltransferase and an intrinsic multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) response in providencia stuartii.
AB  == a recessive mutation, aarg1, has been identified that resulted in an 18-fold increase in the expression of beta-galactosidase from an aac(2')-lacz fusion. transcriptional fusions and northern blot analysis demonstrated that the aarg1 allele also resulted in a large increase in the expression of aarp, a gene encoding a transcriptional activator of aac(2')-ia. the effects of aarg1 on aac(2')-ia expression were mediated by aarp-dependent and -independent mechanisms. the aarg1 allele also resulted in a multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) phenotype, which included increased chloramphenicol, tetracycline and fluoroquinolone resistance. this mar phenotype also resulted from aarp-dependent  and -independent mechanisms. sequence analysis of the aarg locus revealed the presence of two open reading frames, designated aarr and aarg, organized in tandem. the putative aarr protein displayed 75% amino acid identity to the response regulator phop, and the aarg protein displayed 57% amino acid identity to the sensor kinase phoq. the aarg1 mutation, a c to t substitution, resulted in a threonine to isoleucine substitution at position 279 (t279i) in the putative sensor kinase. the aarg product was functionally similar to phoq, as it was able  to restore wild-type levels of maganin resistance to a salmonella typhimurium phoq mutant. however, expression of the aarp and aac(2')-ia genes was not significantly affected by the levels of mg2+ or ca2+, suggesting that aarg senses a signal other than divalent cations.

AB  == the aare1 allele was identified on the basis of the resulting phenotype of increased aminoglycoside resistance. the aare1 mutation also resulted in a small-colony phenotype and decreased levels of aac(2')-ia mrna. the deduced aare  gene product displayed 61% amino acid identity to the escherichia coli ubia protein, an octaprenyltransferase required for the second step of ubiquinone biosynthesis. complementation experiments in both providencia stuartii and e. coli demonstrated that aare and ubia are functionally equivalent.

TI  == substrate recognition by the leucyl/phenylalanyl-trna-protein transferase. conservation within the enzyme family and localization to the trypsin-resistant domain.
AB  == the leucyl/phenylalanyl-trna-protein transferase (l/f-transferase) from escherichia coli catalyzes a peptidyltransferase reaction that results in the n-terminal aminoacylation of acceptor proteins using leu-, phe-, and met-trnas as amino acid donors. we demonstrated that l/f-transferase homologs are widely distributed throughout the eubacteria, supporting our proposal that the enzyme family is ancient and catalyzes early peptide bond synthesis. however, here we present data suggesting that the l/f-transferase is not a homolog of the peptidyltransferase enzymes involved in cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive species, such as staphylococcus aureus. a sequence comparison of the known l/f-transferase homologs began to identify the essential residues required to catalyze a peptidyltransferase reaction and revealed that <20% of the residues were invariant within the l/f-transferase family. despite this sequence  variation, substrate specificity was broadly conserved, and l/f-transferase homologs from providencia stuartii, vibrio cholerae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. all complemented an e. coli aat mutant (lacking l/f-transferase activity) for the degradation of n-end rule substrates.  in vitro comparison of the most divergent l/f-transferase homologs, from e. coli  and the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp., revealed near-complete conservation of  both substrate specificity and secondary structure. finally, we demonstrated that variants of the e. coli l/f-transferase, lacking either 33 or 78 n-terminal residues, retained measurable peptidyltransferase activity and wild type substrate specificity. overall, our results identified an essential core of an l/f-transferase and revealed that a peptidyltransferase catalyst may be constructed from approximately 120 amino acids.

TI  == identification and characterization of aarf, a locus required for production of ubiquinone in providencia stuartii and escherichia coli and for expression of 2'-n-acetyltransferase in p. stuartii.
AB  == providencia stuartii contains a chromosomal 2'-n-acetyltransferase [aac(2')-ia] involved in the o acetylation of peptidoglycan. the aac(2')-ia enzyme is also capable of acetylating and inactivating certain aminoglycosides and confers high-level resistance to these antibiotics when overexpressed. we report the identification of a locus in p. stuartii, designated aarf, that is required for the expression of aac(2')-ia. northern (rna) analysis demonstrated that aac(2')-ia mrna levels were dramatically decreased in a p. stuartii strain carrying an aarf::cm disruption. the aarf::cm disruption also resulted in a deficiency in the respiratory cofactor ubiquinone. the aarf locus encoded a protein that had a predicted molecular mass of 62,559 da and that exhibited extensive amino acid similarity to the products of two adjacent open reading frames of unknown function (yigq and yigr), located at 86 min on the escherichia  coli chromosome. an e. coli yigr::kan mutant was also deficient in ubiquinone content. complementation studies demonstrated that the aarf and the e. coli yigqr loci were functionally equivalent. the aarf or yigqr genes were unable to complement ubid and ubie mutations that are also present at 86 min on the e. coli chromosome. this result indicates that aarf (yigqr) represents a novel locus for  ubiquinone production and reveals a previously unreported connection between ubiquinone biosynthesis and the regulation of gene expression.

TI  == aarc, an essential gene involved in density-dependent regulation of the 2'-n-acetyltransferase in providencia stuartii.
AB  == the 2'-n-acetyltransferase [aac(2')-ia] in providencia stuartii has a dual function where it is involved in the acetylation of peptidoglycan and certain aminoglycosides. a search for negative regulators of the aac(2')-ia gene has resulted in the identification of aarc. a missense allele (aarc1) resulted in an  8.9-fold increase in beta-galactosidase accumulation from an aac(2')-lacz transcriptional fusion. northern blot analysis demonstrated an increase in aac(2')-ia mrna accumulation that was specific to cells at high density. in addition, the aarc1 allele also resulted in a substantial increase in the expression of aarp, a transcriptional activator of the aac(2')-ia gene. the wild-type aarc gene was isolated by complementation and encodes a predicted protein of 365 amino acids with a molecular mass of 39,815 da. the predicted aarc protein exhibited 88% amino acid homology to the previously identified gcpe protein of escherichia coli and 86% homology to a gene product from haemophilus influenzae. the e. coli gcpe gene was able to functionally complement the aarc1 allele in p. stuartii. the aarc1 allele was identified as a t to g transversion that resulted in a valine to glycine substitution at position 136 in the aarc protein. the aarc gene appears to be essential for cell viability as construction of a disrupted copy (aarc::lacz) was possible only in cells that carried an episomal copy of aarc or gcpe.

TI  == the prevalence of gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in the proteeae and its role  in the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan.
AB  == the prevalence of aac(2')-ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in providencia stuartii, among species of the proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in p. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan o-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. an evaluation of the mics of gentamicin for each of the species of the proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of o-acetylation of peptidoglycan. the entire aac(2')-ia gene was used as a probe in southern hybridization experiments against genomic dna from each species of the proteeae. a sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-ia was present only in proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also  observed to the restriction digested dna from providencia rettgeri. other bacteria that o-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a  homologous dna sequence was only found in neisseria subflava. these data suggest  that aac(2')-ia may contribute to the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan in p. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

TI  == characterization of the chromosomal aminoglycoside 2'-n-acetyltransferase gene from mycobacterium fortuitum.
AB  == a novel gene encoding an aminoglycoside 2'-n-acetyltransferase (aac) was cloned from mycobacterium fortuitum. dna sequencing results identified an open reading frame that we have called aac(2')-ib encoding a putative protein with a predicted molecular mass of 24,800 da. the deduced aac(2')-ib protein showed homology to the aac(2')-ia from providencia stuartii. this is the second member of a subfamily of aac(2')-i enzymes to be identified. no homology was found with other acetyltransferases, including all of the aac(3) and aac(6') proteins. the aac(2')-ib gene cloned in a mycobacterial plasmid and introduced in mycobacterium smegmatis conferred resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, dibekacin, netilmicin,  and 6'-n-ethylnetilmicin. dna hybridization with an intragenic probe of aac(2')-ib showed that this gene was present in all 34 strains of m. fortuitum tested. the universal presence of the aac(2')-ib gene in m. fortuitum was not correlated with any aminoglycoside resistance phenotype, suggesting that this gene may play a role in the secondary metabolism of the bacterium.

TI  == identification and characterization of phon-sf, a gene on the large plasmid of shigella flexneri 2a encoding a nonspecific phosphatase.
AB  == a gene encoding a nonspecific phosphatase, named phon-sf, was identified on the large virulence plasmid (pmysh6000) of shigella flexneri 2a ysh6000. the phosphatase activity in ysh6000 was observed under high-phosphate conditions. however, it was found that low-phosphate conditions induced a slightly higher level of activity. the nucleotide sequence of the phon-sf region cloned from pmysh6000 possessing the phon-sf gene encoded 249 amino acids with a typical signal sequence at the n terminus. the deduced amino acid sequence of the phon-sf protein revealed significant homology to sequences of nonspecific acid phosphatases of other bacteria, such as providencia stuartii (phon, 83.2%), morganella morganii (phoc, 80.6%), salmonella typhimurium (phon, 47.8%), and zymomonas mobilis (phoc, 34.8%). the phon-sf protein was purified, and its biochemical properties were characterized. the apparent molecular mass of the protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was calculated to be 27 kda. the 20 amino acids at the n terminus corresponded to the 20 amino acid residues following the putative signal sequence of phon-sf protein  deduced from the nucleotide sequence. the phon-sf activity had a ph optimum of 6.6, and the optimum temperature was 37 degrees c. the enzymatic activity was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, n-bromosuccinimide, or dithiothreitol but not by edta. the subcellular localization of the phon-sf protein in ysh6000 revealed that the protein was found predominantly in the periplasm. examination of shigella and enteroinvasive escherichia coli strains for phon-sf production by immunoblotting with the phon-specific antibody and for the presence of phon-sf dna by using a phon-sf probe indicated that approximately one-half of the strains possessed the phon-sf gene on the large plasmid and expressed the phon-sf protein. the tn5 insertion mutants of ysh6000 possessing phon-sf::tn5 still retained wild-type levels of invasiveness, as well as the subsequent spreading capacity in mk2 epithelial cell monolayers, thus suggesting that the phon-sf activity is not involved in expression of the virulence phenotypes of shigella strains under in vitro conditions.

AB  == in a search for genes involved in regulation of the 2'-n-acetyltransferase in providencia stuartii, a mini-tn5cm insertion has been isolated in a locus designated aard. the aard1::mini-tn5cm mutation resulted in a 4.7-fold increase in the levels of beta-galactosidase accumulation from an aac(2')-lacz transcriptional fusion and a 32-fold increase in the levels of gentamicin resistance in p. stuartii. the wild-type aard locus was cloned on a 5.0 kb cla i  fragment and complemented the aard1 mutation. nucleotide sequence analysis of this fragment identified two large open reading frames whose deduced products displayed significant amino acid identity, 64% and 64%, respectively, to the cydd and cydc proteins of escherichia coli, which are involved in formation of the cytochrome d oxidase complex. physical mapping indicated the aard1::mini-tn5cm insertion was within the open reading homologous to cydd. the strain containing the aard1 mutation was unable to grow in the presence of toluidine blue or on glycerol minimal media in the presence of zinc, suggesting that aard is functionally equivalent to cydd. additional phenotypes resulting from the aard1 mutation included: altered cell morphology, a reduced growth rate and the inability of cells to grow beyond early log phase. further examination of this phenomenon revealed that the aard1 mutant was unable to grow in the presence of a self-produced extracellular factor(s). this novel phenotype was limited to p. stuartii as e. coli cydd and delta cydab::kan mutants were also sensitive to a self-produced extracellular factor.

TI  == identification and analysis of aarp, a transcriptional activator of the 2'-n-acetyltransferase in providencia stuartii.
AB  == the aarp gene has been identified in a search for activators of the 2-n-acetyltransferase [encoded by aac(2')-ia] in providencia stuartii. introduction of aarp into p. stuartii on a multicopy plasmid resulted in a 9.9-fold increase in the accumulation of beta-galactosidase from an aac(2')-lacz  fusion. northern (rna) blot analysis demonstrated that this increased aac(2')-ia  expression occurred at the level of mrna accumulation. the deduced aarp protein was 15,898 da in size and exhibited significant homology to a number of transcriptional activators in the arac/xyis family, including tetd,rob, mara, and soxs. the similarity of aarp to the mara and soxs proteins prompted an investigation to determine whether aarp is involved in activation of genes in either the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) phenotype or redox stress (soxrs) system. introduction of aarp on a multicopy plasmid into either p. stuartii or escherichia coli conferred a mar phenotype with higher levels of resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and ciprofloxacin. multiple copies of aarp in e. coli also resulted in activation of the endonuclease iv gene (nfo), a gene in the soxrs regulon of e. coli. the function of aarp in its single-copy state was addressed by using allelic replacement to construct an aarp::cm disruption, which resulted in a fivefold reduction in the accumulation of aac(2')-ia mrna. analysis of aarp regulation showed that aarp mrna accumulation was slightly increased by exposure to tetracycline and dramatically increased in cells containing the aarb3 (aar3) mutation, which was previously shown to increase transcription of the aac(2')-ia gene.

TI  == effect of salicylate on expression of flagella by escherichia coli and proteus, providencia, and pseudomonas spp.
AB  == osmotic stress, salicylate, and mar (multiple antibiotic resistance) mutation are known to block the expression of the ompf porin. since these conditions have also been shown to inhibit the expression of p and cfa fimbriae in escherichia coli, we speculated that they might affect the expression of flagella as well. hyperosmotic conditions have been shown to block the synthesis of flagellin and expression of flagella in e. coli (c. li, c. j. louise, w. shi, and j. adler, j.  bacteriol. 175:2229-2235, 1993). in the current study, sodium salicylate was found to inhibit the motility of e. coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner. swarming did not occur at 20 mm sodium salicylate. salicylate also blocked the synthesis of flagellin in e. coli. phenotypic mar mutants of e. coli derived from motile strains were amotile. flagella were markedly reduced as determined by scanning electron microscopy when p. mirabilis was grown in broth containing 20 mm salicylate. salicylate had no apparent effect, however, on expression of a 40-kda porin protein in p. mirabilis. this finding suggests that the noted effect of salicylate on proteus spp. may be mediated through a mechanism other than porin production or that the  proteus porin may not be analogous to ompf in e. coli. salicylate decreased the motility of pseudomonas cepacia but had no effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa. the  exact mechanism by which salicylate exerts its effect is not known, but it appears to be related to osmoregulation.

AB  == a laboratory model system was developed to investigate the progressive colonization of urinary catheters by escherichia coli providencia stuartii, prominent organisms in the polymicrobial bacteriuria of the long-term catheterized urinary tract. we hypothesized that colonization of the catheter and artificial urine by e. coli is influenced by the presence of p. stuartii. e. coli or p. stuartii in pure culture both rapidly colonized the artificial urine and catheters, and both persisted throughout all experiments. in systems containing both organisms, p. stuartii occurred in significantly higher numbers in the artificial urine and on the catheters than e. coli (p < 0.05). to obtain similar  numbers of e. coli and p. stuartii in the artificial urine, citrate was eliminated; however, p. stuartii still dominated on the catheter surfaces. the presence of p. stuartii appeared to facilitate growth of e. coli in the artificial urine, yet reduce numbers of e. coli on the catheter. in a separate experiment using different strains of e. coli and p. stuartii, the latter was dominant in the artificial urine and on the catheter surfaces. however, this strain of p. stuartii (which was urease positive) did not facilitate growth of e. coli. the interaction between these strains may have been considerably affected by urea hydrolysis, which resulted in an increase in ph (6.5 to > 8.5) and considerable precipitate formation in the model system. the paradox of p. stuartii enhancing colonization by e. coli in the artificial urine, yet inhibiting its colonization on the catheter surface, illustrates the complexity of polymicrobial interactions in colonization of the catheterized urinary tract.

AB  == ureolytic clinical isolates of providencia stuartii, salmonella spp., and some escherichia coli strains contain large urease-encoding plasmids. expression of urease activity from these isolates is induced at least 20-fold by urea. in order to facilitate studies on the regulatory mechanism controlling this urea-inducible expression, the plasmid-encoded urease genes were inserted into the low-copy-number vector prk415, to form psef70. deletion mutagenesis of psef70 demonstrated that between 1.3 and 1.6 kb of dna upstream of ured (the first of seven urease genes clustered in an operon-like fashion) was required for a urease-positive phenotype. an open reading frame coding for a 34.1-kda polypeptide was found in the dna sequence of this upstream region. this open reading frame has been designated urer, for urease regulator. a urea-inducible promoter region was identified upstream of ured. transcription from this promoter was activated only when urer was present in trans. the predicted urer gene product contains a helix-turn-helix motif and shows significant amino acid similarity to the arac family of transcriptional activators. we conclude that urea-dependent expression from the plasmid-encoded urease gene cluster requires urer and that urer codes for a positive regulatory element controlling transcription of at least one essential urease gene, ured.

AB  == purple urine bag syndrome is a rare phenomenon in which bags turns purple or blue following catheterization. this phenomenon was reported to occur by providencia stuartii in the presence of indicanuria. we reported herein three females above 75 years of age having a similar phenomenon. all were bedridden chronically and constipated. in these cases, no growth of p. stuartii was found on repeated urine culture, but escherichia coli and morganella morganii were concomitantly isolated during the blue bags. it is suggested that purple urine bag syndrome develops in  a combination of e. coli and m. morganii besides p. stuartii.

TI  == rapid access to pharmacokinetics data and correlation between antimicrobial susceptibility results and drug tissue distribution using a personal computer.
AB  == mymic is a computer-aided system capable of integrating antibiotic susceptibility data with the concentrations the drugs reach in various body tissues and fluids by calculating site concentration/minimal inhibitory concentration quotients. the program can be run on any low-cost personal computer operating under ms-dos, provided it is equipped with a hard-disk drive and with a minimum of 512 kilobytes of random access memory. the use of the program does not require any knowledge of computer languages. the antibiotic susceptibility data can be entered either as minimal inhibitory concentrations or as inhibitory zone diameters; in the latter case, minimal inhibitory concentrations are automatically calculated via regression formulas. the concentrations obtained by  90 antibiotics in 51 different human tissues and fluids are recorded in a data base of over 1,000 records, obtained from roughly 700 original papers. a mymic sample session was simulated by mimicking infections of three different body districts (namely bone, prostate, and sputum) caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli or providencia stuartii.

TI  == bsubi--an isospecific restriction and modification system of psti: characterization of the bsubi genes and enzymes.
AB  == the enzymes of the bacillus subtilis bsubi restriction/modification (r/m) system  recognize the target sequence 5'ctgcag. the genes of the bsubi r/m system have been cloned and sequenced and their products have been characterized following overexpression and purification. the gene of the bsubi dna methyltransferase (m.bsubi) consists of 1503 bp, encoding a protein of 501 amino acids with a calculated m(r) of 57.2 kd. the gene of the restriction endonuclease (r.bsubi), comprising 948 bp, codes for a protein of 316 amino acids with a predicted m(r) of 36.2 kd. m.bsubi modifies the adenine (a) residue of the bsubi target site, thus representing the first a-n6-dna methyltransferase identified in b. subtilis. like r.psti, r.bsubi cleaves between the a residue and the 3' terminal g of the target site. both enzymes of the bsubi r/m system are, therefore, functionally identical with those of the psti r/m system, encoded by the gram negative species providencia stuartii. this functional equivalence coincides with a pronounced similarity of the bsubi/psti dna methyltransferases (41% amino acid identity) and restriction endonucleases (46% amino acid identity). since the genes are also very similar (58% nucleotide identity), the bsubi and psti r/m systems apparently have a common evolutionary origin. in spite of the sequence conservation the gene organization is strikingly different in the two r/m systems. while the genes of the psti r/m system are separated and transcribed divergently, the genes of the bsubi r/m system are transcribed in the same direction, with the 3' end of the m  gene overlapping the 5' end of the r gene by 17 bp.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

TI  == horizontal transfer of a phosphatase gene as evidence for mosaic structure of the salmonella genome.
AB  == the genomes of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium are similar with respect to base composition, chromosome size, and the order, orientation and spacing of genes, but differ with respect to some 29 'loops', regions unique to one species. to evaluate the genetic basis for the structure and organization of  the enteric bacterial genomes, we examined the gene encoding a non-specific acid  phosphatase (phon) which maps to a loop at 96 min on the s.typhimurium chromosome. we detected atypical base composition, codon usage pattern and trinucleotide frequencies. the 1.4 kb region containing phon had an overall base  composition of 43% g+c, while the g+c content at the third positions of codons in the phon reading frame is only 39%, much lower than the salmonella chromosome which averages 52%. non-specific acid phosphatase activity, assayed in 14 gram-negative species, was detected only in morganella morganii and providencia stuartii, organisms with low genomic g+c contents. upstream of the phon gene in salmonella is a sequence with high similarity to the orit region of incfii plasmids, suggesting that the phon gene, and perhaps the entire loop structure, was acquired by lateral transmission in a plasmid-mediated event.

AB  == the clinical features, microbiological characteristics, and outcomes of 163 episodes of bacteremia occurring at a long-term-care facility were evaluated. the rate of nosocomial bacteremia increased from 0.20 to 0.36 cases/1,000 patient-days from 1985 to 1989; there was a parallel increase in the rate of all  nosocomial infections combined. bacteremia was documented in 6.5% of all hospital-acquired infections. the majority of isolates were gram-negative, and providencia stuartii was the most common gram-negative species. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent isolate; one-third of s. aureus strains were resistant to methicillin. bacteremia was polymicrobial in 36 episodes (22%), 14 of which involved an enterococcal species. portals of entry included the urinary  tract (55%), the respiratory tract (11%), and soft tissue (9%). overall mortality was 21.5%. death was significantly associated with residence on the intermediate-care unit, the presence of a respiratory infection, a change in mental status, and relatively recent admission. optimal management of bacterial infection in a long-term-care setting requires the availability of blood culture  results. initial decisions about antibiotic therapy should be made in light of the likelihood of infection with multiresistant organisms and of polymicrobial infection.

TI  == studies to optimize the in vitro testing of piperacillin combined with tazobactam (ytr 830).
AB  == the combination of piperacillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (formerly ytr 830) was studied to determine optimal disk concentrations and dilution testing conditions. in addition, the potency of the combination was compared to that of piperacillin alone. the spectrum of piperacillin was greatly  expanded by the addition to tazobactam principally against beta-lactamase producing strains of haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii, shigella spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus spp. tazobactam was active alone against branhamella catarrhalis (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] 50, less than or  equal to 1 microgram/ml), gonococci (mic 50, 0.5-4 micrograms/ml), and n. meningitidis (mic 50, less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml). studies with beta-lactamase-producing type strains showed tazobactam to have high affinity for plasmid-mediated enzymes (tem-1 and 2, shv-1, hms-1, and some carb or oxa types)  and not chromosomal beta-lactamases. piperacillin/tazobactam inhibited 93% of fluoro-quinolone resistant strains at less than or equal to 64/8 micrograms/ml but failed to suppress the growth of 15 strains producing stably depressed cephalosporinases. comparisons of piperacillin/tazobactam results determined with 100/10-, 100/20-, and 100/30-micrograms disks established the 100/10-micrograms disk as most usable. among five different mic combinations the ratio of eight parts piperacillin to one part tazobactam or fixed concentration tests at greater than or equal to 4 micrograms tazobactam/ml were preferred, each producing very low occurrences (less than or equal to 1.6%) of false-resistance or -susceptibility when compared to disk test results. mics determined by agar and broth microdilution methods were essentially the same. the recommended breakpoints for piperacillin/tazobactam mics were identical to those now found in the nccls susceptibility testing standards with the following exceptions: (1) for tests with h. influenzae and staphylococcus spp.--susceptible at greater than or  equal to 21 mm (mic less than or equal to 16/2 micrograms/ml) and resistant less  than or equal to 20 mm (mic less or equal to 32/4 micrograms/ml); and (2) all remaining nonspeudomonas isolates would be interpreted by the nccls piperacillin  enteric bacilli susceptibility criteria. this newer beta-lactamase inhibitor combination appears to be worthy of further in vivo trials guided by these or similar tentative in vitro susceptibility testing parameters.

TI  == comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == a total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis.  however, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of s. aureus and s. epidermidis. for escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against  pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == interaction of the bisbiguanides chlorhexidine and alexidine with phospholipid vesicles: evidence for separate modes of action.
AB  == strains of providencia stuartii with demonstrated resistance towards chlorhexidine did not show such resistance towards either of the related biguanide antiseptics, alexidine or vantocil. alexidine promoted a significantly  faster alteration in the permeability of escherichia coli cell membranes towards  various metal cations than chlorhexidine. differential thermal analysis of various mixed lipid vesicles and pure phospholipid vesicles showed alexidine to share with vantocil the property of producing lipid phase separation and domain formation. it is suggested that the nature of the end-group on the biguanides affects the ability to produce lipid domains in cell membranes and this this might, in turn, affect activity and resistance patterns observed.

TI  == proteus mirabilis urease: genetic organization, regulation, and expression of structural genes.
AB  == proteus mirabilis, a cause of serious urinary tract infection, produces urease, an important virulence factor for this species. the enzyme hydrolyzes urea to co2 and nh3, which initiates struvite or apatite stone formation. genes encoding urease were localized on a p. mirabilis chromosomal dna gene bank clone in escherichia coli by deletion analysis, subcloning, bal31 nuclease digestion, transposon tn5 mutagenesis, and in vitro transcription-translation. a region of dna between 4.0 and 5.4 kilobases (kb) in length was necessary for urease activity and was located within an 18.5-kb ecori fragment. the operon was induced by urea and encoded a multimeric, cytoplasmic enzyme comprising subunit polypeptides of 8,000, 10,000, and 73,000 daltons that were encoded by a single polycistronic mrna and transcribed in that order. seventeen urease-negative transposon insertions were isolated that synthesized either none of the structural subunit polypeptides, the 8,000-dalton polypeptide alone, or both the  8,000- and 10,000-dalton subunit polypeptides. the molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 212,000 by superose-6 chromatography. homologous sequences encoding the urease of providencia stuartii synthesized subunit polypeptides of similar sizes and showed a similar genetic arrangement. however,  restriction maps of the operons from the two species were distinct, indicating significant divergence.

TI  == purification, characterization, and genetic organization of recombinant providencia stuartii urease expressed by escherichia coli.
AB  == recombinant urease from providencia stuartii has been expressed in and purified from escherichia coli, and the genetic organization of the structural genes has been determined. urease expression was induced by urea and repressed by nitrogen-rich components in the medium. the urease protein was purified 331-fold  by deae-sepharose, phenyl-sepharose, mono-q, and phenyl-superose chromatographies with a 7.3% yield. the enzyme possessed a km for urea of 9.3 mm and hydrolyzed urea at a vmax of 7,100 mumol/min per mg. p. stuartii urease is composed of three polypeptides (mrs, 73,000, 10,0000, and 9,000) denoted by alpha, beta, and gamma. the native enzyme is best described as (alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2)2, based on a native mr of 230,000, obtained by gel filtration chromatography, and on the coomassie blue staining intensities of the individual subunits. atomic absorption analysis of the pure protein revealed 1.9 +/- 0.1 nickel ions per alpha 1 beta 2  gamma 2 unit. in vitro transcription-translation analysis of transposon insertion mutants of the recombinant urease demonstrated that the urease peptides are encoded on adjacent dna sequences and transcribed as a polycistronic mrna in the  order gamma, beta, and then alpha. three urease-defective insertion mutants were  identified that did not affect synthesis of urease subunit polypeptides, indicating that some nickel processing, enzyme activation, or other function may  also be necessary for producing an active urease.

TI  == assessment of antiseptic bladder washout procedures using a physical model of the catheterised bladder.
AB  == a simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. the activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with edta + tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. except for phenoxyethanol against pv. stuartii and possibly ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. however, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate ps. aeruginosa. it is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.

TI  == fractionation of the providencia stuartii cell envelope.
AB  == cell envelopes (i.e. unfractionated inner and outer membranes) were obtained from providencia stuartii by following procedures previously applied to the isolation  of envelopes from escherichia coli. the p. stuartii envelopes contained known inner membrane enzymes that included a variety of dehydrogenases and atpase. the  catalytic activity of the atpase depended upon the concentration of magnesium ions, the substrate (atp) level and the ratio of magnesium ions to atp. cell envelopes from p. stuartii were further fractionated to recover inner and outer membrane polypeptides by treatment with the detergent sarkosyl. proteins from the periplasmic region were recovered by a simple osmotic shock procedure also previously applied to e. coli. the purity of the various p. stuartii cell envelope fractions was assessed by a combination of techniques that included one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins, enzyme assays and detection  of penicillin-binding proteins.

TI  == the resistance of urinary tract pathogens to chlorhexidine bladder washouts.
AB  == isolates of providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. all species survived the antiseptic. organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. the effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. we conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate  established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefixime and six other agents against nosocomial pathogens of the enterobacteriaceae family.
AB  == cefixime, a broad-spectrum, orally active cephalosporin, was more active in vitro than ampicillin, cefaclor, cephalothin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole against 194 nosocomial pathogens of the family enterobacteriaceae. activity was especially good against klebsiella spp, proteus spp, serratia spp, and providencia stuartii. although gentamicin had equivalent or better activity against citrobacter spp, enterobacter spp, escherichia coli, and morganella morganii, all 23 of the gentamicin-resistant strains studied were susceptible to  cefixime. isolates tested were from urinary tract infections, abdominal infections, wounds, vascular infections, and respiratory infections; they were sequentially collected nosocomial pathogens from a single institution. this orally active cephalosporin should be considered for therapy of a variety of nosocomial infections involving gram-negative bacillary pathogens.

TI  == prevalence of colonization with antibiotic resistant gram-negative bacilli in a nursing home care unit: the importance of cross-colonization as documented by plasmid analysis.
AB  == a prevalence study was carried out on a 100-bed veterans administration nursing home care unit to determine the extent of colonization with gentamicin-resistant  gram-negative bacilli (grgnb). hand cultures of 12 employees and 17 environmental cultures were negative. twenty-six of 86 (30%) patients were colonized with 49 grgnb. sixteen patients (19%) had urinary colonization. multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between rectal or perineal colonization (p less than 0.01), and the presence of a urinary device (82% condom catheters) (p less than 0.05), with urinary colonization. the most common isolates were providencia  stuartii (20), escherichia coli (nine) and klebsiella pneumoniae (nine). twenty-six of 49 isolates carried plasmids. restriction endonuclease digestion of plasmid dna was performed for 21. cross-colonization, as defined by the presence  of the identical species with the identical restriction endonuclease digestion profile of purified plasmid dna found in different patients, was observed for eight of 21 (38%) strains. all were geographically clustered. no strains could transfer gentamicin-resistance by conjugation and only two plasmids could transform our e coli recipient to gentamicin resistance. one e coli plasmid was identical to two citrobacter freundii plasmids and a p stuartii plasmid isolated  from three different patients. this 105 kb plasmid is conjugative and encodes resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin, tetracycline, and sulfonamides. thus, 57% of strains were cross-colonizing or contained identical r-plasmids. southern  hybridization using a 1 kb tem-1 gene probe demonstrated sequences homologous to  this probe in five of five nursing home plasmids examined.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == do clinical microbiology laboratories report complete bacteriology in urine from  patients with long-term urinary catheters?
AB  == bacteriuria associated with long-term urinary catheters (those in place for greater than or equal to 30 days) appears to be the most common nosocomial infection in u.s. medical care facilities. this bacteriuria is polymicrobial and  dynamic and accompanied by fevers, catheter obstructions, bacteremias, and deaths. we compared the reporting by our research laboratory of bacteria present  in urine from long-term-catheterized nursing home patients with that by two commercial laboratories. the commercial laboratories isolated significantly fewer bacterial species at 10(5) cfu/ml of urine specimen. organisms well recognized as causes of urinary tract infections in noncatheterized patients (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae) were isolated in comparable frequencies by both the research and commercial laboratories. however, other organisms, including uncommon uropathogens like providencia stuartii and morganella morganii, which were actually among the most frequent bacteriuric species in these long-term-catheterized patients, were isolated significantly less frequently by the commercial laboratories. reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may involve use of different techniques. more complete reporting may  lead to better understanding of the polymicrobial bacteriuria of long-term catheters and its associated complications. this, in turn, may result in improved patient care and infection control in nursing homes.

TI  == providencia stuartii: a common cause of antibiotic-resistant bacteriuria in patients with long-term indwelling catheters.
AB  == the long-term-catheterized urinary tract may offer a particular niche to providencia stuartii, which is otherwise an uncommon clinical isolate. published  accounts of bacteriuria in patients catheterized for long periods indicate that p. stuartii has often been found as frequently as familiar uropathogens such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. as in most nosocomial infections, the frequency of isolation of a given species has  commonly differed among institutions. in the future p. stuartii may be more frequently encountered as a nosocomial pathogen in nursing homes and in acute care hospitals to which bacteriuric patients are transferred. this trend appears  likely because of the increasingly large nursing-home population, the predilection of the bacterium for the long-term-catheterized urinary tract, the opportunity for nosocomial transmission from this reservoir, the resistance of the organism to multiple antibiotics, and the occasional systemic illness and bacteremia caused by p. stuartii.

AB  == timentin (ticarcillin (tcr) + clavulanic acid (ac)) was given for severe bacterial infections to sixteen hospitalized patients (10 male and 6 female; 16 to 75 years of age; normal renal function in 12). infections included 8 septicemias (of which 4 were secondary to pyelonephritis), 6 pyelonephritis (in addition to the four above-mentioned cases), and 3 suppurated cellulitis of the lower limbs (with septicemia in one case). the following bacteria were recovered: 10 escherichia coli, 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 1 providencia stuartii, 1 salmonella typhi, 1 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 staphylococcus aureus. the sixteen strains were all susceptible to timentin (mics determined by agar dilution: tcr + ac 4 mg/l: 0.5-16 mg/l; tcr + ac 8 mg/l: 0.2-16 mg/l). thirteen strains were susceptible to tcr (mic less than or equal to 16 mg/l), and three (1 e. coli, 1 k. pneumoniae, and 1 s. aureus) were resistant  to tcr (mic greater than or equal to 256 mg/l). 14 patients received timentin alone, while two were also given dibekacin. timentin was given in one-hour iv infusions in a dosage of 9.6 g/24 h (3.2 g x 3) in 10 patients and 6.4 g/24 h (3.2 g x 2) in 6. duration of therapy was 14 to 16 days in half of cases (range 5 to 21 days). at termination of the infusion, serum concentrations of ticarcillin  and clavulanic acid (determined in ten patients) were greater than 50 mg/l and 3-7.4 mg/l respectively, and serum bactericidal activity (evaluated in ten cases) was consistently less than 1/2.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == evolution of an r plasmid from a cryptic plasmid by transposition of two copies of tn1 in providencia stuartii.
AB  == examination of a series of isolates of providencia stuartii collected over an 18  month period from a chronic-care patient at bristol royal infirmary revealed the  emergence of resistance to carbenicillin. resistance was mediated by a 47 kb plasmid which transferred by conjugation to a plasmid-free strain of p. stuartii  but not to escherichia coli. carbenicillin-sensitive isolates were either plasmid-free or contained a 36 kb cryptic plasmid. restriction endonuclease mapping of this plasmid showed it to be closely related to 32 kb and 34 kb cryptic plasmids reported previously in p. stuartii from bristol. mapping of the  r plasmid showed it to be derived from the 34 kb cryptic plasmid by transposition of two copies of tn1.

TI  == clinical evaluation of temocillin in urinary tract infections.
AB  == a group of 27 female and 2 male urological patients, aged 19 to 80 years (mean 44 years), were treated with intravenous temocillin 500 mg twice daily for 5 to 7 days. the diagnoses were acute pyelonephritis (n = 20), acute cystitis (n = 6), and acute cystitis and pyelonephritis combined (3). the causative organisms were  escherichia coli (n = 20). proteus species (n = 9). klebsiella species (n = 4). streptococcus faecalis (n = 2). staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 1), and providencia stuartii (n = 1). 27 of the 29 patients (93%) were clinically and bacteriologically cured; bacteriuria persisted in 2 patients with prolonged obstructive uropathy. in acute non-obstructive pyelonephritis, the urinary excretion of beta-2-microglobulin rapidly decreased, documenting a prompt renal tubular restitution during therapy. the drug was well tolerated and proved very safe with regard to haematological, hepatic and renal parameters. also, candida haemagglutination titres did not increase significantly during therapy. temocillin therapy should preferably be commenced after the results of the urine  culture are available.

TI  == detection of pse-2 beta-lactamase in enterobacteria.
AB  == pse-2, a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase which was previously considered pseudomonas specific, was observed in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, and enterobacter cloacae. all four isolates transferred pse-2 production, together with resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and sulfamethoxazole, into escherichia coli j62-1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21. transfer correlated with acquisition by the transconjugants of a 65-megadalton plasmid, and this element was considered to encode pse-2 expression. the pse-2 enzyme conferred high-level carbenicillin resistance on both j62-1 and pu21 transconjugants, although the pse-2-producing providencia stuartii isolate was susceptible to carbenicillin.

AB  == the recently updated ms-2 bacterial identification system software (abbott laboratories, diagnostic division, irving, tex.) was compared with the original ms-2 bacterial identification software and the api 20e, using 968 strains of enterobacteriaceae. the updated ms-2 software correctly identified 94.4% of the isolates tested. api 20e and the original ms-2 software correctly identified 91 and 85.3% of the strains, respectively. ms-2 responses were considered to be equivocal (needing additional tests for verification) if the percent likelihood values were less than 80%. the percentage of equivocal responses was reduced from 6.5% with the original software to 2.2% with the updated software, and the percentage of incorrect identifications was reduced from 8.2 to 3.4% with the original and updated software, respectively. organisms belonging to 25 taxonomic  groups were tested. direct comparison of the two ms-2 programs showed that the updated ms-2 software increased the identification accuracy of salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, providencia stuartii, escherichia coli, shigella spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter  calcoaceticus. a decrease in accuracy was seen with citrobacter freundii, hafnia  alvei, enterobacter agglomerans, and yersinia pseudotuberculosis when the updated software was used. the remaining 12 taxonomic groups were not affected by the software changes. the updated ms-2 software appears to significantly improve the  identification accuracy of the ms-2 bacterial identification system.

TI  == plasmid pattern analysis of natural bacterial isolates and its epidemiological implication.
AB  == natural isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and providencia stuartii were analysed to determine their plasmid content. this data allowed the identification of nosocomial strains of k. pneumoniae and p. stuartii and helped in the differentiation of epidemic strains  of e. coli 0111 and s. typhimurium. phenotypically similar isolates of s. typhimurium could be shown to be of independent origin using plasmid pattern analysis. the dissemination of a particular plasmid through different strains of  s. typhimurium resulted in a simulation of a very widely distributed epidemic strain, because the plasmid interfered with the phage type of its host strain in  addition to determining resistance properties. plasmid pattern analysis disclosed two independently existing but interacting epidemic processes: a bacterial 'epidemic' strain may become disseminated over a large territory and may predominate there for a long time; a single plasmid, however, may also become distributed through many different bacterial strains and may spread over a large  territory. plasmid pattern analysis provides a valuable and universal epidemiological laboratory method.

TI  == a prospective microbiologic study of bacteriuria in patients with chronic indwelling urethral catheters.
AB  == bacteriuria is common in chronically catheterized patients and is associated with both acute and chronic complications. of 605 consecutive weekly urine specimens from 20 chronically catheterized patients, 98% contained bacteria at high concentrations and 77% were polymicrobial. the mean interval between new episodes of bacteriuria was 1.8 weeks. most species of bacteria caused five to seven new episodes of bacteriuria per 100 weeks of catheterization. even though access to the catheter lumen was similar, the duration of bacteriuric episodes varied greatly by species. of the episodes of bacteriuria caused by nonenterococcal gram-positive cocci, greater than 75% lasted less than one week. mean durations of episodes of bacteriuria due to escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were four to six weeks, whereas those due to providencia stuartii averaged 10 weeks and ranged up to 36 weeks. thus, the very high prevalence of bacteriuria--virtually 100%--was a result of a high incidence caused by many different species combined with the prolonged residence of some gram-negative bacilli in the catheter and urinary tract.

TI  == cloning and expression of the pst i restriction-modification system in escherichia coli.
AB  == here we report the cloning and preliminary characterization of the pst i restriction-modification system of providencia stuartii 164. transformants of escherichia coli carrying the pst i gene system inserted into the cloning vector  pbr322 were selected on the basis of acquired resistance to bacteriophage lambda  infection. pst i endonuclease was detected in osmotic shock fluid from each of the resistant clones. plasmid and chromosomal dna from these clones could not be  digested by pst i, indicating that the gene for the corresponding modification enzyme had also been cloned and was being expressed. the smallest recombinant plasmid encoding both activities, ppst201, contains an insert of approximately 4000 base pairs. in vitro transcription studies indicate that this dna fragment also contains the endogenous promoter(s) of the system. when ppst201 was introduced into a minicell-producing strain of e. coli, two new proteins, 32,000  and 35,000 daltons, were synthesized. we have assigned these to the pst i modification (methylase) and restriction enzymes, respectively. the active form of the restriction enzyme is a dimer, as determined by gel filtration. constructed transformants of p. stuartii 164 that carry the pst i system inserted into pbr322 produce approximately 10 times more pst i endonuclease activity than  does the native strain.

AB  == a total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. these strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, ly127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (hr 756), and cefoperazone (t 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the  same hospital in 1979. susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two  nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins  and other effective antibiotics. the agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. the multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. both klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935 and cefotaxime. p. aeruginosa  (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. all three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., and citrobacter spp. providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935. the three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to  ly127935. none of the three new beta-lactams was active against s. faecalis. all  were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae.

TI  == comparative bactericidal effect of ceforanide (bl-s 786) and five other cephalosporins in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of ceforanide was compared, in an in vitro kinetic model, with that of five other cephalosproins: cephalothin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin. cultures of various pathogens in 95% human serum were incubated for 12 hours in the presence of the cephalosporins whose concentrations were modified periodically-by addition of a concentrated solution of drug or dilution with unmedicated serum-in order to simulate the variation of antibiotic concentration in human blood after one-gram intramuscular dose. one gram-positive strain and six gram-negative strains were used. bactericidal activity was assessed by monitoring changes in the number of colony-forming units. tests showed that against klebsiella pneumoniae, ceforanide was the most active of the six cephalosporins. proteus mirabilis was more susceptible to ceforanide and cefuroxime than to the other compounds; enterobacter cloacae to ceforanide, cefuroxime, and cefamandole; escherichia coli to ceforanide, cefuroxime, cefamandole, and cefazolin. the number of viable cells of staphylococcus aureus was reduced below detectable levels by all cephalosporins except cefoxitin. on the other hand, providencia stuartii was virtually unaffected by all of the cephalosporins except cefoxitin.

TI  == hr 756, a highly active cephalosporin: comparison with cefazolin and carbenicillin.
AB  == hr 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus spp. (indole positive), enterobacter spp., salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, providencia stuartii, and staphylococcus aureus. in every comparison, except that with the last organism, hr 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. all three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, hr 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. hr 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of streptococcus pyogenes,  lancefield group d streptococci, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against bacteriodes fragilis.  hr 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of  these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. hr 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against s. pyogenes; against lancefield group d,  penicillin was 32 times as active as hr 756. hr 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (p. aeruginosa and group d streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. a series of seven transfers of selected strains of e. coli, klebsiella spp., s. aureus, and p. aeruginosa through medium containing hr 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. resistance to hr 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.

TI  == simultaneous production of two types of beta-lactamase in escherichia coli and providencia stuartii.
AB  == the production of beta-lactamase has been studied in two strains isolated from clinical samples: providencia stuartii mulb 501 and escherichia coli mulb 130. these strains were selected for their high resistance level to penicillins and cephalosporins. determination and identification of beta-lactamase activity were  achieved by combining several up-to-date methods including (i) neutralization by  anti-beta-lactamase sera, (ii) purification by affinity chromatography on cephalosporin c linked sepharose 4b, (iii) determination of substrate specificity and kinetic values (km and vmax) by a computerized microacidimetric method, and (iv) isoelectric focusing. the results clearly demonstrate that in these two strains there is a simultaneous production of different beta-lactamases: the first one is similar to the tem penicillinase and the second one shares a typical cephalosporinase profile. this double beta-lactamase production is a relatively rare phenomenon.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of five nitrofurans.
AB  == five nitrofurans- nitrofurantoin, nifuratel, nitrofurazone, furazolidone and and  sq 18,506--have been tested against 201 microbial strains. escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, micrococci and staphylococcus epidermidis were sensitive  to all five compounds; furazolidone and sq 18,506 were the most active against these species. klebsiella aerogenes was less sensitive, and proteus spp., providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant. nifuratel was inhibitory for some candida albicans strains, and sq 18,506 was highly active against this species. nifuratel was judged overall to have superior in vitro antimicrobial properties to nitrofurantoin.

TI  == hand-washing degerming: a comparison of povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine.
AB  == two antiseptic preparations for hand washing were compared by the glove-juice method in a crossover study on 10 volunteers. the reference preparation was 7.5%  povidone-iodine (betadine surgical scrub); the test agent was 4% chlorhexidine gluconate combined with 4% isopropyl alcohol (hibiclens). the experimental model  included inoculation of the hands with a mixture of serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, providentia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reference preparation achieved a reduction ratio in colony counts of 695 to 1 under the conditions of this study. the average postwash colony count after use of 7.5% povidone-iodine was significantly less than the preinoculation colony count. logarithmic values, and the paired t test applied to them, showed a highly significant difference (p = less than 0.001) in favor of the degerming ability of the reference agent compared to the test agent. these data are of value in the selection of preparations for hand washing and may point the way to quantitative  methods for other degerming studies.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of cephalothin-resistant enterobacteriaceae to cefoxitin  and bl-s786.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of two agents relatively resistant to beta-lactamases, bl-s786 and cefoxitin, was tested against 123 recent different clinical isolates of cephalothin-resistant enterobacteriaceae. bl-s786 showed considerable activity against escherichia coli and lesser activity against klebsiella pneumoniae with, respectively, 68% and 41% inhibited at 32 microng/ml. cefoxitin showed more activity in vitro against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, serratia  marcescens and providencia stuartii. cefoxitin appears to be a more promising agent for treating infections caused by cephalothin-resistant enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  == several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. the following species: proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, providencia stuartii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -ii. several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.

TI  == sensitivity of providence to antiseptics and disinfectants.
AB  == seventy isolates of providence were obtained from urinary tract infections in patients from five hospitals. they were all identified as providence b (providencia stuartii). a typing system was devised for these organisms based on  their production of and sensitivity to bacteriophage and bacteriocins. using this system, 27 distinct strains were recognized, and it was clear that many patients  had been infected with the same strain. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of  six antiseptics and disinfectants for these strains were determined. many of the  strains were up to 300-fold more resistant to the cationic antiseptics chlorhexidine, cetrimide, and resiguard than the control strain escherichia coli  nctc 10418. the sensitivities of the providence strains to hycolin, glutaraldehyde, and phenyl mercuric nitrate, however, were similar to those of the control organism. there were significant correlations between the sensitivities of the strains to the three cationic antiseptics. the loss of chlorhexidine resistance from a providence strain after exposure of the cells to  n-methyl-n' nitro n nitrosoguanidine resulted in a concomitant loss of resistance to cetrimide and resiguard, but there was no significant increase in the sensitivity of the mutants to the other three antibacterials.

TI  == formation of crystalline deposits by several genera of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == several species of bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae formed crystalline materials containing calcium when grown in a defined culture medium. enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, and c. intermedius produced calcium pyrophosphate crystals. edwardsiella tarda and escherichia coli formed calcite iii crystals, whereas proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens produced hydroxyapatite crystals. several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with kidney stones, indicating that microorganisms may be involved in the enucleation  process of kidney stone formation.

TI  == in vitro activity of bl-s640 against gram-negative bacilli and staphylococcus aureus compared with activity of four other semisynthetic cephalosporins.
AB  == the in vitro activity of bl-s640 (cefatrizine) was determined against 674 recent  clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus and enterobacteriaceae. activity against s. aureus was less than that of cephapirin, cephalothin, and cefazolin, but greater than that of cephalexin. activity against gram-negative isolates was  variable: bl-s640 was slightly less potent than cefazolin against escherichia coli and klebsiella, but more active than the other compounds. as for the more resistant gram-negative genera, bl-s640 was significantly superior to the control cephalosporins. the effect of inoculum size on the antibacterial activity was moderate for most organisms except enterobacter, providencia stuartii, and indole-positive proteus, the median minimal inhibitory concentrations of which were 6 to 27 times lower when determined with a 10(-4)-diluted culture compared with the undiluted one. the stability in aqueous solution at 37 c was remarkably  high at the lower ph values, but low at the neutral point.
