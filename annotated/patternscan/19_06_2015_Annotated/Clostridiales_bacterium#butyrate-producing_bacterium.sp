TI  == structure of the gut microbiome following colonization with human feces determines colonic tumor burden.
AB  == background: a growing body of evidence indicates that the gut microbiome plays a  role in the development of colorectal cancer (crc). patients with crc harbor gut  microbiomes that are structurally distinct from those of healthy individuals; however, without the ability to track individuals during disease progression, it  has not been possible to observe changes in the microbiome over the course of tumorigenesis. mouse models have demonstrated that these changes can further promote colonic tumorigenesis. however, these models have relied upon mouse-adapted bacterial populations and so it remains unclear which human-adapted bacterial populations are responsible for modulating tumorigenesis. results: we transplanted fecal microbiota from three crc patients and three healthy individuals into germ-free mice, resulting in six structurally distinct microbial communities. subjecting these mice to a chemically induced model of crc resulted  in different levels of tumorigenesis between mice. differences in the number of tumors were strongly associated with the baseline microbiome structure in mice, but not with the cancer status of the human donors. partitioning of baseline communities into enterotypes by dirichlet multinomial mixture modeling resulted in three enterotypes that corresponded with tumor burden. the taxa most strongly  positively correlated with increased tumor burden were members of the bacteroides, parabacteroides, alistipes, and akkermansia, all of which are gram-negative. members of the gram-positive clostridiales, including multiple members of clostridium group xiva, were strongly negatively correlated with tumors. analysis of the inferred metagenome of each community revealed a negative correlation between tumor count and the potential for butyrate production, and a  positive correlation between tumor count and the capacity for host glycan degradation. despite harboring distinct gut communities, all mice underwent conserved structural changes over the course of the model. the extent of these changes was also correlated with tumor incidence. conclusion: our results suggest that the initial structure of the microbiome determines susceptibility to colonic tumorigenesis. there appear to be opposing roles for certain gram-negative (bacteroidales and verrucomicrobia) and gram-positive (clostridiales) bacteria in tumor susceptibility. thus, the impact of community structure is potentially mediated by the balance between protective, butyrate-producing populations and inflammatory, mucin-degrading populations.

TI  == butyrate-producing bacteria, including mucin degraders, from the swine intestinal tract.
AB  == to identify bacteria with potential for influencing gut health, 980 anaerobes were cultured from the swine intestinal tract and analyzed for butyrate production. fifteen isolates in the order clostridiales produced butyrate and had butyryl coenzyme a (coa):acetate coa transferase activity. three of the isolates  grew on mucin, suggesting an intimate association with host intestinal mucosa.

TI  == dietary resistant and butyrylated starches have different effects on the faecal bacterial flora of azoxymethane-treated rats.
AB  == epidemiological studies have suggested that dietary fibre lowers the risk of colorectal cancer, which may be due to increased butyrate production from colonic fermentation of a type of fibre, resistant starch (rs). the present study investigated the effects of dietary rs and butyrylated rs on the faecal microbiota of rats treated with azoxymethane. a total of four groups of nine rats were fed diets containing either standard maize starch (low-amylose maize starch  (lams), low rs), lams with 3 % tributyrin (lamst), cooked 10 % high-amylose maize starch (hams, high rs) or cooked 10 % butyrylated hams (hamsb). faecal samples were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of pcr-amplified  16s rrna gene fragments. multivariate analysis demonstrated no differences between faecal microbiota before treatment but revealed differences in dgge patterns between diet groups, with the exception of the two low-rs groups (lams and lamst). subsequent analysis identified eleven dgge bands contributing significantly to the differentiation between diets. these phylotypes belonged to  clostridiales (five), lactobacillus (one) and bacteroidetes (five) lineages. rats fed hams had increased concentration of propionate in their distal colonic digesta and developed faecal populations containing ruminococcus bromii-like bacteria. hamsb increased propionate and butyrate concentrations in distal colonic digesta and was associated with the appearance of two non-butyrate-producing bacteria, lactobacillus gasseri and parabacteroides distasonis. in conclusion, supplementation with specific dietary rs leads to changes in faecal microbiota profiles that may be associated with improved bowel  health.

TI  == effect of dietary protein level on growth performance, indicators of enteric health, and gastrointestinal microbial ecology of weaned pigs induced with postweaning colibacillosis.
AB  == the effect of dietary cp level on performance, enteric health, and gastrointestinal microbial ecology of weaned pigs challenged with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) k88 was investigated in a 14-d study. forty weaned pigs (bw = 5.32 +/- 0.24 kg, mean +/- sd), housed 4 per pen, were randomly assigned to 2 diets (5 pens/diet): 1) 22.5% cp or 2) 17.6% cp supplemented with aa. diets contained the same amount of me and standardized ileal digestible lys, met + cys, thr, and trp based on the ideal protein ratio. isoleucine and val were added to the 17.6% cp diet up to the level in the 22.5% cp diet. on d 8 postweaning, pigs  were challenged with 6 ml of etec suspension (10(10) cfu/ml) by gavage. feed disappearance and bw were measured on d 7, 9, 10, 12, and 14 for determination of adg, adfi, and g:f. one pig from each pen was serially slaughtered on -1, 3, and  7 d postchallenge (10 pigs/d of slaughter) to evaluate gut morphology, and gut microbial ecology and metabolites. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had greater (p < 0.05) adg and g:f than those fed the 17.6% cp diet before infection, but performance was similar between the 2 diets after etec challenge and overall. on  d 3 after challenge, etec was not detected in the ileal digesta of pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet but was detected in the ileal digesta of 80% of pigs fed the 22.5%  cp diet (5.22 +/- 1.07 cfu/g, mean +/- sd). pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet had a greater (p < 0.01) prevalence of order clostridiales (73 vs. 50%), family lachnospiraceae (43 vs. 18%), and genus roseburia (13 vs. 3%) in the colon digesta 7 d after challenge compared with those fed the 22.5% cp diet. the richness and diversity of bacteria in the colon digesta were less (p < 0.05) in pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet than in those fed the 22.5% cp diet at -1, 3, and 7 d  postchallenge. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had greater (p < 0.05) ammonia n concentration in the colon digesta on -1 and 7 d after challenge compared with those fed the 17.6% cp diet. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had deeper (p < 0.05) crypts 1 d before challenge, shorter villi 3 d after challenge, and reduced villus height:crypt depth 1 d before and 3 d after challenge compared with those  fed the 17.6% cp diet. in conclusion, a reduction in the dietary cp level of weaned pigs from 22.5 to 17.6% with aa supplementation impaired growth performance before, but not after, the etec challenge and increased the relative  composition of butyrate producing bacteria in the colon digesta after etec challenge.
