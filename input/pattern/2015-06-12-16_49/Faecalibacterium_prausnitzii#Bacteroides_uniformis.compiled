TI  - Senior Thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using PCR-DGGE and real-time PCR.
AB  - The fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy Thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Among the 186 DNA bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium colicanis, Eubacterium eligenes, E. rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Megamonas funiformis, Prevotella copri, and Roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Clostridium, and F. prausnitzii. A dendrogram of the PCR-DGGE divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The fecal microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time PCR focused on Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostrium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale, C. leptum, Lactobacillus, and Prevotella. The nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the Bacteroides and Prevotella genera, respectively. No significant differences were found in the counts of Bifidabacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, C. coccoides-E. rectale group, C. leptum group, and Lactobacillus. Therefore, these findings on the microbiota of healthy Thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of South East Asians with similar diets.
TI  - Disrupted intestinal microbiota and intestinal inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis and its restoration with Lactobacillus GG: a randomised clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal inflammation is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF). Administration of probiotics can reduce intestinal inflammation and the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations. We investigated the composition of intestinal microbiota in children with CF and analyzed its relationship with intestinal inflammation. We also investigated the microflora structure before and after Lactobacillus GG (LGG) administration in children with CF with and without antibiotic treatment. METHODS: The intestinal microbiota were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Intestinal inflammation was assessed by measuring fecal calprotectin (CLP) and rectal nitric oxide (rNO) production in children with CF as compared with healthy controls. We then carried out a small double-blind randomized clinical trial with LGG. RESULTS: Twenty-two children with CF children were enrolled in the study (median age, 7 years; range, 2-9 years). Fecal CLP and rNO levels were higher in children with CF than in healthy controls (184+/-146 microg/g vs. 52+/-46 microg/g; 18+/-15 vs. 2.6+/-1.2 micromol/L NO2 (-), respectively; P<0.01). Compared with healthy controls, children with CF had significantly different intestinal microbial core structures. The levels of Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were reduced in children with CF. A similar but more extreme pattern was observed in children with CF who were taking antibiotics. LGG administration reduced fecal CLP and partially restored intestinal microbiota. There was a significant correlation between reduced microbial richness and intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: CF causes qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota, which may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of CF. Administration of probiotics restored gut microbiota, supporting the efficacy of probiotics in reducing intestinal inflammation and pulmonary exacerbations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 01961661.
TI  - Future for probiotic science in functional food and dietary supplement development.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this study is to provide an update of probiotic science evolving from classical approaches to the development of next-generation probiotics, parallel to advances in the understanding of the complexity of the gut microbiome and its role in human health. RECENT FINDINGS: The probiotic concept is based on the notion that the gut ecosystem contributes to human physiology and, consequently, its modulation may help to maintain health and reduce disease risk. The understanding of the complexity of the gut microbiota and the specific components associated with progression from health to disease is rapidly increasing, thanks to the use of high-throughput and next-generation sequencing techniques in progressively better controlled epidemiological studies. Evidence on microbiome-mediated effects by intervention with classical probiotics on humans is, however, limited. The new information is helping to set a rationale for selection of a next generation of probiotics. Candidates include Clostridia clusters IV, XIVa and XVIII, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides uniformis, the effects of which have been evaluated in preclinical trials with promising results for inflammatory and diet-related disorders. Yet, the extent to which new probiotic formulations consisting of nonconventional indigenous gut bacteria will be effective on humans at a population level or in personalized nutrition strategies remains to be explored. SUMMARY: Understanding the role that indigenous intestinal bacteria and their ecological interactions play in human health and disease based on epidemiological, intervention and mechanistic studies will provide a robust rationale for selection of probiotic strains and facilitate the optimization of integrated dietary strategies to efficiently modulate the human gut microbiome, leading to improvements in nutrition and clinical practice.
TI  - Mucosa-associated bacteria in two middle-aged women diagnosed with collagenous colitis.
AB  - AIM: To characterize the colon microbiota in two women histologically diagnosed with collagenous colitis using a culture-independent method. METHODS: Biopsies were taken from the ascending colon and the total DNA was extracted. Universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The amplicons were then cloned into competent Escherichia coli cells. The clones were sequenced and identified by comparison to known sequences. RESULTS: The clones could be divided into 44 different phylotypes. The microbiota was dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Seven phylotypes were found in both patients and constituted 47.5% of the total number of clones. Of these, the most dominating were clones similar to Bacteroides cellulosilyticus, Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides dorei within Bacteroidetes. Sequences similar to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium citroniae were also found in both patients. CONCLUSION: A predominance of potentially pathogenic Bacteroides spp., and the presence of clones showing similarity to Clostridium clostridioforme were found but the overall colon microbiota showed similarities to a healthy one. Etiologies for collagenous colitis other than an adverse bacterial flora must also be considered.
TI  - Bacteroides uniformis is a putative bacterial species associated with the degradation of the isoflavone genistein in human feces.
AB  - Inter-individual variation in isoflavone absorption depends on gut microbial degradation and affects the efficacy of these compounds. We hypothesized that inter-individual variation in fecal isoflavone disappearance coincided with variation in bacterial species. In vitro anaerobic fecal disappearance of isoflavones was measured from 33 participants by HPLC. Fecal microbial 16S rRNA variable region PCR products were obtained from 4 participants with the greatest and least genistein or glycitein degradation and were subjected to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. DNA bands with a homology of 90-95% to Bacteroides uniformis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were present in greater intensities in fecal samples showing a genistein disappearance rate constant of 1.47 +/- 0.14 h(-1) compared with those with a genistein disappearance rate constant of 0.15 +/- 0.03 h(-1) (P < 0.05). Human fecal bacterial species with DNA sequences 90-100% homologous to Tannerella forsythensis and 4 other species were present in greater intensities in fecal samples showing a glycitein disappearance rate constant of 0.57 +/- 0.30 h(-1) compared with fecal samples with a glycitein disappearance rate constant of 0.08 +/- 0.03 h(-1) (P < 0.05). In high degraders, B. uniformis may be a candidate for genistein degradation and T. forsythensis for glycitein degradation, based on fecal isoflavone degradation in the presence of these species. Bacteroides acidifaciens increased isoflavone disappearance in anaerobic human fecal incubations under nutrient-rich and -depleted conditions, suggesting this species as one responsible for the generally high degradation of isoflavones by humans. These fecal microbes are candidate biomarkers for interindividual variation in isoflavone uptake and efficacy.
