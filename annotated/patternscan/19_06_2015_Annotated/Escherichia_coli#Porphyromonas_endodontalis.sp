TI  == assessing the oral microbiota of healthy and alcohol-treated rats using whole-genome dna probes from human bacteria.
AB  == objective: this study aimed to evaluate the capacity of whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria to cross-react with bacteria from the oral cavity of rats, and to assess the influence of alcohol ingestion on the animals'  oral biofilm. design: twenty four mature wistar rats were equally divided in two  groups. one group (control) was fed balanced diet of rat pellets and water. the alcohol-treated group (at) received the same diet and 20% ethanol solution. upon  euthanasia after 30 days, bacterial samples from the oral biofilm covering the animals' teeth were collected using microbrushes. bacteria identification and quantification were performed using the dna checkerboard hybridization method with 33 probes prepared from human oral bacteria. signals corresponding to bacterial genome counts and percentages were compared using a mann-whitney u test with a significance level <0.05. results: cross-reaction for all targeted species, except streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis-like species, occurred in the control group. escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas endodontalis, and veillonella parvula-like species only produced detectable signals in the at group. significantly more signals were detected in the control group compared to the at group (p=0.001). the percentage of e. coli-like species was highest in both groups. conclusions: whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria can cross-react with rats' oral bacterial species. alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels and diversity of bacterial species in the oral cavity of rats.

TI  == porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharides induce rankl by mouse osteoblast in a way different from that of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == introduction: porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) has been shown  to have a high positive rate in infected root canals and symptomatic apical periodontitis. it may play an integral role as a potent stimulator of inflammatory cytokines involved in apical lesions. the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappab ligand (rankl) has been proven to be the key regulator of bone remodeling. this study investigated p. endodontalis lps-induced rankl production and lps signaling in mouse osteoblasts. methods: lps-induced rankl production in mouse osteoblast mc3t3-e1 cells was measured by western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the toll-like receptors (tlrs) were determined by the blocking test using anti-tlrs antibodies. in addition, specific inhibitors were used to analyze the intracellular signaling pathways. escherichia coli lps was used as the control. results: both of the anti-tlr2 and anti-tlr4 antibodies significantly (p < .05) inhibited the expression of rankl from osteoblasts stimulated with p. endodontalis lps; only anti-tlr2 antibody had a significant (p < .05) inhibitory effect on e. coli lps signaling. sp600125 (c-jun n-terminal kinase [jnk] inhibitor) prevented the up-regulation of rankl expression in p. endodontalis lps-infected osteoblasts (p < .05). the inhibitory  effect of wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) and pd98059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase [mapk]/extracellular signal-regulated kinase [erk] kinase-1/2 [mek 1/2] inhibitor) were observed in e. coli lps-treated mouse  osteoblasts (p < .05). conclusions: results from this study showed that p. endodontalis lps has the ability to promote the expression of rankl in mouse osteoblasts, and this induction was mainly through the tlr2/4-jnk signaling pathway, a situation quite different from that of typical bacterial endotoxin (e. coli lps).

TI  == mapk signaling is required for lps-induced vegf in pulp stem cells.
AB  == caries-induced pulpitis is typically accompanied by an increase in dental pulp microvascular density. however, the mechanisms by which dental pulp cells recognize lipopolysaccharides (lpss) remain unclear. we hypothesized that porphyromonas endodontalis and escherichia coli lpss induce vascular endothelial  growth factor (vegf) expression in dental pulp stem cells (dpsc) and human dental pulp fibroblasts (hdpf) through mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signaling. elisa, semi-quantitative rt-pcr, immunofluorescence, and western blots were used. here, we observed that lpss induced vegf expression in dpsc and hdpf cells, and both cell types express toll-like receptor 4 (tlr- 4). notably, lps-induced vegf is associated with phosphorylation of protein kinase c (pkc zeta) and extracellular signal-regulator kinase (erk1/2) and is dependent upon mapk activation. analysis of these data, collectively, unveils a signaling pathway responsible for synthesis of vegf by pulp cells and suggests a novel therapeutic target for the management of vascular responses in teeth with pulpitis.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  == since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (pmc) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola and prevotella melaninogenica. the mic of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the mic of pmc from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. the highest mic value of pmc was detected for e. faecalis whereas e. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. the highest mic values of chlorhexidine  were observed for p. aeruginosa whereas e. coli and p. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. since the mic values observed are much  lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.

TI  == production of macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-1alpha and mip-1beta by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils stimulated with porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == this study was undertaken to investigate the capacity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) to secrete macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-1alpha and mip-1beta after stimulation with porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide (lps). escherichia coli lps was used as a positive control. venous blood was collected and pmns were isolated from healthy volunteers. cells were cultured with various concentrations of lps for different periods of time. cell supernatants were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the levels of chemokine secretion in pmns stimulated with each lps were found to be significantly higher than in the unstimulated control cells (p < 0.05), and this  expression occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner. e. coli lps induced higher levels of cytokines than p. endodontalis lps. these findings demonstrated  that p. endodontalis lps is capable of stimulating pmns to produce chemotactic cytokines and suggested that pmns stimulated with p. endodontalis lps may play a  crucial role in the inflammatory and immunopathological reactions of pulpal and periapical diseases.

TI  == invasion of vascular cells in vitro by porphyromonas endodontalis.
AB  == aim: the objective of this study was to determine whether laboratory strains and  clinical isolates of microorganisms associated with root canal infections can invade primary cultures of cardiovascular cells. methodology: quantitative levels of bacterial invasion of human coronary artery endothelial cells (hcaec) and coronary artery smooth muscle cells (casmc) were measured using a standard antibiotic protection assay. transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm and visualize internalization within the vascular cells. results: of the laboratory and clinical strains tested, only p. endodontalis atcc 35406 was invasive in an antibiotic protection assay using hcaec and casmc. invasion of p.  endodontalis atcc 35406 was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. discussion: certain microorganisms associated with endodontic infections are invasive. if bacterial invasion of the vasculature contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, then microorganisms in the pulp chamber represent potential pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic  pathogens. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of  four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (ah26, ah plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (n2), and one calcium hydroxide-based  sealer (sealapex). the testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. all the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial  activity. the sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types  and bacterial strains. n2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. the extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.

TI  == inflammatory cytokine production and specific antibody responses to lipopolysaccharide from endodontopathic black-pigmented bacteria in patients with multilesional periapical periodontitis.
AB  == we examined the induction of the cytokines interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6, and il-8 by lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from several species of possible endodontopathic black-pigmented bacteria. studies were conducted in human whole blood cultures from six patients (two from each group) with differing numbers of  periapical periodontitis lesions (i.e. patients with radiographically clear periapical lesions in 10 or more teeth (high-lesion group, n = 4), in one or two  teeth (low-lesion group, n = 6), and six healthy volunteers with no periapical lesions (no lesion group)). lps from prevotella intermedia atcc 25611, porphyromonas gingivalis 381, and prophyromonas endodontalis atcc 27067 induced a higher il-8 response in the subjects of the high-lesion group, compared with the  subjects of the other two groups. to ascertain the degree of sensitization by test bacteria, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in serum and saliva from the subjects to different bacterial species. lps from p. gingivalis reacted  strongly with sera from the high-lesion group. thus, lps from black-pigmented bacteria may be involved in multilesional periapical periodontitis by inducing particular cytokines and/or humoral immune responses.

TI  == experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  == a small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (gf) and conventional (cv) mice. the selected microorganisms were: porphyromonas endodontalis (atcc 35406), eubacterium lentum  (atcc 25559), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc 27337), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 4083). only p. anaerobius, e. coli, and e. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both cv and gf mice. e. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in cv animals. p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were unable to colonize in cv and gf animals after single inoculation. it is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein  is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a nonpigmented variant of porphyromonas endodontalis.
AB  == porphyromonas endodontalis forms dark colonies on media containing blood. we isolated, from an infected root canal, a non-black-pigmented p. endodontalis variant, ksew01, which forms beige colonies on blood agar media. to characterize  this variant, we compared its properties with those of two black-pigmented p. endodontalis strains, atcc35406 and kse105. strain ksew01 had a gelatinase activity comparable to that of the pigmented strains. cell lysates of these three strains resolved by sds-page electrophoresis showed similar protein patterns. quantitative dna-dna hybridization experiments indicated high homology between the nonpigmented strain ksew01 and the two dark-pigmented strains. from these results, we identified strain ksew01 as a p. endodontalis nonpigmented variant. dna restriction endonuclease analysis indicated that the variant was closely related to a pigmented strain, kse105. in contrast to the pigmented strains, strain ksew01 did not degrade hemoglobin and formed no vesicles when cultured in  the presence of blood. the susceptibilities of these three strains to 22 antibiotics were similar except for vancomycin. the nonpigmented variant was the  most resistant to vancomycin (mic: atcc35406, 6.25 micrograms/ml; kse105,12.5 micrograms/ml; ksew01, 100 micrograms/ml). overall, a relationship may exist between the presence of black-pigmentation and outer membrane systems of p. endodontalis.

TI  == effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
AB  == human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (lps). the effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the dna content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. lps samples were purified from porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and escherichia coli 0111:b4 lps was used as a positive control. at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the lpss caused any change in the production of dna or protein, whereas the amount of dna was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. protein synthesis was decreased by lpss at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of lps tested.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of the naha gene from porphyromonas gingivalis indicates that beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase is an outer-membrane-associated lipoprotein.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated in human periodontal diseases. it expresses a number of exoglycosidase enzymes capable of hydrolysing host proteoglycan residues. as a first stage to explore the role of these enzymes in periodontal tissue damage, the naha gene of p. gingivalis w83, which encodes beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase (beta-nahase), was cloned. the gene was expressed poorly in escherichia coli, but increased expression was achieved by cloning the  naha gene downstream of the tac promoter. southern blot analysis revealed that naha was present as a single copy, and it was found in all the other p. gingivalis strains tested. in contrast, sequences homologous to naha were not detected in either p. endodontalis or p. asaccharolytica. the naha gene was 2331  bp long and encoded a beta-nahase enzyme of 777 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 87 kda. a characteristic signal peptide for an acylated lipoprotein was present at the amino-terminus, suggesting that the mature beta-nahase is a lipoprotein. the predicted amino acid sequence of the p. gingivalis beta-nahase shared homology with the catalytic domains of the human beta-nahase enzyme and the chitinase of vibrio harveyi, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism.
