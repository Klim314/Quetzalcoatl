TI  == characterization of the gut microbiota of papua new guineans using reverse transcription quantitative pcr.
AB  == there has been considerable interest in composition of gut microbiota in recent years, leading to a better understanding of the role the gut microbiota plays in  health and disease. most studies have been limited in their geographical and socioeconomic diversity to high-income settings, and have been conducted using small sample sizes. to date, few analyses have been conducted in low-income settings, where a better understanding of the gut microbiome could lead to the greatest return in terms of health benefits. here, we have used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting dominant and sub-dominant groups of microorganisms associated with human gut microbiome in 115 people living a subsistence lifestyle in rural areas of papua new guinea. quantification of clostridium coccoides group, c. leptum subgroup, c. perfringens, bacteroides fragilis group, bifidobacterium, atopobium cluster, prevotella, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, staphylococcus, and lactobacillus spp. was conducted. principle coordinates analysis (pcoa) revealed two dimensions with prevotella, clostridia, atopobium, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus and staphylococcus grouping in one dimension, while b. fragilis, bifidobacterium and  lactobacillus grouping in the second dimension. highland people had higher numbers of most groups of bacteria detected, and this is likely a key factor for  the differences revealed by pcoa between highland and lowland study participants. age and sex were not major determinants in microbial population composition. the  study demonstrates a gut microbial composition with some similarities to those observed in other low-income settings where traditional diets are consumed, which have previously been suggested to favor energy extraction from a carbohydrate rich diet.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria grow within candida albicans biofilms and induce biofilm formation in suspension cultures.
AB  == the human microbiome contains diverse microorganisms, which share and compete for the same environmental niches. a major microbial growth form in the human body is the biofilm state, where tightly packed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells must cooperate and/or compete for resources in order to survive. we examined mixed biofilms composed of the major fungal species of the gut microbiome, candida albicans, and each of five prevalent bacterial gastrointestinal inhabitants: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. we observed that biofilms formed by c. albicans provide a hypoxic microenvironment that supports the growth of two anaerobic bacteria, even when cultured in ambient oxic conditions that are normally toxic to the bacteria. we also found that coculture with bacteria in biofilms induces massive gene expression changes in c. albicans, including upregulation of wor1, which encodes a transcription regulator that controls a phenotypic switch in c. albicans, from the "white" cell type to the "opaque" cell type. finally, we observed that in suspension cultures, c. perfringens induces aggregation of c. albicans into "mini-biofilms," which allow c. perfringens cells to survive in a normally toxic environment. this work indicates that bacteria and c. albicans interactions modulate the local chemistry of their environment in multiple ways to create niches favorable to their growth and survival.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against clinical anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == this study evaluated the in vitro anti-anaerobic activity and spectrum of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against 375 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria, including gram-negative bacilli (181 strains), gram-negative  cocci (11 strains), gram-positive bacilli (139 strains) and gram-positive cocci (44 strains), covering 34 species. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levornidazole, its five metabolites and three comparators against these anaerobic isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of levornidazole and metronidazole were measured against 22 strains of bacteroides fragilis. levornidazole showed good activity against b. fragilis, other bacteroides spp., clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens  and peptostreptococcus magnus, evidenced by mic90 values of 0.5, 1, 0.25, 2 and 1mg/l, respectively. the activity of levornidazole and the comparators was poor for veillonella spp. generally, levornidazole displayed activity similar to or slightly higher than that of metronidazole, ornidazole and dextrornidazole against anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive bacilli and gram-positive  cocci, especially b. fragilis. favourable anti-anaerobic activity was also seen with levornidazole metabolites m1 and m4 but not m2, m3 or m5. for the 22 clinical b. fragilis strains, mbc50 and mbc90 values of levornidazole were 2mg/l  and 4mg/l, respectively. both mbc50/mic50 and mbc90/mic90 ratios of levornidazole were 4, similar to those of metronidazole. levornidazole is an important anti-anaerobic option in clinical settings in terms of its potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity, bactericidal property, and the anti-anaerobic activity of its metabolites m1 and m4.

TI  == cytotoxicity comparison of quercetin and its metabolites from in vitro fermentation of several gut bacteria.
AB  == part of quercetin is coerced into the colon after ingestion and interacts with the gut microbiota. the interaction between quercetin and gut microbiota will influence human health. the cytotoxicity of quercetin and its metabolites from human gut bacteria in vitro fermentation was investigated in this study. the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide) (mtt) and agar diffusion disc methods were individually applied in vitro to examine their inhibitory effect on three cultured human cancer cells and five pathogenic bacteria species. the results showed that the metabolites from clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis exerted a strong inhibitory effect (p < 0.05) on hct-116 cells and that of weissella confusa was stronger (p < 0.01) on both a549 cells and hela cells than on the others. most metabolites have similar  or decreased inhibitory ability on human cancer cells compared to quercetin itself. this inhibitory effect had not been detected in quercetin and its metabolites in five common pathogenic bacteria species. quercetin is a potential  chemopreventive agent. however, this study reported that some gut bacteria can improve their function of inhibiting cancer cells after fermenting quercetin.

TI  == trends in the susceptibility of commonly encountered clinically significant anaerobes and susceptibilities of blood isolates of anaerobes to 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, 2008-2012, northern taiwan.
AB  == we investigated the antimicrobial resistance trends and profiles of clinical anaerobic isolates in northern taiwan. trends in the susceptibility of five commonly encountered clinical anaerobic isolates to seven agents from 2008 to 2012 were measured using the cochran-armitage trend test. the minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mics) of 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, against anaerobic blood isolates from two medical centers were determined using the agar dilution method. during the study period, susceptibility data on 11,105 isolates were evaluated. metronidazole and chloramphenicol retained excellent activities. around 20-30 % of isolates of bacteroides and prevotella species were resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam, cefmetazole, flomoxef, and clindamycin. of the 507 tested blood isolates, the rates of resistance to commonly used agents were much higher, namely, 16.2 % for  amoxicillin-clavulanate, 15.6 % for ampicillin-sulbactam, 24.7 % for cefmetazole, and 36.1 % for clindamycin. notably, 13.5 % of b. fragilis isolates were resistant to ertapenem. also, 15.2 % of b. uniformis, 17.2 % of other bacteroides species, 14.3 % of prevotella species, and 14 % of clostridium other than c. perfringens isolates were resistant to moxifloxacin. cefoperazone-sulbactam was active against most isolates, except for clostridium species other than perfringens (resistance rate, 18.6 %). fidaxomicin exerted poor activities against most anaerobes tested (mic90 of >128 mug/ml for b. fragilis and all isolates), except for c. perfringens (mic90 of 0.03 mug/ml) and peptostreptococcus micros (mic90 of 2 mug/ml). however, rifaximin showed a wide range of susceptibilities against the tested anaerobes (mic90 of 0.5 mug/ml for b. fragilis). the emergence of resistance to ertapenem and moxifloxacin among bacteremic anaerobes highlights the need for continuous monitoring.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria in ontario, 2010-2011.
AB  == the local epidemiology of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in anaerobic bacteria is important in guiding the empiric treatment of infections. however, susceptibility data are very limited on anaerobic organisms, particularly among non-bacteroides organisms. to determine susceptibility profiles of clinically-significant anaerobic bacteria in ontario canada, anaerobic isolates from sterile sites submitted to public health ontario laboratory (phol) for identification and susceptibility testing were included in this study. using the  e-test method, isolates were tested for various antimicrobials including, penicillin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole. the mic results were interpreted based on guidelines published by  clinical and laboratory standards institute. of 2527 anaerobic isolates submitted to phol, 1412 were either from sterile sites or bronchial lavage, and underwent susceptibility testing. among bacteroides fragilis, 98.2%, 24.7%, 1.6%, and 1.2%  were resistant to penicillin, clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole, respectively. clostridium perfringens was universally susceptible  to penicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and meropenem, whereas 14.2% of other clostridium spp. were resistant to penicillin. among gram-positive anaerobes, actinomyces spp., parvimonas micra and propionibacterium spp. were universally susceptible to beta-lactams. eggerthella spp., collinsella spp., and eubacterium  spp. showed variable resistance to penicillin. among gram-negative anaerobes, fusobacterium spp., prevotella spp., and veillonella spp. showed high resistance  to penicillin but were universally susceptible to meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. the detection of metronidazole resistant b. fragilis is  concerning as occurrence of these isolates is extremely rare. these data highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance to provide clinically relevant information to clinicians for empiric management of infections caused by anaerobic organisms.

TI  == production of human metabolites by gastrointestinal bacteria as a potential source of post-mortem alteration of antemortem drug/metabolite concentrations.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that bacterial species are capable of transforming complex chemical substances. several of these species, native to the human gastrointestinal tract, are active in postmortem decomposition. they have potential to cause biotransformations affecting compound-to-metabolite ratios within the human body, especially after death. investigation of postmortem effects could supply valuable information, especially concerning compound identification and confirmation. the purpose of this research was to investigate  the effects of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens on diazepam and flunitrazepam in reinforced clostridial medium, and to compare bacterial biotransformation products to those of human metabolism. a decrease in diazepam concentration between pre- and post-incubation was observed  for samples inoculated with escherichia coli (14.7-20.2%) as well as bacteroides  fragilis (13.9-25.7%); however there was no corresponding increase in concentration for the monitored human metabolites. flunitrazepam demonstrated a greater concentration loss when incubated with individual bacterial species as well as mixed culture (79.2-100.0%). samples incubated with bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and mixed culture resulted in nearly complete conversion of flunitrazepam. increased 7-aminoflunitrazepam concentrations accounted for the majority of the conversion; however discrepancies in the mass balance of the reaction suggested the possibility of a minor metabolite that was not monitored in the current analysis. these experiments served as a pilot study and proof of concept that can be adapted and applied to a realm of possibilities. ultimately,  this methodology would be ideal to study compounds that are too toxic or lethal for animal and human metabolic investigations.

TI  == isolation and identification of quercetin degrading bacteria from human fecal microbes.
AB  == quercetin has a wide range of biological properties. the gut microflora can often modulate its biological activity and their potential health effects. there still  is a lack of information about gut bacteria involving in this process. the strains of gut microbes from human feces that can transform quercetin were isolated and identified by in vitro fermentation. the results showed that escherichia coli, stretococcus lutetiensis, lactobacillus acidophilus, weissella  confusa, enterococcus gilvus, clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis have the various ability of degrading quercetin. among them, c. perfringens and b. fragilis were discovered to have the strongest ability of degrading quercetin. additionally, quercetin can't inhibit the growth of c. perfringens. in conclusion, many species of gut microbiota can degrade quercetin, but their ability are different.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == background: the growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria  were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. method: a microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate  the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the test materials against the organisms. results: delta-3-carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of gram-positive bacteria (clostridium difficile atcc 9689, clostridium paraputrificum atcc 25780, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 11775 and bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), 0.18-0.70 mg/ml) except for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 13311 (mic, 2.94 mg/ml). the mic of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/ml against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against c. difficile (0.70 mg/ml); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/ml) and 4 (5.80 mg/ml) against c. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/ml), 4 (12.0 mg/ml), and 7 (0.70 mg/ml) against c. perfringens); compound 1 against e. coli (7.20 mg/ml) and s. enterica serovar typhimurium (12.0 mg/ml). overall, all of the constituents were  less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (mic, 0.063-0.25 mg/ ml). the lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium clostridium butyricum atcc 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (b. fragilis and e. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. beneficial gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria was not observed. scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. conclusion: a. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam: a novel cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination.
AB  == avibactam (formerly nxl104, ave1330a) is a synthetic non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits the activities of ambler class a and c beta-lactamases and some ambler class d enzymes. this review summarizes the existing data published for ceftazidime-avibactam, including relevant chemistry,  mechanisms of action and resistance, microbiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy and safety data from animal and human trials. although not a beta-lactam, the chemical structure of avibactam closely resembles portions of the cephem bicyclic ring system, and avibactam has been shown to bond covalently to beta-lactamases. very little is known about the potential for avibactam to select for resistance. the addition of avibactam greatly (4-1024-fold minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] reduction) improves the activity of ceftazidime versus most species of enterobacteriaceae depending on the presence or absence of beta-lactamase enzyme(s). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the addition of avibactam also improves the activity of ceftazidime (~fourfold mic reduction). limited data suggest that the addition of avibactam does not improve the activity of ceftazidime versus acinetobacter species or most anaerobic bacteria (exceptions: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp.). the pharmacokinetics of avibactam follow a two-compartment model and do not appear to be altered by the co-administration  of ceftazidime. the maximum plasma drug concentration (c(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) of avibactam increase linearly with doses ranging from 50 mg to 2,000 mg. the mean volume of distribution and half-life of  22 l (~0.3 l/kg) and ~2 hours, respectively, are similar to ceftazidime. like ceftazidime, avibactam is primarily renally excreted, and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. pharmacodynamic data suggest that ceftazidime-avibactam is rapidly bactericidal versus beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli that are not inhibited by ceftazidime alone.clinical trials to date have reported that ceftazidime-avibactam is as effective as standard carbapenem therapy in complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection, including infection caused by cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative isolates. the safety and tolerability of ceftazidime-avibactam has  been reported in three phase i pharmacokinetic studies and two phase ii clinical  studies. ceftazidime-avibactam appears to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with few serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events reported to date.in conclusion, avibactam serves to broaden the spectrum of ceftazidime versus ss-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli. the  exact roles for ceftazidime-avibactam will be defined by efficacy and safety data from further clinical trials. potential future roles for ceftazidime-avibactam include the treatment of suspected or documented infections caused by resistant gram-negative-bacilli producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl), klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpcs) and/or ampc ss-lactamases. in addition, ceftazidime-avibactam may be used in combination (with metronidazole) for suspected polymicrobial infections. finally, the increased activity of ceftazidime-avibactam versus p. aeruginosa may be of clinical benefit in patients with suspected or documented p. aeruginosa infections.

TI  == population-based assessment of the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of anaerobic bloodstream infections.
AB  == background: anaerobes are a relatively uncommon but important cause of bloodstream infection. however, their epidemiology has not been well defined in non-selected populations. we sought to describe the incidence of, risk factors for, and outcomes associated with anaerobic bacteremia. methods: population-based surveillance for bacteremia with anaerobic microorganisms was conducted in the calgary area (population 1.2 million) during the period from 2000 to 2008. results: a total of 904 incident cases were identified, for an overall population incidence of 8.7 per 100,000 per year; 231 (26 %) were nosocomial, 300 (33 %) were healthcare-associated community-onset, and 373 (41 %) were community-acquired. elderly males were at the greatest risk. the most common pathogens identified were: bacteroides fragilis group (3.6 per 100,000), clostridium (non-perfringens) spp. (1.1 per 100,000), peptostreptococcus spp. (0.9 per 100,000), and clostridium perfringens (0.7 per 100,000). non-susceptibility to metronidazole was 2 %, to clindamycin 17 %, and to penicillin 42 %. relative to the general population, risk factors for anaerobic bloodstream infection included: male sex, increasing age, a prior diagnosis of cancer, chronic liver disease, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), and/or hemodialysis-dependent chronic renal failure (hdcrf). the 30-day mortality was 20 %. increasing age, nosocomial acquisition, presence of malignancy, and several other co-morbid illnesses were independently associated with an increased risk of death. conclusion: anaerobic bloodstream infection is responsible for a significant burden of disease in general populations. the data herein establish the extent to which anaerobes contribute to morbidity and subsequent mortality. this information is key in developing preventative, empiric treatment and research priorities.

TI  == treatment of bran containing bread by baking enzymes; effect on the growth of probiotic bacteria on soluble dietary fiber extract in vitro.
AB  == different ways of treating bran by baking enzymes prior to dough making and the baking process were used to increase the amount of water-soluble dietary fiber (df) in wheat bread with added bran. soluble df was extracted from the bread with water and separated from the digestible material with gastrointestinal tract enzymes and by solvent precipitation. the baking enzyme mixtures tested (xylanase and glucanase/cellulase, with and without lipase) increased the amounts of soluble arabinoxylan and protein resistant to digestion. the isolated fiber was used as a growth substrate for 11 probiotic and intestinal bifidobacterium strains, for commensal strains of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli, and  for potential intestinal pathogenic strains of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium perfringens. fermentation analyses indicated that the tested strains had varying capacity to grow in the presence of the extracted  fiber. of the tested probiotic strains b. longum species generally showed the highest ability to utilize the fiber extracts, although the potential pathogens tested also showed an ability to grow on these fiber extracts. in sum, the enzymes used to improve the baking process for high-fiber bread can also be used  to produce in situ soluble fiber material, which in turn can exert prebiotic effects on certain potentially beneficial microbes.

TI  == nosocomial diarrhea: evaluation and treatment of causes other than clostridium difficile.
AB  == diarrhea is common among hospitalized patients but the causes are distinct from those of diarrhea in the community. we review existing data about the epidemiology of nosocomial diarrhea and summarize recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of diarrhea. clinicians should recognize that most cases of nosocomial diarrhea have a noninfectious etiology, including medications, underlying illness, and enteral feeding. apart from clostridium difficile, the frequency of infectious causes such as norovirus and toxigenic strains of clostridium perfringens, klebsiella oxytoca, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis remains largely undefined and test availability is limited. here we provide a practical approach to the evaluation and management of nosocomial diarrhea when tests for c. difficile are negative.

TI  == oxygen tolerance in anaerobic pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a prerequisite for successful identification of anaerobic pathogenic bacteria from samples of clinical material is the method of cultivation. currently, several methods of cultivation in anaerobic environment are used: cultivation in  anaerobic box, anaerobic jar, and in nonrecurring cultivation system. here, we determined the suitability of the above methods of cultivation using the estimation of the growth (diameters of colony size) of commonly isolated anaerobic pathogens (bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens). the tested bacterial strains were exposed to atmospheric oxygen for various time periods and then they were cultivated using different anaerobic cultivation systems. maximum growth differed, depending on the type of cultivation and the strain used. thus, largest zone diameters, in the majority of measurements, were achieved in the anaerobic box. however, nonrecurring cultivation system seemed better in several cases; this applied to the cultivation of c. perfringens after 15, 30, and 60 min exposure to atmospheric oxygen as well as the cultivation of b. fragilis after 30 and 60 min of oxygen exposure. the cultivation in anaerobic box was the most convenient method for growth of c. difficile. in almost all cases, higher growth was observed in nonrecurring cultivation system than in the system of anaerobic jar. on the other hand, no significant differences were observed among these anaerobic cultivation  systems which confirmed their applicability (taking into account some individual  features concerning the optimization of cultivations) for identification of pathogenic anaerobes.

AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

TI  == effect of apple intake on fecal microbiota and metabolites in humans.
AB  == the effects of apple intake on the fecal flora, water content, ph, and metabolic  activities in eight healthy volunteers and the utilization of apple pectin in vitro were investigated. although several isolates of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, enterococcus, and the bacteroides fragilis group utilized apple pectin, most isolates of escherichia coli, collinsela aerofaciense, eubacterium limosum, and clostridium perfringens could not. when fecal samples from healthy adults were incubated in liquid broth with apple pectin present or absent, the numbers of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in the former were higher than those in the later. after the intake of apples (2 apples a day for 2 weeks) by eight healthy adult humans, the number of bifidobacteria in feces increased (p < 0.05 on day 7 and p < 0.01 on day 14 of the intake period), and the numbers of lactobacillus and streptococcus including enterococcus tended to increase. however, lecithinase-positive clostridia, including c. perfringens, decreased (p  < 0.05), and enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas tended to decrease. moreover, the concentrations of fecal acetic acid tended to increase on apple intake. the fecal ammonia concentration showed a tendency to reduce and fecal sulfide decreased (p  < 0.05) on apple intake. these findings indicate that apple consumption is related to an improved intestinal environment, and apple pectin is one of the effective apple components improving the fecal environment.

TI  == preliminary report on anaerobic culture at mymensingh medical college hospital in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal sepsis is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in developing countries. this study was undertaken to isolate and identify the anaerobic bacterial agents of puerperal sepsis among the patients admitted in mymensingh medical college hospital (mmch) during the period from july 2006 to june 2007. endocervical swabs/secretions were collected from 50 cases of puerperal sepsis and were cultured anaerobically. anaerobiasis was done by using  gas pack (bd gas pak tm ez) in anaerobic jar. out of 50 samples, 42(84%) yielded  growth in cultures. among 42 culture positive cases, 20(40%) were aerobic organisms and 22(44%) were mixed, i.e., aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the isolated anaerobic organisms were peptostreptococcus 14(63.63%), bacteroides fragilis 3(13.64%), prevotella melaninogenica 3(13.64%) and clostridium perfringens 2(9.09%). as a preliminary study, it was observed that anaerobic culture could be carried out with available logistic arrangement. so, it was recommended to design further study on anaerobic bacterial isolation with particular emphasis on their antimicrobial susceptibility.

TI  == bsac standardized disc susceptibility testing method (version 8).
AB  == there have been considerable changes to the format of the recommendations since the previous version (version 7). the majority of the footnotes to the tables have been removed and the notations added to the end column; it is hoped that this change will avoid confusion in interpretation. antibiotics have been separated into groups, e.g. beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, etc. recommendations for urinary tract infections (utis) have been removed for most agents except for  those that are administered solely for the treatment of uncomplicated utis or where there are limited recommendations for specific organisms, e.g. trimethoprim. for agents that previously had dual recommendations, systemic recommendations remain and the intermediate category can be used for interpretation for utis because intermediate susceptibility infers that the infection may respond as the agent is concentrated at the site of infection. this change will also avoid errors in interpretation when an organism is isolated from multiple sites, e.g. blood and urine. the changes that have been made to version  7 are as follows: mic and zone diameter breakpoints (bps) for trimethoprim, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin for utis (table 7); mic and zone diameter breakpoints (bps) for doripenem (tables 7-9); colistin mic bps for pseudomonas spp. (table 9), co-trimoxazole mic bps for stenotrophomonas maltophilia (table 10); staphylococci mic and zone diameter bps for clarithromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, trimethoprim uti, nitrofurantoin uti and rifampicin (table 11); streptococcus pneumoniae mic and zone diameter bps for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, linezolid, rifampicin and telithromycin (table 12); addition of streptomycin recommendations for enterococci (table 13); enterococcal mic and zone diameter bps for quinupristin/dalfopristin, nitrofurantoin uti and trimethoprim uti (table 13); beta-haemolytic streptococci mic and zone diameter bps for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and telithromycin (table 15); clarithromycin and erythromycin mic and zone diameter bps for moraxella catarrhalis (table 16); azithromycin mic bps for neisseria gonorrhoeae (table 17); chloramphenicol and rifampicin mic bps for neisseria meningitidis (table 18); azithromycin mic bps for haemophilus influenzae (table 19); mic bps for metronidazole for bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and clostridium perfringens (tables 23-25, respectively); susceptibility testing of listeria spp. (appendix 3); the acceptable range for atcc 25923 to a 10 microg tobramycin disc (table 26).

TI  == establishment of an analytical system for the human fecal microbiota, based on reverse transcription-quantitative pcr targeting of multicopy rrna molecules.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) was established for the precise evaluation of human intestinal microbiota. group- and species-specific primer sets for clostridium perfringens,  lactobacillus spp. (six subgroups and three species), enterococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. targeting 16s rrna gene sequences were newly developed for the quantitative analysis of such subdominant populations in human intestines. they were used together with previously reported group-specific primer sets for enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp., and six predominant bacterial groups (the clostridium coccoides group, the clostridium leptum subgroup, the bacteroides fragilis group, bifidobacterium spp., the atopobium cluster, and prevotella spp.) for the examination of fecal samples from 40 healthy adults by rt-qpcr with lower detection limits of 10(2) to 10(4) cells per g of feces. the rt-qpcr method gave  data equivalent to those yielded by qpcr for predominant populations of more than 10(8) cells per g of feces and could quantify bacterial populations that were not detectable (staphylococcus and pseudomonas) or those only detected at lower incidences (prevotella, c. perfringens, lactobacillus, and enterococcus) by qpcr  or the culture method. the rt-qpcr analysis of lactobacillus spp. at the subgroup level revealed that a subject has a mean of 4.6 subgroups, with an average count  of log(10)(6.3 +/- 1.5) cells per g of feces. these results suggest that rt-qpcr  is effective for the accurate enumeration of human intestinal microbiota, especially the entire analysis of both predominant and subdominant populations.

TI  == enumeration of some cultivable bacterial groups and characterization of some abiotic variables in the jejunoileal content of prim'holstein veal calves.
AB  == a study was conducted to characterize the bacterial and biochemical composition of the jejunoileal content of veal calves and the effect of pre-slaughter fasting time. at 22 wk of age, 22 preruminant prim'holstein calves fed milk replacer and  pellets (mainly composed of corn) were slaughtered at 6, 12, or 24 h after their  last meal. chyme samples were collected from the jejunoileal compartment just after slaughter, and ph and redox potential were immediately measured. culture-based methods were used to determine the concentrations of total anaerobic microflora, lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, enterococci, and 2 potential pathogenic species, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens. concentrations of l-lactate, ammonia, and short-chain fatty acids (scfa) were determined on frozen samples. the biochemical composition (dm, total protein, lactose, galactose, glucose, minerals, aa profile, and fatty acid profile) of the jejunoileal content was determined only on samples from the 6-h fasted group. microflora concentrations were greater (p < 0.01) in the 6-h fasted group compared with the 12- and 24-h fasted groups, involving a decreased ph (p < 0.05) and greater lactate and scfa concentrations, both linked directly to the fermentative state of the microorganisms. the 6-h fasted group showed the least interanimal variability in  bacterial group levels, except for cl. perfringens, which presented increased interanimal variability regardless of fasting time. at 6 h postprandial, the jejunoileal content of veal calves seemed to be in a stable state, allowing the creation of a database on its biochemical composition. this study is a key first  step in the development of an in vitro system for modeling the jejunoileal ecosystem of veal calves. this model will provide a useful tool for assessing the effects of feed additives on intestinal microflora.

TI  == coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  == coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. the aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and  ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. while 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less  common (4% incidence). coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from bacteroides fragilis with clostridium perfringens, and bifidobacterium adolescentis with c. perfringens. oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from b. adolescentis with fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii with c. perfringens and f. nucleatum with lactobacillus paracasei. heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.

TI  == soluble cd14 and cd83 from human neonatal antigen-presenting cells are inducible  by commensal bacteria and suppress allergen-induced human neonatal th2 differentiation.
AB  == cd14 is expressed on the cell surface of various antigen-presenting cells, and cd83 is a maturation marker for dendritic cells (dc). cd14 and cd83 are also present as soluble proteins, and both have immunoregulatory functions. we examined whether neonatal cord blood monocytes or dc released soluble cd14 (scd14) or scd83 when exposed to the commensal intestinal bacteria clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis. we found that the gram-positive bacteria c. perfringens and s. aureus, but not gram-negative bacteria, induced the release of scd14 from  monocytes. dc, on the other hand, released scd14 in response to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. moreover, the expression of the virulence factor staphylococcal protein a seemed to be important for s. aureus-induced scd14 production from both monocytes and dc. soluble cd83 was released from dc, but not from monocytes, when exposed to both gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria. finally, to investigate whether scd14 or scd83 could modulate neonatal allergen-induced t-cell differentiation, dc were exposed to birch allergen alone or in the presence of scd14 or scd83 and then cocultured with autologous t cells. we demonstrate that scd14 and scd83 inhibited the birch  allergen-induced th2 differentiation by suppressing interleukin 13 production. together, these results suggest that the commensal intestinal flora may be an important stimulus for the developing immune system by inducing the immunoregulatory proteins scd14 and scd83, which may be involved in preventing t-cell sensitization to allergens in infants.

TI  == in vitro activity against anaerobes of retapamulin, a new topical antibiotic for  treatment of skin infections.
AB  == objectives: retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated  as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. methods: the in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. mics were determined by the clsi reference agar  dilution method (m11-a6). results: ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the bacteroides fragilis group. despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the b. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/l or less. all the investigated strains of clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/l retapamulin. three strains of c. difficile and one strain of c. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by <or=2 mg/l. conclusions: at <or=2 mg/l, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. the  broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive. pending further clinical investigation, retapamulin may offer an alternative treatment for anaerobic skin infections in this era of increasing resistance.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

AB  == the effect a common fecal organism, bacteroides fragilis, has on the sporulation  of clostridium perfringens, an organism linked to some cases of antibiotic associated diarrhea, was examined. established b. fragilis cultures significantly decreased the number of heat resistant spores formed by c. perfringens atcc 12915 and increased the number of vegetative cells. to determine if short-chain fatty acids (scfa), fermentation products of b. fragilis, inhibited sporulation, the scfa were added to sporulation broth. sporulation decreased in the presence of acetate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, and succinate. vegetative cell number for c. perfringens decreased in the cultures with isobutyrate. propionate did not affect sporulation or vegetative cell number. the data support the hypothesis that the decrease in short-chain fatty acid concentration following antibiotic therapy predisposes patients to diarrheas caused by c. perfringens.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in new zealand: 1999-2003.
AB  == objectives: routine susceptibility testing of all anaerobic organisms is not advocated, but it is useful for laboratories to test periodically for anaerobic organisms and provide local susceptibility data to guide therapy. this study reports the national trend of antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant anaerobes in new zealand. methods: clinical isolates were tested using standardized methods against a range of antibiotics commonly used to treat anaerobic infections. susceptibility was determined using nccls criteria. the change in susceptibility trends between this study and earlier studies was measured by comparing the geometric mean of the mic. results: a total of 364 anaerobes were tested. penicillin had poor activity against bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., eubacterium spp., clostridium tertium and veillonella spp. in general, fusobacterium spp., bacteroides ureolyticus, propionibacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and anaerobic streptococci isolates, with the exception of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, were penicillin susceptible. amoxicillin/clavulanate showed good activity against most anaerobes, but resistance was seen with bacteroides fragilis group and p. anaerobius isolates. cefoxitin was more active than cefotetan, particularly against non-b. fragilis species, eubacterium spp. and p. anaerobius. meropenem and imipenem showed good activity against all anaerobes, with only 2 and 4% of bacteroides spp., respectively, showing resistance. with the exception of propionibacterium acnes isolates, which are predictably resistant, metronidazole was active against all anaerobes tested. there has been little change in susceptibility since 1997. conclusions: metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate remain good empirical choices when anaerobes are expected in our setting. no clinically relevant changes in susceptibility over time were found.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin against anaerobes studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of moxifloxacin against bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) were studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model. initially, a dose-ranging study with area under the concentration-time curve (auc)/mic ratios of 6.7 to 890 was used to investigate the effect of anaerobic conditions on the auc/mic antibacterial effect (abe) relationship with escherichia coli. the auc/mic ratios for 50% and 90% effects, using a log cfu drop at 24 h as the antibacterial effect measure, were 34 and 59, respectively, aerobic and 54 and 96, respectively, anaerobic. these values are not significantly different. dose ranging at auc/mic ratios of 9 to 216 against the anaerobes indicated a differing auc/mic abe pattern, and the auc/mics for 50% and 90% effects were lower: for b. fragilis, they were 10.5 and  25.7, respectively; for c. perfringens, they were 8.6 and 16.2; and for gpac, they were 7.3 and 17.4. the maximum-effect log drops were as follows: for b. fragilis, -3.2 +/- 0.2 logs; for c. perfringens, -3.7 +/- 0.1 logs; and for gpac, -2.5 +/- 0.1 logs. although the anaerobes were not eradicated, there was no emergence of resistance. comparison of the abe of moxifloxacin to that of ertapenem against b. fragilis indicated that moxifloxacin was superior at 24 h and 48 h. in contrast, ertapenem was superior to moxifloxacin against gpac at 24  h and 48 h and against c. perfringens at 48 h. both drugs performed equivalently  against c. perfringens at 24 h. monte carlo simulations using human serum auc data and an auc/mic anaerobe target of 7.5 suggests a >90% target achievement at  mics of <2 mg/liter. this divides the b. fragilis wild-type mic distribution. the pharmacodynamic properties of moxifloxacin against anaerobes are different than those against aerobic species. the clinical implications of these differences need further exploration.

TI  == synergy in polymicrobial infections in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes.
AB  == human diabetics frequently suffer delayed wound healing, increased susceptibility to localized and systemic infections, and limb amputations as a consequence of the disease. lower-limb infections in diabetic patients are most often polymicrobial, involving mixtures of aerobic, facultative anaerobic, and anaerobic bacteria. the purpose of this study is to determine if these organisms  contribute to synergy in polymicrobial infections by using diabetic mice as an in vivo model. the model was the obese diabetic mouse strain bks.cg-m +/+ lepr(db)/j, a model of human type 2 diabetes. young (5- to 6-week-old) prediabetic mice and aged (23- to 24-week-old) diabetic mice were compared. the mice were injected subcutaneously with mixed cultures containing escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens. progression of the infection (usually abscess formation) was monitored by examining mice for bacterial populations and numbers of white blood cells at 1, 8, and 22 days postinfection. synergy in the mixed infections was defined as a statistically significant increase in the number of bacteria at the site of injection when coinfected with a second bacterium, compared to when the bacterium was inoculated alone. e. coli provided strong synergy to b. fragilis but not to c. perfringens.  c. perfringens and b. fragilis provided moderate synergy to each other but only in young mice. b. fragilis was anergistic (antagonistic) to e. coli in coinfections in young mice at 22 days postinfection. when age-matched nondiabetic mice (c57blks/j) were used as controls, the diabetic mice exhibited 5 to 35 times the number of cfu as did the nondiabetic mice, indicating that diabetes was a significant factor in the severity of the polymicrobial infections.

AB  == the purpose of this study is to deal with the problem of anaerobic cultivation of clinical specimens and consider the possibility of using semi-automated blood culture instruments. the bactec lytic, bact/alert fan anaerobic and bact/alert fn anaerobic bottles were inoculated with bacteriodes fragilis, clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and feingoldia magna strains. the times to detection (ttd) for positive bottles were evaluated with reference to the number of inoculated bacteria. inoculation with the same suspension of equal  bacterial strain resulted in shorter ttd values for all the bactec lytic bottles  as compared with the bact/alert fan anaerobic or bact/alert fn anaerobic bottles, respectively. statistically significant differences were recorded (p=0,05) by bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens species. feingoldia magna was submitted to culture in the bactec lytic alone. the anaerobic blood culture bottles are deemed acceptable for application in the culture of anaerobc isolates drawn from other samples except for blood (namely when prompt delivery of the sample to the laboratory is impossible and the sample can suffer damage), however, only a limited range of microorganisms can be taken into account for the detection purposes. the bactec lytic bottles are more appropriately designed for  the detection of anaerobic bacterial species compared to the bact/alert fan anaerobic and bact/alert fn anaerobic bottles. they achieve faster growth parametres and provide more successful readings of anaerobic bacteria culture and detection.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  == ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. ertapenem is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. it has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. mic(90)s for most species of enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/l, significantly lower than those of imipenem. mic(90)s for most bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/l, and mic(90)s were species specific for clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/l for clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/l for clostridium clostridioforme. ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus). ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in gram-negative organisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of smap-29 against the bacteroides fragilis group and clostridia.
AB  == objectives: the cathelicidin-derived peptide smap-29 exerts rapid and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against aerobic bacteria and fungi. in this study, the effects of the peptide against the bacteroides fragilis group, including antibiotic-resistant isolates, clostridium perfringens and clostridium  difficile reference and clinical isolates, were investigated. methods: the microbicidal activity of smap-29 against eight reference and 100 clinical anaerobic strains from a national collection was assessed using a microdilution susceptibility assay, and by determining the killing kinetics on selected strains. the killing mechanism was investigated further by means of a two-colour  fluorescent permeabilization assay, and by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: the bacteroides fragilis group, clostridium reference strains and most clinical isolates were inhibited in vitro by 1-2 microm (3.2-6.4 mg/l) smap-29, and killed by 1.5- to 2-fold higher peptide concentrations. the anaerobic bacterial cells were 90%-100% permeabilized within 2 h of exposure to bactericidal concentrations of the peptide. the sem images of bacteria exposed to smap-29 provide morphological evidence that the envelope is an important target of the bactericidal activity of this peptide. these results are consistent with earlier studies indicating that smap-29 kills aerobic bacteria with a membranolytic mechanism, and suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria share surface features that are targeted by this peptide. conclusions: these studies demonstrate that the spectrum of antibacterial activity of smap-29 includes the b. fragilis group and clostridium species, and encourage further investigations of the therapeutic potential of this peptide.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == regulation of short-chain fatty acid production.
AB  == short-chain fatty acid (scfa) formation by intestinal bacteria is regulated by many different host, environmental, dietary and microbiological factors. in broad terms, however, substrate availability, bacterial species composition of the microbiota and intestinal transit time largely determine the amounts and types of scfa that are produced in healthy individuals. the majority of scfa in the gut are derived from bacterial breakdown of complex carbohydrates, especially in the  proximal bowel, but digestion of proteins and peptides makes an increasing contribution to scfa production as food residues pass through the bowel. bacterial hydrogen metabolism also affects the way in which scfa are made. this outcome can be seen through the effects of inorganic electron acceptors (nitrate, sulfate) on fermentation processes, where they facilitate the formation of more oxidised scfa such as acetate, at the expense of more reduced fatty acids, such as butyrate. chemostat studies using pure cultures of saccharolytic gut micro-organisms demonstrate that c availability and growth rate strongly affect the outcome of fermentation. for example, acetate and formate are the major bifidobacterial fermentation products formed during growth under c limitation, whereas acetate and lactate are produced when carbohydrate is in excess. lactate  is also used as an electron sink in clostridium perfringens and, to a lesser extent, in bacteroides fragilis. in the latter organism acetate and succinate are the major fermentation products when substrate is abundant, whereas succinate is  decarboxylated to produce propionate when c and energy sources are limiting.

AB  == since co(2) is carbonic acid gas, it will decrease the ph if added to water. therefore, a simple test can determine whether co(2) is present in a gas mixture. if the ph of gassed water does not change significantly, then co(2) is not present in the gas.

TI  == comparative analysis of viral pathogens and potential indicators in shellfish.
AB  == shellfish can be responsible of outbreaks of infectious diseases and current health measures do not guarantee the absence of viral pathogens in this product.  here we examine the presence of pathogenic viruses and potential indicators in shellfish in a comparative analysis.sixty shellfish samples collected in three areas with different levels of faecal contamination were analysed for escherichia coli, total coliforms, clostridium perfringens, somatic coliphages, f-specific phages of rna (f-rna), bacteriophages infecting bacteroides fragilis ryc2056, human adenovirus, enterovirus and hepatitis a virus (hav). viruses were eluted in a glycine buffer at ph 10. the overall percentage of viral pathogens detected was 47% for human adenoviruses, 19% for enteroviruses and 24% for hav. since all the  samples positive for enterovirus and hav were also positives for human adenovirus, the latter may be considered useful as a molecular index of viral contamination in shellfish. no significant differences in the bioaccumulation of  bacteria and bacteriophages for oysters or mussels were observed. it was found that the probability of detection of any of the pathogenic virus decreases as the temperature of shellfish growing waters increases. however, the probability of detecting viruses increases when phages of b. fragilis are found. although more data are needed in order to fulfil the need of viral indicators for controlling the presence of human viruses in shellfish, the obtained results indicate that phages infecting b. fragilis ryc2056 could be a suitable group of bacteriophages  to be used as an indicator of the presence of viruses in shellfish.

TI  == growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
AB  == 2-aminobiphenyl (2-abp), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-abp) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-abp), but not benzidine (bz) and biphenyl (bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, b. bifidium atcc 11863, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 35218, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and salmonella typhimurium ta98, ta100, yg1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. bacteroides distasonis atcc 8503, b. fragilis atcc 25285, b. theataiotaomicron atcc 29741, c. paraputrificum  atcc 26780, c. clostridiiforme atcc 25537, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 and enterococcus faecium atcc 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. the ames salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of aroclor 1254-induced  rat s9 mix. it was found that 4-abp was mutagenic to both ta98 and ta100, and bz  was mutagenic to ta98 in the presence of rat s9 mix. 2-aminobiphenyl, 3-abp, and  bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-aminobiphenyl and 3-abp are chemical isomers of 4-abp and are as strong as 4-abp in inhibiting the growth of  intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-abp. evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of dna that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.

TI  == depuration dynamics of viruses in shellfish.
AB  == the consumption of shellfish has been associated with viral infections even in cases where shellfish complied with the current regulation, which is based on bacterial analysis. in this study, depuration rates of potential indicators and human viruses have been analysed in order to study the use of complementary parameters for evaluating the microbiological quality of depurated shellfish. depuration of naturally highly polluted mussels has been evaluated and analyses for escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, somatic coliphages, f-rna phages and bacteriophages infecting bacteroides fragilis ryc2056 and hsp40, human adenovirus, enterovirus have been done. seawater of the depuration tank was disinfected by uv irradiation, ozone and passed through a skimmer and a biological filter. the correct functioning of the depuration tank was monitored by the quantification of total organic carbon (toc), nh4+ and total aerobic bacteria in the seawater. to study the relation between the bacteriophages and the human viruses analysed, a logistic regression model was applied. f-rna phages are significantly related to human adenoviruses and enteroviruses. thus, they can be used as a complementary parameter for evaluating the efficiency of the depuration treatment. somatic coliphages are also significantly associated with enteroviruses. bacteriophages infecting b. fragilis hsp40 were analysed by the double-agar-layer (dal) method, which quantifies infectious viruses, and by nested pcr, which detects the presence of the genome of these phages. the highest sensitivity of the molecular techniques was demonstrated and the results obtained are an indicator of a close relation between positive results by pcr and the presence of infectious viral particles in shellfish. all shellfish samples were negative for human viruses by pcr after 5 days of depuration treatment and the results obtained applying a regression model also showed negative results or nearly for f-rna phages and bacteriophages infecting b. fragilis ryc2056. thus, in this specific depuration treatment, 5 days may be necessary to assess the sanitary quality of shellfish.

TI  == evaluation of n-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == n-acetylchitooligosaccharides ((glcnac)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. a chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using hcl. after purification, the purity of each (glcnac)(1-6) was >86%. the growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (bm) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize glcnac and (glcnac)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium limosum could use (glcnac)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (glcnac)(1-6). glcnac was used more readily than (glcnac)(2-6) by staphylococcus  aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. in bm, streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.

TI  == characterization of clostridium perfringens strains isolated from polish patients with suspected antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  == background: the aim of our research was to investigate the role of enterotoxin- producing anaerobic bacteria other than clostridium difficile in the etiology of  antibiotic-associated diarrhea. this article presents data related to c. perfringens. material/methods: stool samples taken from 158 patients with suspected antibiotic-associated diarrhea were specifically cultured for clostridium difficile, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens. in order to associate the presence of virulence factors in the bacterial isolates thus collected with disease features, all strains were genetically and phenotypically  analyzed for toxin production. all isolated c. perfringens strains were cultured  in ellner sporulation-promoting medium. results: in 21 of the 158 patients (13%)  c. perfringens could be cultivated from the fecal specimen. none of the strains produced enterotoxin, and consequently the cpe gene was not detected by pcr in any of these strains. c. perfringens and c. difficile were cultivated from the same stool samples in 4 cases. interestingly, in one case toxin a-negative/toxin  b positive c. difficile and non-enterotoxigenic c. perfringens were co-cultured.  after application of a heat shock (100 degrees c at 30 min.) only two c. perfringens strains producing thermoresistant spores were detected. pulsed field  gel electrophoresis (pfge) demonstrated genetic heterogenicity among the c. perfringens strains, suggesting that these bacteria were already presented upon hospital admission. conclusions: it seems unlikely that nosocomial transfer has taken place. the relatively low incidence suggests that c. perfringens is not a major primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

TI  == the regulatory effects of whey retentate from bifidobacteria fermented milk on the microbiota of the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (shime).
AB  == aims: to investigate the effects of whey retentate from bifidobacteria fermented  milk. methods and results: the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (shime) was used. the composition of the microbiota and its metabolic activities were analysed. changes in the microbial composition became apparent within 15 days of the treatment in the vessels representing the ileum and the large intestine. the whey retentate favoured the growth of endogenous bifidobacteria and induced a decrease in bacteroides fragilis and in sulphite-reducing clostridia, especially clostridium perfringens. after the administration was stopped, these populations tended to revert to their original  levels, except for the streptococci and the staphylococci populations. the treatment also led to an increase in acetic acid, ch4 and co2 production, suggesting overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria. ammonium, generally considered  as undesirable, declined. conclusions: the whey retentate clearly altered the microbial community in the shime. significance and impact of the study: whey retentate appears to exert a beneficial effect on the in vitro gastrointestinal system; these findings warrant confirmation by in vivo studies.

TI  == removal of bacterial and viral faecal indicator organisms in a waste stabilization pond system in choconta, cundinamarca (colombia).
AB  == a major objective for domestic wastewater treatment using waste stabilization pond systems is the removal of pathogenic microorganisms. traditional evaluation  parameters for faecal contamination are the total and faecal coliforms. however,  epidemiological studies, environmental resistance and the behaviour in the treatment systems, show that viruses are an important disease agent and even more resistant to disinfection than bacteria. therefore, it is important to introduce  viruses as a faecal indicator and to compare them with the traditional bacterial  indicators. a waste stabilization pond system was evaluated in the municipality of choconta, cundinamarca (colombia), for the removal of faecal indicators (such  as escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens) and viruses like f+, somatic and bacteroides fragilis phages. the system includes two facultative ponds in series with a flow of 1555 m3/day. samples were collected at the entrance of the system, in the two ponds and from the final effluent. results show a decrease between 0.3 and 4.7 logarithmic units in the bacterial indicators and between 1 and 4.6 logarithmic units with viral indicators.

AB  == little is known about the relative importance of the four species of lancefield group g beta-hemolytic streptococci in causing bacteremia and the factors that determine the outcome for patients with group g beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia. from 1997 to 2000, 75 group g beta-hemolytic streptococcal strains were isolated from the blood cultures of 66 patients. sequencing of the 16s rrna  genes of the group g beta-hemolytic streptococci showed that all 75 isolates were streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis. the api system (20 strep) and  vitek system (gpi) successfully identified 65 (98.5%) and 62 (93.9%) isolates, respectively, as s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis with >95% confidence, whereas the atb expression system (id32 strep) only successfully identified 49 isolates (74.2%) as s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis with >95% confidence.  the median age of the patients was 76 years (range, 33 to 99 years). fifty-six patients (85%) were over 60 years old. all patients had underlying diseases. no source of the bacteremia was identified (primary bacteremia) in 34 patients (52%), whereas 17 (26%) had cellulitis and 8 (12%) had bed sore or wound infections. fifty-eight patients (88%) had community-acquired group g streptococcal bacteremia. sixty-two patients (94%) had group g streptococcus recovered in one blood culture, whereas 4 patients (6%) had it recovered in multiple blood cultures. fifty-nine patients (89%) had group g streptococcus as the only bacterium recovered in their blood cultures, whereas in 7 patients other bacteria were recovered concomitantly with the group g streptococcus in the blood cultures (staphylococcus aureus in 3, clostridium perfringens in 2, citrobacter freundii in 1, and bacteroides fragilis in 1). overall, 10 patients (15%) died. male sex, diagnosis other than cellulitis, hospital-acquired bacteremia, and multiple positive blood cultures were associated with mortality [p < 0.005 (relative risk [rr] = 7.6), p < 0.05 (rr = 3.7), p < 0.005 (rr = 5.6), and p < 0.05 (rr = 5.6), respectively]. unlike group c beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia, group g beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia is not a zoonotic infection in hong kong.

AB  == objectives: to study trovafloxacin susceptibility among clinical isolates of four anaerobic bacterial species using minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) determinations, e test assays and disk diffusion test results and to calibrate the disk diffusion method for these species using single strain regression analysis (sra). methods: one-hundred and eighty-seven clinical isolates of four anaerobic bacterial species were included. trovafloxacin mic determinations were  performed using the agar dilution technique and mic estimations using the e test. the disk diffusion test was performed according to swedish reference group for antibiotics standardization. nccls limits for susceptibility categories were applied. sra was performed using 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 microg trovafloxacin disk  contents and atcc control strains. the regression lines obtained permitted the calculation of zone equivalents to mic limits as well as an evaluation of various disk potencies. results: trovafloxacin susceptibility (s + i) was noted in 98.9,  100, 100, and 97% of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium perfringens, and peptostreptococcus magnus strains, respectively, as  judged by mic determinations. agar dilution and e test estimations gave the same  results, but e test values were consistently lower than mic values by the reference method. regression lines calculated for the four species using sra showed different equation constants indicating species-related differences. interpretive zone diameter breakpoints were calculated for the four species and used for the interpretation of susceptibility. conclusions: the disk diffusion test was successfully calibrated for trovafloxacin susceptibility testing of four anaerobic species using single strain regression analysis, sra. there was a good  agreement between the results of mic-tests and disk testing. interpretive errors  of type i are prone to occur among bacteroides isolates and might require species-related mic limits. sra calculations permitted the testing of the effect  of different disk potencies on inhibition zones produced at the interpretive mic  limits. criteria for the selection of a minimal disk content showed that 5 microg trovafloxacin is sufficient, but a 10 microg disk will safeguard against residual laboratory variation without producing too large inhibition zones for very susceptible strains.

AB  == numerous bacterial toxins recognize the actin cytoskeleton as a target. the clostridial binary toxins (iota and c2 families) adp-ribosylate the actin monomers causing the dissociation of the actin filaments. the large clostridial toxins from clostridium difficile, clostridium sordellii and clostridium novyi inactivate, by glucosylation, proteins from the rho family that regulate actin polymerization. in contrast, the cytotoxic necrotic factor from escherichia coli  activates rho by deamidation and increases the formation of actin filaments. the  enterotoxin of bacteroides fragilis is a protease specific for e-cadherin and it  promotes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. the bacterial toxins that  modify the actin cytoskeleton induce various cell disfunctions including changes  in cell barrier permeability and disruption of intercellular junctions.

TI  == effects of germinated barley foodstuff on microflora and short chain fatty acid production in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in rats.
AB  == germinated barley foodstuff (gbf) administration has been previously reported to  suppress dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced experimental colitis. in this study, we investigated the roles of the intestinal microflora and short chain fatty acids (scfas) following administration of gbf in dss-induced rat colitis. sprague-dawley rats were fed 3% (w/w of diet) dss in gbf-diets for 5 days. the control rats were fed 3% dss in cellulose-diets for 5 days. the administration of gbf effectively prevented bloody diarrhea and mucosal damage as compared to control rats. gbf significantly elevated fecal acetic acid and n-butyric acid levels. gbf tended to increase the number of eubacteria and that of bifidobacteria as compared to control rats. in addition, the number of enterobacteriaceae, the total number of aerobes and bacteroidaseae, were significantly lower in rats fed gbf than in the control group. it is suggested that the therapeutic effects of gbf for dss-induced colitis depend mainly on increased scfas, which are accompanied by changes of composition of intestinal bacteria.

TI  == importance of intestinal colonisation in the maturation of humoral immunity in early infancy: a prospective follow up study of healthy infants aged 0-6 months.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the role of intestinal microflora and early formula feeding in the maturation of humoral immunity in healthy newborn infants. study design: sixty four healthy infants were studied. faecal colonisation with bacteroides fragilis group, bifidobacterium-like, and lactobacillus-like bacteria was examined at 1, 2, and 6 months of age, and also the number of iga-secreting, igm-secreting, and igg-secreting cells (detected by elispot) at 0, 2, and 6 months of age. results: intestinal colonisation with bacteria from the b fragilis group was more closely associated with maturation of iga-secreting and igm-secreting cells than colonisation with the other bacterial genera studied or  diet. infants colonised with b fragilis at 1 month of age had more iga-secreting  and igm-secreting cells/10(6) mononuclear cells at 2 months of age (geometric mean (95% confidence interval) 1393 (962 to 2018) and 754 (427 to 1332) respectively) than infants not colonised (1015 (826 to 1247) and 394 (304 to 511) respectively); p = 0.04 and p = 0.009 respectively. conclusions: the type of bacteria colonising the intestine of newborns and the timing may determine the immunomodulation of the naive immune system.

TI  == review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  == published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. the studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against gram-positive anaerobes (clostridium perfringens, all peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against gram-negative anaerobes. bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides tectum and many bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/l, while the other species of the b. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. species variability was evident: porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas macaccae, prevotella heparinolytica and prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/l  of gemifloxacin while most other porphyromonas and prevotella spp. were not. these data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some prevotella and porphyromonas spp.  may predominate.

TI  == linezolid.
AB  == linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent that acts by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis. cross-resistance between linezolid and other inhibitors of protein synthesis has not been demonstrated. linezolid has a  wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. anerobes such as clostridium spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. are also susceptible to linezolid. linezolid is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms but displays bactericidal activity against some strains of pneumococci, bacteroides fragilis and c. perfringens. in clinical trials involving hospitalised patients with skin/soft tissue infections (predominantly s. aureus), intravenous/oral linezolid (up to 1250 mg mg/day) produced clinical success in >83% of individuals. in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, success rates were >94%. preliminary clinical data also indicate that twice daily intravenous/oral linezolid 600 mg is as effective as intravenous vancomycin 1 g in the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and in those with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. moreover, linezolid 600 mg twice daily produced >85% clinical/microbiological cure in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. linezolid is generally well tolerated and gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly occurring adverse events. no clinical evidence of adverse reactions as a result of monoamine oxidase inhibition has been reported.

TI  == antibacterial properties of kwazulu natal snake venoms.
AB  == the objective was to ascertain whether local snake venoms have antibacterial properties. the venoms of the common night adder (causus rhombeatus), gaboon adder (bitis gabonica), puff adder (bitis arietans), black mamba (dendroaspis polylepis), eastern green mamba (dendroaspis augusticeps), forest cobra (naja melanoleuca), snouted cobra (naja annulifera) and mozambique spitting cobra (naja mossambica) were collected and, by gel diffusion, tested against the bacteria staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeriginosa, bacteriodes fragilis, bacteroides intermedius, clostridium sordellii and clostridium perfringens. all snake venoms showed antibacterial activity, with the adders showing most activity against the aerobes while the cobras showed lesser, but equal activity against the aerobes and anaerobes. black mamba venom only showed activity against c. perfringens. in conclusion, local snake venoms have antibacterial properties which are dependent on the venom and bacterial type; and in the naja spp., for anaerobic bacteria, diminish in winter. there is liable to  be more than one toxin component responsible.

TI  == susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in auckland: 1991-1996.
AB  == aim: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of local anaerobic bacteria. method: the antimicrobial susceptibility of 357 obligate anaerobes collected between 1991 and 1997 was determined by a standard agar dilution method. isolates tested included bacteroides spp. 131, fusobacterium spp. 12, prevotella spp. 13,  veillonella spp. 5, clostridium perfringens 27, other clostridium spp. 29, propionibacterium spp. 57, actinomyces spp. 7, other non-sporing gram-positive bacilli 28 and peptostreptococcus spp. 48. ten antimicrobials were tested: penicillin, amoxycillin/ clavulanic acid, pipercillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, cefotetan, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. results: imipenem, pipercillin/tazobactam, meropenem and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were active against virtually all anaerobes tested. metronidazole was active against all anaerobic gram-negative bacteria and clostridium spp., but had variable activity against other anaerobes. cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against bacteroides spp., with 76%, 64% and 15% of bacteroides spp. being susceptible to cefoxitin, cefotetan and ceftriaxone, respectively. penicillin had poor activity against anaerobic gram negative bacilli. actinomyces and propionibacterium spp. were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested except metronidazole. variable results were obtained with other antimicrobial-organism combinations. comparison of results with data from a previously published survey  showed little change in susceptibility except for increased resistance of bacteroides fragilis to ceftriaxone and clostridium species (not c perfringens) to clindamycin. conclusion: our results update the local susceptibility profile of anaerobic bacteria and may be considered when choosing an antimicrobial agent  for prophylaxis or treatment of anaerobic infections.

TI  == human gamma delta t cells recognize alkylamines derived from microbes, edible plants, and tea: implications for innate immunity.
AB  == approximately 4% of peripheral blood t cells in humans express a t cell receptor  with markedly restricted germline gene segment usage (v gamma 2 v delta 2). remarkably, these t cells expand 2- to 10-fold (8%-60% of all circulating t cells) during many microbial infections. we show here that these t cells recognize a family of naturally occurring primary alkylamines in a tcr-dependent  manner. these antigenic alkylamines are secreted to millimolar concentrations in  bacterial supernatants and are found in certain edible plants. given the large numbers of memory v gamma 2 v delta 2 t cells in adult humans, recognition of alkylamine antigens offers the immune system a response of the magnitude of major superantigens for alpha beta t cells and may bridge the gap between innate and adaptive immunity.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. mics of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. the activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (mic50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/l) than previously reported for ofloxacin. as seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and  pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (mic 1-8 mg/l). mics for pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/l. levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; mic 0.06-0.25 mg/l), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; mic 1-32 mg/l). haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (mics 0.016-0.03 mg/l, 0.03-0.12 mg/l) and 0.03-0.12 mg/l, respectively). clostridium perfringens (n = 23; mic 0.25-1 mg/l) was more susceptible than bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; mic 0.5-4 mg/l). levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci (n = 107; mic 0.03-0.5 mg/l); the resistant strains (mics 2-32 mg/l) were usually also resistant to methicillin. levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; mic 1-32 mg/l), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (mics 0.5-2 mg/l). according to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for mics of 1, 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. in conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin  compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.

TI  == human diseases caused by exotoxins produced by anaerobes and their rapid detection.
AB  == major human diseases caused by exotoxins produced by anaerobes include botulisms, tetanus, foodborne illness caused by enterotoxin-producing clostridium perfringens, and diarrhea/colitis caused by toxigenic clostridium difficile. recently, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) has been recognized, that may be related to childhood diarrheal disease. detection test of botulinal neurotoxin is hardly performed at clinical laboratories since the most reliable means of detection and identification of botulinal toxin is by using mouse toxicity and neutralization tests. clinical laboratories should request the tests to a reference laboratory. since tetanus is easily diagnosed clinically on the basis of its unique, recognizable sings, the bacteriological tests is not usually requested. c. perfringens foodborne illness can be confirmed by testing stool specimens or the suspect food(s) for enterotoxin by the reversed passive latex agglutination test or counting > 10 5 c. perfringens per g of suspected food or > 10 6 c. perfringens spores per g of stool. diagnosis of c. difficile-associated diarrhea/colitis is confirmed by detection of toxins a or b of c. difficile and/or recovery of toxigenic c. difficile. isolation of c. difficile strains or detection c. difficile-speciffic antigen from stool specimens is less diagnostic  since nontoxic or toxin a positive-toxin b negative strains are prevalent in japan. reliable laboratory tests for etbf-associated childhood diarrhea are not established yet although etbf can be proved by polymerase chain reaction for detection of the enterotoxin gene.

TI  == ecological and physiological studies on large intestinal bacteria in relation to  production of hydrolytic and reductive enzymes involved in formation of genotoxic metabolites.
AB  == several hydrolytic and reductive bacterial enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, gn; beta-glucosidase, gs; arylsulphatase, as; azoreductase, ar; nitroreductase, nr) involved in production of mutagenic or genotoxic metabolites were measured in human colonic contents. cell-associated as and extracellular gs were approximately twice as high in the distal colon compared with the proximal bowel, while ar changed little throughout the gut. measurements of these enzymes in faeces from seven healthy donors confirmed that the majority were cell-associated, and demonstrated high levels of inter-individual variability. nr decreased four-fold between the proximal and distal colon while extracellular gn  was reduced by 50%. most probable number (mpn) analysis on faeces obtained from six healthy donors showed that counts of intestinal bacteria producing gs and ar  were c. 10(10) and 10(11)/g, respectively, in all samples tested. numbers of gn-  and as-forming organisms were between two and three orders of magnitude lower. inter-individual carriage rates of bacterial populations synthesising nr were highly variable. screening of 20 pure cultures of intestinal bacteria, belonging  to six different genera, showed that bacteroides ovatus, in particular, synthesised large amounts of gs, whereas b. fragilis, b. vulgatus and bifidobacterium pseudolongum formed the highest cell-associated levels of gn. in  general, bifidobacteria and lactobacillus acidophilus did not produce significant amounts of ar. all five clostridia studied (clostridium bifermentans, c. septicum, c. perfringens, c. sporogenes and c. butyricum) produced nr and ar, as  did the bacteroides (b. fragilis, b. ovatus and b. vulgatus). escherichia coli and c. perfringens formed large amounts of nr. levels of as production were invariably low and few of the organisms screened synthesised this enzyme. in-vitro studies investigating the effect of intestinal transit time on enzyme production, in a three-stage (v1-v3) continuous culture model of the colon operated at system retention times (r) of either 31.1 or 68.4 h, showed that specific activities of gs were up to four-fold higher (v3) at r = 31.1 h. bacteriological analysis demonstrated that representative populations of colonic  micro-organisms were maintained in the fermentation system, and indicated that changes in gs activity were not related to numbers of the predominant anaerobic or facultative anaerobic species within the model, but were explainable on the basis of substrate-induced modulation of bacterial metabolism.

TI  == mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285, clostridium clostridiiforme atcc 25537, c. perfringens atcc 13124, c. paraputrificum atcc 25780, escherichia coli atcc 25922, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047, salmonella typhimurium ta98 and s. typhimurium yg1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth. neither bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697 nor lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. the inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl  gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. the growth of e. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. neither b. infantis nor l. acidophilus require iron for  growth. this probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of men 10700, a novel penem, was compared with that of imipenem, ritipenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin against 1088 strains taken from 21 genera, including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that men 10700 was very active against staphylococci and streptococci (mic90 < or = 0.5 mg/l) and against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mic90 < or = 2 mg/l), with reduced activity only against providencia stuartii (mic90 = 8 mg/l). men 10700 was also active against  anaerobic species such as clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis as well as moraxella catarrhalis. it was moderately active against enterococcus faecalis and inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. its antibacterial spectrum was thus slightly narrower than that of imipenem, but compared favourably with those  of a third-generation cephalosporin and ritipenem. men 10700 was highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases and was a poor inducer of class i enzymes. it bound penicillin-binding protein 2 with the highest affinity and easily permeated the outer membrane of escherichia coli.

TI  == cell-free whey from milk fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 used to modify  the colonic microflora of healthy subjects.
AB  == the ingestion of viable bacteria is thought to be required to modify intestinal microflora. in the present study, the effects on fecal flora of consumption of cell-free concentrated whey from milk that had been fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 was tested using 10 healthy human volunteers. results were compared with effects of a commercial milk formula that had been fermented with streptococcus thermophilus and b. breve c50 and given to 10 control subjects. nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase activities were assessed as risk  indexes for colon carcinogenesis, and beta-galactosidase was measured as an indicator of the fermentation capacity of the colonic flora. fecal excretion of bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and clostridial spores decreased after 7 d of consumption of either preparation; however, counts of bifidobacteria only increased after intake of b. breve whey. fecal ph was reduced from 7.1 +/- 0.2 to 6.6 +/- 0.3 after intake of whey that had been fermented with bif. breve.  fecal nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase significantly decreased, and beta-galactosidase activity increased, after consumption of either preparation. the results indicate that ingestion of viable bifidobacteria was not required to  modify intestinal flora of humans. repression of b. fragilis and clostridia seems to be independent of colonic bifidobacterial overgrowth in humans.

TI  == "resultant bond moment" as a newly developed electronic parameter in the design of antibacterial, antiprotozoal nitroimidazole derivatives.
AB  == nineteen nitroimidazole derivatives have been reported to be effective antibacterial against one strain each of bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens. the negative logarithms of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics)  of these nitroimidazoles were fitted by a biostatistical relation involving a newly designed structural descriptor, the resultant bond moment (rbm). rbm was developed on the basis of the chemical attribute of bond moments of heteroatoms.  rbm reflects the electronic characteristic of the molecule. apart from this, steric, electronic, and hydrophobic parameters were also utilised in the search of a best fit regression equation. on the basis of these equations new investigative nitroimidazole derivatives have been predicted concerning their antibacterial and antiprotozoal efficacy.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-834, a novel oral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-834 is a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic. this compound is an ester-type prodrug of the active metabolite r-95867. the antibacterial activity of r-95867 was tested against 1,323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was compared with those of oral cephems, i.e., cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. r-95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of  activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the  bacterial species tested. r-95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, clostridium perfringens, neisseria spp., moraxella  catarrhalis, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae (mic at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =0.006 to 0.78 microg/ml). r-95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteroides fragilis. r-95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and escherichia coli. penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of s. aureus and 1bs, 2, 3, and 4 of e. coli had high affinities for r-95867. the in vivo efficacy of cs-834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. the efficacy of cs-834 was in many cases superior to those of cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, e. coli, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris. among the drugs tested, cs-834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon.
AB  == the effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane (aom)-induced aberrant crypt foci (acf) and dna adducts in the rat colon was investigated. male sprague-dawley rats were administered cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens for five weeks and given injections of aom at 15 mg/kg body weight at the first and second weeks. the number of acf five weeks after the start of the experiment was decreased in the rats treated with the cultures or culture supernatants of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens. the half-life of o6-methylguanine (o6-meg) in the l. acidophilus group was shorter than that in the gam broth group. the half-life of 7-methylguanine did not differ among the groups. these results suggest that the metabolite(s) of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens inhibit(s) the acf formation in rats treated with aom and that the inhibitory effect of l. acidophilus is due to the enhanced removal of o6-meg from the colon mucosal dna.

TI  == the effect of in vitro bacterial association on virulence of entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == when trophozoites of axenic e. histolytica strains nih : 200 were associated in vitro with escherichia coli k12 for three hours at 37 degrees c, the virulence was enhanced as shown by increased cytopathogenicity to baby hamster kidney (bhk) cell monolayer. further, the trophozoites were observed to adhere to the polystyrene surface, a hitherto unreported phenomenon. the co-association of e. histolytica trophozoites with bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens for three hours duration at 37 degrees c neither led to increase in cytotoxicity  potential nor to adherence phenomenon; in contrast significant inhibition of cytotoxicity was observed. we have thus shown that while co-association of e. histolytica (nih : 200) with e. coli k12 leads to enhanced amoebic virulence, that with anaerobic bacteric leads to its inhibition.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mics <  or = 4 mg/l), with reduced activity against serratia spp. (mic90 = 32 mg/l). in common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic > 128 mg/l). faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for mrsa mics were raised (mic90 = 2 mg/l) compared with those for mssa (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l). faropenem was also found to be  active against streptococci, neisseria spp., enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis. of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and clostridium perfringens (mic90 < or = 1 mg/l) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l). an increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem mics for morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l and for mrsa from 0.25-2 mg/l to 8 mg/l (a similar increase was not observed for mssa). the mics of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. mics for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. in hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases,  including tem-1, shv-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, tem-3 and tem-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by staphylococcus aureus (nctc 11561).

TI  == effect of lactulose on short-chain fatty acids and lactate production and on the  growth of faecal flora, with special reference to clostridium difficile.
AB  == lactulose exerts a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy by decreasing toxic short-chain (ic4-nc6) fatty acid (isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate, valerate, isocaproate and caproate) production. however, the precise mechanism by which lactulose exerts this effect remains uncertain. this study investigated the effect of lactulose on faecal flora, particularly clostridium difficile, which produces mostly ic4-nc6 fatty acids. an in-vitro faecal incubation system was used to estimate how lactulose influences production of short-chain (c2-nc6) fatty acids and lactate. faecal specimens were collected from patients with liver cirrhosis, who carried c. difficile in the colon. supplementation of lactulose along with blood in faecal specimens decreased ic4-nc6 fatty acids production and increased acetate and lactate production, resulting in increased faecal acidity.  these changes were statistically significant when compared with supplementation by blood alone. quantitative faecal culture demonstrated that lactulose supplementation suppressed the growth of c. difficile and bacteroides spp. (b. fragilis group), ic4-nc6 fatty acids-producing organisms. these results suggest that decreased faecal levels of ic4-nc6 fatty acids after lactulose supplementation may be related to suppression of ic4-nc6 fatty acids-producing faecal organisms, especially c. difficile.

TI  == emerging resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents in south korea.
AB  == in previous studies, bacteroides fragilis group organisms isolated from korean patients were more frequently resistant to various antimicrobial agents, including clindamycin, than were isolates in other countries. a recent report of  increased resistance of peptostreptococcus species prompted us to include such isolates in a study of antimicrobial susceptibility. anaerobes isolated in 1994 at a tertiary care hospital in seoul were tested by agar dilution method. none of the b. fragilis group organisms were resistant to imipenem, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, or metronidazole. however, 6.7% were resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, 20.2% to cefotetan, 30.3% to piperacillin, 48.3% to cefotaxime, and 42.7% to clindamycin. almost all of the clostridium perfringens isolates were susceptible to all of the agents tested, except tetracycline. peptostreptococcus isolates were susceptible to piperacillin, cefotaxime, and imipenem, while 7.4% were resistant to penicillin g, cefotetan, and metronidazole, and 25.9% were resistant to clindamycin. the isolates resistant to penicillin g, cefotetan, and metronidazole were identified as peptostreptococcus  anaerobius. in conclusion, besides the well-known high rate of resistance of b. fragilis group organisms to clindamycin, the emergence of resistance of peptostreptococcus species isolates to beta-lactam drugs has become obvious in korea.

AB  == as recommended by the eec, the in vitro activity of a veterinary quinolone has to be evaluated on human strains isolated from the gut and especially against anaerobes. thus, the mics for marbofloxacin were determined by the reference agar method (norma nccls m11 a3) using wilkins chalgren medium for the 124 anaerobic strains and mueller hinton agar for e. coli, proteus, enterococcus and lactobacillus. on the whole aerobes, the activity of marbofloxacin was equal or slightly greater to that of ofloxacin. the modal mic was 0.03 mg/l for enterobacteriaceae, 2 mg/l and 16 mg/l for enterococcus and lactobacillus strains, respectively. considering the anti-anaerobic activity of this new drug,  in comparison with that of ofloxacin, mics for ofloxacin were generally one log2  higher for gram negative bacilli and two log2 higher for gram positive bacilli. modal mics for marbofloxacin were 0.12 mg/l for clostridium perfringens, 0.5 mg/l for bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus strains, 1 mg/l for bifidobacteria, 2 mg/l for non-fragilis members of the b. fragilis group, and 4 mg/l for c. difficile strains, respectively. it appears in  vitro that marbofloxacin was a more potent agent than ofloxacin on the whole anaerobes.

AB  == background: t-tube-related bacteriobilia causes infectious complications and obstruction. to prevent these, the choice of t-tube material may be of importance. methods: transected common bile ducts (cbds) of 17 piglets were sutured over latex or silicone t-tubes, or without a t-tube. results: after 6 weeks bacteriobilia was found in all of 12 cbds with and in 1 of 5 cbds without a t-tube (p < 0.05). by scanning electron microscopy (sem) four of five latex and none of five silicone t-tubes had bacterial biofilms (p < 0.05). all tubes remained patent. segments of t-tubes were incubated with five different bacterial strains. sonication and sem showed that 0.1-1.1% of 10(7) colony-forming units of inoculum adhered to t-tubes. two to six times more bacteria adhered to latex than to silicone (p < 0.05). conclusions: silicone offers better long-term patency than latex. less infectious complications occur if t-tubes are omitted.

TI  == recent advances in antibiotic regimens for the treatment of obstetric-gynecologic infections.
AB  == this paper reviews new information on antimicrobial agents for the treatment of obstetric-gynecologic infections. the bacteriology of these infections is complex, reflecting the bacteria that usually colonize the vagina and cervix. in  general, these infections are polymicrobial in nature: the most frequently isolated microorganisms are gram-negative facultative aerobes, anaerobes, chlamydia trachomatis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. antibiotic regimens that do provide coverage of these pathogens showed unacceptably high failure rates. a review of the studies recently published confirmed the recommendations of the us  centers for disease control and prevention for severe (inpatients) and mild-to-moderate (outpatients) pelvic inflammatory disease infections. in the case of severe infections, two regimens are recommended: a second-generation cephalosporin like cefoxitin or cefotetan, plus doxycycline or clindamycin/gentamicin. in the case of mild-to-moderate infection, a second- or third-generation cephalosporin plus doxycycline, or oral clindamycin plus an oral quinolone are recommended. such studies produce high bacteriologic and clinical success rates. new studies indicate that gentamicin may be replaced with a monobactam such as aztreonam; this regimen leads to slightly better efficacy and  less toxicity. the possibility of using clindamycin and a quinolone antibiotic is also discussed.

AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay y 3118, and nine other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone, was determined against 257 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activities of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, and ornidazole. overall, bay y 3118  was the most active agent tested against the bacteroides fragilis group. its activity (mic90, 0.5 mg/l) was 16-fold lower than that of sparfloxacin (mic90, 8  mg/l), and more than 100-fold lower than that of ofloxacin (mic90, 64 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 128 mg/l) against the group. no strains belonging to this group were resistant to metronidazole (mics range, 0.12-2 mg/l) and ornidazole (mics range, 0.12-4 mg/l). bay y 3118 was more active than those quinolones against prevotella and porphyromonas spp., fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and c. difficile (mic90, 0.12, 0.06, 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). the activity of bay y 3118 against peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 1 mg/l) was slightly lower than that of the other gram-positive bacteria tested.  in general, bay y 3118 was more active than cefoxitin, and it was superior to antianaerobic chemical agents like metronidazole, ornidazole and clindamycin. pharmacokinetic and clinical trials are required to define the role of bay y 3118 in the treatment of anaerobic infections.

TI  == postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  == studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. the rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees c, ranged from 0.1 ng/ml/min for streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/ml/min for clostridium perfringens. the rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. ph had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing  temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. these data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.

TI  == bioavailability and bacterial degradation of rectally administered 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine.
AB  == 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (cda) is a new drug for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and other lymphoproliferative diseases. it is generally administered as  a continuous intravenous infusion during 5-7 days. the oral bioavailability is only 50%. the bioavailability after rectal administration was investigated in two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. five milligrams per square metre was  given i.v. as a 2-h infusion and 24 h later the same dose was administered rectally in a gel formulation. the mean bioavailability was only 21% due to deglycosylation of cda to 2-chloroadenine (cade). to further elucidate the factors which are important for the rectal availability of cda, the in vitro stability of cda in bacterial cultures was tested. clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli as well as whole feces rapidly deglycosylated cda to cade while  bacteroides fragilis, enterococcus faecalis as well as saliva only degraded cda slowly or not at all. it is concluded that, due to bacterial degradation, rectal  administration of cda has no advantage over oral administration.

TI  == clostridial infection in children.
AB  == a survey of the isolation of clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. the isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified clostridium spp., 37 (33%) c. perfringens, 13 (12%) c. ramosum, five (4%) c. innocuum, six (5%) c. botulinum, three (3%) c. difficile, two (2%) c. butyricum, and one isolate each of c. bifermentans, c. clostridiiforme, c. limosum and c. paraputrificum. most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. these were  immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). the clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. the species most  commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); bacteroides spp. (b. fragilis group) (50), escherichia coli (22), pigmented prevotella or porphyromonas spp. (18) and fusobacterium spp. (10). most bacteroides and escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck  sites. antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). only two patients died. these data illustrate the  importance of clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.

TI  == e-4695, a new c-7 azetidinyl fluoronaphthyridine with enhanced activity against gram-positive and anaerobic pathogens.
AB  == e-4695, (-)-7-[3-(r)-amino-2-(s)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-1-cyclopropyl-1,4- dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, is a new fluorinated  naphthyridine with an azetidine moiety. the mics of e-4695 at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90s) were 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for gram-positive  cocci, including species of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and the mic90s against gram-negative pathogens such as members of the family enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of providencia spp. [mic90, 8 micrograms/ml]) and pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml. e-4695 inhibited 90% of the clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis isolates at 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. against gram-positive cocci the potency of e-4695 was 2- to 8-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin, 4- to 8-fold higher than that of ofloxacin, and 8- to 16-fold higher than that of fleroxacin. against enteric bacteria and p. aeruginosa the potency of e-4695 was, in general, similar to that of ciprofloxacin and eightfold higher than those of ofloxacin and fleroxacin. e-4695 was four- and eightfold more potent than ciprofloxacin against c. perfringens and b. fragilis isolates, respectively. e-4695 and ciprofloxacin showed similar properties when the effects of ph or magnesium concentration were  tested on them. e-4695 and ciprofloxacin had substantial reductions of activity only when ph decreased below 4.8. e-4695 and ciprofloxacin activities were not markedly affected by the presence of 5 or 10 mm mg2+. the presence of serum and human urine at ph 7.2 decreased the activity of e-4695 between two- and fourfold. after an oral dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum level in serum, the biological half-life, and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 10 h for e-4695 were 13.2 microgram/ml, 3.3 h, and 45.6 microgram . h/ml, respectively. the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 h for ciprofloxacin was 2.3 microgram . h/ml at the same dose. fifty-percent effective  doses (ed50s) against staphylococcus aureus hs-93 infections in mice were 4.5 mg/kg with e-4695 and 37.6 mg/kg with ciprofloxacin. infection with streptococcus pneumoniae 29206 was more effectively treated with e-4695 (ed50, 41,2 mg/kg) than with ciprofloxacin (ed50, 200 mg/kg). the ed50 of e-4695 for infections with streptococcus pneumoniae 1625 was 132.2 mg/kg; ciprofloxacin was ineffective at 400 mg/kg against this strain. e-4695 was also more potent than ciprofloxacin in  treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms such as escherichia coli hm-42 (ed50s, 1.0 and 3.9 mg/kg, respectively). the ed50s of e-4695 and ciprofloxacin were 33.0 and 145.5 mg/kg against p. aeruginosa hs-116 and 9.6 and  18.9 mg/kg against p. aeruginosa b-120, respectively. the therapeutic efficacy of e-4695 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its improved pharmacokinetic properties.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

TI  == effect of distance from the polluting focus on relative concentrations of bacteroides fragilis phages and coliphages in mussels.
AB  == concentrations of fecal bacteria, somatic and f-specific coliphages, and phages infecting bacteroides fragilis in naturally occurring black mussels (mytilus edulis) were determined. mussels were collected over a 7-month period at four sampling sites with different levels of fecal pollution. concentrations of both fecal bacteria and bacteriophages in mussel meat paralleled the concentration of  fecal bacteria in the overlying waters. mussels bioaccumulated efficiently, although with different efficiencies, all of the microorganisms studied. ratios comparing the levels of microorganisms in mussels were determined. these ratios changed in mussels collected at the different sites. they suggest that bacteriophages infecting b. fragilis and somatic coliphages have the lowest decay rates among the microorganisms studied, with the exception of clostridium perfringens. on the contrary, concentrations of f-specific coliphages showed a greater rate of decay than the other bacteriophages at sites more distant from the focus of contamination. additionally, levels of enteroviruses were studied in a number of samples, and in these samples, the b. fragilis bacteriophages clearly outnumbered the enteroviruses. the results of this study indicate that, under the environmental conditions studied, the fate of phages infecting b. fragilis released into the marine environment resembles that of human viruses more than any other microorganism examined.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ici 194660, cas 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. they included bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), prevotella bivia (n = 11), fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated  species and genera, e.g. selenomonas sputigena and clostridium symbiosum. bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, clostridium species, including c. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all  the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. meropenem was especially active against bacteroides gracilis (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), prevotella disiens (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml), fusobacterium nucleatum (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), clostridium perfringens (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml) and veillonella parvula (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml). the results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.

TI  == anaerobic susceptibility testing. slight differences in inoculum size can make a  difference in minimum inhibitory concentrations.
AB  == in the present study, we compared the actual inoculum density from inoculated broth microdilution wells to the targeted inoculum size (10(5) cfu/well) when the inoculum was prepared using a mcfarland nephelometer to achieve the standard density. three target inoculum sizes (10(5), 5 x 10(5), and 10(6) cfu/well) were  used to compare the effect of slight inoculum size increases of both atcc and clinical strains of anaerobes on mics of various antimicrobials. actual colony counts of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, eubacterium lentum, and veillonella parvula ranged from 0.7 x 10(5) to 1.4 x 10(5) cfu/well. as the inoculum size rose above the desired 10(5) cfu/well level, the mics of certain antimicrobials became elevated. ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone mics rose 4- to 16-fold with as little as 0.5 log10 increase in inoculum size. other increases were also noted with e. lentum and clostridium perfringens, but were primarily between the low and high inoculum sizes. results with cefoxitin, cefotetan, mezlocillin, and imipenem did not show an appreciable increased inoculum effect. this study demonstrates that the variation in organism size among anaerobes (both between species and within species) does make a difference  in actual inoculum size and certain anaerobes may require special adjustment to ensure proper mic results from susceptibility testing.

AB  == a prospective study was designed to investigate anaerobic bacteremias and evaluate their incidence and significance in a general hospital. one or more blood cultures positive for anaerobic microorganisms were analyzed from each of a total of 61 patients hospitalized between january 1988 and april 1992, in accordance with an established protocol. the clinical repercussions of bacteremia were also analyzed. two percent of blood cultures were positive for anaerobes, with an incidence of 0.6 cases per 1000 hospitalized patients. the most frequently isolated anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens. intraabdominal disease was the route of entry in 50% of the patients. a death rate of 37.3% was mostly attributed to b. fragilis. hospitalization in the surgical department, nosocomial acquisition, previous surgery, critical initial clinical status and the presence of complications were  significantly associated with increased death rates. no significant differences were found in the clinical course between patients whose antibiotic treatment was judged adequate and those for whom it was considered inadequate. the frequency and incidence of anaerobic bacteremia was low in our hospital. the well-known clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these infections facilitates their prompt diagnosis and empirical treatment with antibiotics of proven effectiveness against anaerobes.

TI  == how far should a clinical laboratory go in identifying anaerobic isolates, and who should pay?
AB  == identification of anaerobic bacteria in specimens from sites of infection due to  mixed organisms can be time-consuming and expensive. laboratories should limit anaerobic workups by testing only those specimens that have been properly collected and transported to the laboratory. use of selective and differential media for initial processing can provide rapid and relevant information to the clinician. anaerobes isolated from normally sterile sites and sites of serious infection should always be completely identified. group- or genus-level identifications may suffice in other instances. the bacteroides fragilis group of organisms should always be identified because of their virulence and resistance to many antimicrobial agents. some of the other organisms that warrant identification include clostridium septicum (associated with gastrointestinal malignancy); clostridium ramosum, clostridium innocuum, and clostridium clostridioforme (which are resistant to antibiotics); clostridium perfringens (a  cause of potentially serious infection); anaerobic cocci (which may be resistant  to metronidazole and clindamycin); and fusobacteria (which may be virulent and resistant to clindamycin and penicillin).

TI  == patterns of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among anaerobic bacterial isolates in the united states.
AB  == the activity of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria has generally been moderate to poor. nalidixic acid and cinoxacin show poor activity  against almost all anaerobes. norfloxacin and enoxacin exhibit poor anaerobic activity (mic90, 8- > 256 micrograms/ml) except against clostridium perfringens,  bacteroides ureolyticus, and some eubacteria. norfloxacin is slightly more active than enoxacin against some bacteroides species. while ciprofloxacin is more active than earlier fluoroquinolones against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 4-16 micrograms/ml), fusobacteria, and peptostreptococci, its activity is often variable and its mic90 is frequently close to the maximal level attainable in serum. ofloxacin is active against b. fragilis (mic90, 4-8 micrograms/ml) but not against other species of the b. fragilis group (mic90, 8-32 micrograms/ml); other anaerobes (e.g., peptostreptococci and fusobacteria) are generally susceptible to < or = 8 micrograms of ofloxacin/ml. several newer quinolones exhibit improved anaerobic activity (although the studies yielding relevant data have often used diverse methods, small numbers and varieties of isolates, and different breakpoints). ci-960 and win 57273 inhibit 95% of strains tested at < or = 2 micrograms/ml. ci-990, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin inhibit  most anaerobes at < or = 2 micrograms/ml, but clustering around the breakpoint and strain variability have been noted. ci-990 is active against more than 85% of b. fragilis strains (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), but other species of the b. fragilis group often require > 4 micrograms/ml for inhibition; prevotella bivia,  fusobacterium varium, and fusobacterium ulcerans are usually resistant.(abstract  truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effect of hyperbaric oxygen and surgery on experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene.
AB  == an experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene rat model was developed and the therapeutic effect of surgery was compared to the combined effect of surgery and  hyperbaric oxygen (hbo). the infection was caused by an intramuscular injection of a mixture of bacteria including clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. the mortality, morbidity and wound healing were assessed during a follow-up of 2 weeks. the mortality of the control rats was 60%, with rats treated with surgery alone 35% and the combined treatment group 20% (ns). in the combined treatment group, 84.4% of the survivors healed completely; the corresponding figure in the surgery group was 15.4% (p < 0.001).  in experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene the addition of hbo to surgery reduces morbidity and improves wound healing but does not reduce mortality statistically significantly.

TI  == hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of gas gangrene and perineal necrotizing fasciitis. a clinical and experimental study.
AB  == between 1971 and 1987, 32 patients with clostridial gas gangrene were treated in  the department of surgery, university of turku. a presumptive diagnosis of gas gangrene was made on the basis of the clinical appearance of the patient and a predominance of gram positive rods on stain. between 1973 and 1989, 11 patients with perineal necrotizing fasciitis (fournier's gangrene) were treated. the diagnosis was based on fulminating progression of perineal gangrene and on the presence of multiple pathogenic organisms in the primary gram stain or culture. all patients in both series underwent surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy, and intensive care. in addition, the patients were exposed to pure oxygen at 2.5  atmospheres absolute pressure (ata) for 120 minutes. three such treatments were given during the first 24 hours after admission after which the treatment was repeated twice daily. seventeen patients with clostridial gas gangrene had diffusely spreading myonecrosis; 6 died. fifteen patients developed clostridial cellulitis with toxicity; 3 died. thus, the overall mortality in gas gangrene was 28%. all the 9 patients who died had been transferred from other hospitals in finland and were moribund on arrival. the infection in 8 of these patients developed postoperatively. none of the patients with a posttraumatic infection died. each of the patients with fournier's gangrene had had nonspecific symptoms  before the gangrene became evident. the infection originated from the anorectal area in 5 patients, 1 patient had sustained a scrotal trauma and in 5 patients the underlying condition was unknown. one patient died 2 days after admission. six patients required a colostomy. to evaluate the therapeutic value of hyperbaric oxygen (hbo) treatment, two experimental models of clostridial gas gangrene, mono- and multimicrobial, were developed in rats. in the monomicrobial  infection model, 10(7) colony forming units (cfu) of clostridium perfringens were injected intramuscularly into the left hind limb of the rat. the mortality of untreated rats was 100%. the mortality of the rats treated with surgery alone was 38% compared to 13% when surgery was used in combination with hbo (p < 0.01; chi  2 test). in the group treated with hbo and surgery, 94% of the survivors healed completely and were able to walk normally, whereas the corresponding figure in the rats treated with surgery alone was 20% (p < 0.001; chi 2-test). in the multimicrobial gas gangrene model the infection was induced by an intramuscular injection of a mixture containing approximately 10(7) cfu of each of the following bacteria: clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c in two different transport systems.
AB  == the survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c was evaluated. the transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified stuart transport medium (mst), and a viscose swab in modified siff transport medium (btm) (bionor). the following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; fusobacterium necrophorum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides intermedius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, clostridium perfringens, clostridium tetani, and actinomyces  israelii. additionally, a mixture of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was tested together with bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium necrophorum and clostridium perfringens. both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the btm medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the mst in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%)  of the experiments (p < 0.05). there was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different b. fragilis strains. there was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees c compared to 22 degrees c, except for fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees c in the bionor transport system.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria isolated in johannesburg.
AB  == in vitro susceptibilities of 198 anaerobic bacteria to seven antibiotics were evaluated by the agar dilution method. in addition to testing amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in a 2:1 ratio against the bacteria, the combination  was also tested against 63 isolates using fixed concentrations of clavulanic acid and serial dilutions of amoxycillin. penicillin and cefoxitin were not effective  against beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides isolates and only 50% of isolates were susceptible to the 2:1 amoxycillin/clavulanic acid combination. however, when varying concentrations of amoxycillin were used together with constant concentrations of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml) only 9 of 55 amoxycillin-resistant bacteroides were resistant to the combination. two clostridia were found to produce beta-lactamases and as expected were resistant to penicillin. of the non-beta-lactamase-producing clostridia 11% were resistant  to penicillin and 5% resistant to cefoxitin. imipenem was effective against the majority of anaerobes tested and only 5 bacteroides isolates were resistant. all  anaerobic strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol and only 6% of strains resistant to clindamycin. eighty-five per cent and 51% of bacteroides strains had minimum inhibitory concentrations within two dilutions of the breakpoints of chloramphenicol (16 micrograms/ml) and clindamycin (4 micrograms/ml) respectively. three strains of peptostreptococcus spp. were resistant to metronidazole.

TI  == the characterization of nonbacterial prostatitis: search for an etiology.
AB  == nonbacterial prostatitis is often difficult to differentiate from other prostatic complaints and remains a vaguely characterized syndrome. prostatic fluid inflammatory cells and elevated immunoglobulins raise the suspicion that this syndrome is caused by some undetected infection. prostatic fluid antibodies against chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, staphylococcus, staphylococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens were measured in men with nonbacterial and bacterial prostatitis, and men without urinary symptoms by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase were measured in the prostatic fluid as indirect measures of secretory activity. of 44 men with nonbacterial prostatitis  9 (20%) had detectable prostatic fluid antichlamydial antibody titers, compared with 3 of 25 control men (12%) and 2 of 13 (15%) with bacterial prostatitis--no evidence for a higher prevalence of prostatic fluid antichlamydial antibody in men with nonbacterial prostatitis. prostatic antibodies to the other organisms were rarely detected. when compared with unaffected men the low levels of prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase, and more alkaline prostatic fluid in men with bacterial and nonbacterial prostatitis suggest that secretory dysfunction accompanies the inflammation. these data show that none of  the organisms studied caused the majority of the cases of nonbacterial prostatitis and that either an agent as yet unidentified or multiple agents may be involved in the etiology of nonbacterial prostatitis.

TI  == e-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to validate the epsilometer test (e-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms  using the agar dilution method as a standard. the e-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. the device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential  gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. after 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (ic) of the antibiotic. twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. a total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. the antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. as a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the  agar dilution method. mics were compared with ics determined using the e-test method. the results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. the e-test ics for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and  the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ics for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution mics.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == cloning, sequencing and distribution of the salmonella typhimurium lt2 sialidase  gene, nanh, provides evidence for interspecies gene transfer.
AB  == the salmonella typhimurium lt2 sialidase (neuraminidase, ec 3.2.1.18) structural  gene, nanh, has been cloned and sialidase overproduced from multicopy plasmids in escherichia coli. sialidase expression was regulated positively by camp. in contrast, certain tn1000 insertions located upstream of nanh coding sequences reduced sialidase activity. a nanh chromosomal insertion mutation constructed by  marker exchange demonstrated a single sialidase gene copy in s. typhimurium lt2.  the complete nucleotide sequence of nanh, encoding a 41,300 dalton polypeptide, was determined and the derived primary structure was similar to sialidases from clostridium perfringens, clostridium sordellii, bacteroides fragilis, and trypanosoma cruzi. comparative sequence analysis, including codon usage and secondary structure predictions, indicated that the s. typhimurium and clostridial sialidases are homologous, strongly suggestive of an interspecies gene transfer event. at least two primary sequence motifs of the bacterial enzymes were detected in influenza a virus sialidases. the predicted secondary structure of the bacterial enzymes was strikingly similar to viral sialidase. from the population distribution of nanh detected within a collection of salmonellae, it was apparent that s. typhimurium obtained its nanh copy most recently from salmonella arizonae. s. typhimurium lt2 is thus a genetic mosaic that differs from other strains of even the same serotype by nanh plus potentially additional characters linked to nanh. these results have relevance to the evolution and function of sialidases in pathogenic microbes, and to the origin of the sialic acids.

TI  == nitroimidazoles, part xxiii--activity of satranidazole series against anaerobic infections.
AB  == a large number of nitroimidazoles have been examined for in vitro activity against three anaerobes - bacteroides fragilis (bf), a strain of bf resistant to  metronidazole (16a) and clostridium perfringens and many found to be active. among these may be mentioned 1-methyl-5-nitroimidazoles carrying n - bound hetetocycles at position 2, such as satranidazole 1a, 1b, 1c, 1k, 1n and 1v which are at least twice as active as metronidazole (16a), ornidazole (16b) and tinidazole (16c). even more active are 5-nitroimidazolyl benzimidazole 5d, -thiazolidinone 6b and thiadiazolidine dioxide 8a. many other types of compounds  derived from 1-methyl-2-amino-5-nitroimidazole are feebly active. among 5-nitroimidazoles with a carbon substituent at position 2, 16a, 16b and 16c are equiactive while dimetridazole 14f is more active than 16a against bf. some 2-vinyl derivatives are very potent, with 18f and 18i being outstanding. activity better than that of metronidazole is seen for nitroimidazooxazepines, e.g. 29d. 5-nitroimidazoles are more active against anaerobes than 4-nitro isomers. antianaerobic and antiamoebic activities generally run parallel in these classes  of compounds. the study has led to the elaboration of the antianaerobic profile of satranidazole 1a.

TI  == [bacterial translocation in crohn disease].
AB  == bacterial translocation is the passage of viable endogenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to mesenteric lymph nodes and other internal organs. the aim of this work was to study bacterial translocation in patients operated on for crohn's disease. twenty-eight patients, mean age 29 years, not having received any antibiotics since at least 8 days, presenting with ileal (n = 12), ileo-colonic (n = 14) or colonic (n = 2) crohn's disease were studied. in 25 out  of 28 cases (89%) indication for surgery was strictures inducing an upper small bowel distension in 9 out of 25 patients. mesenteric lymph nodes and liver biopsies, portal blood samples and peritoneum swabs were harvested after laparotomy and before gut opening. bacterial translocation, defined as the presence of intestinal bacteria in at least one of the specimens, was present in  8 out of 28 patients. this was found in lymph nodes draining surgical territories in 7 out of 8 cases. bacterial strains involved in translocation included e. coli (n = 5), enterococcus (n = 3), clostridium perfringens (n = 2), proteus (n = 2),  and bacteroides fragilis (n = 1). the rate of translocation differed neither according to crohn's disease site nor with perforating or non perforating type of the disease. five out of 9 patients operated on for strictures with proximal distension had a translocation. in conclusion, bacterial translocation was identified in 29% of patients operated on for crohn's disease in this series. distension of the intestine proximal to a digestive stricture could favor the occurrence of bacterial translocation in crohn's disease.

TI  == newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  == the improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. several  new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. win 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus spp., corynebacterium spp., listeria monocytogenes and bacillus spp. bmy 40062, pd 117558, pd 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these  species. these drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and the bacteroides fragilis group. mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. in addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against mycobacterium leprae. sparfloxacin, bmy 40062 and win 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. improved antibacterial activity has also been found against mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas maltophilia. by contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including plasmodium spp., trypanosoma cruzi and leishmania donovani, but not against toxoplasma gondii. in the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.

TI  == bacteremia due to anaerobic bacteria in newborns.
AB  == awareness of the role of anaerobic bacteria in neonatal bacteremia has increased  in recent years. the incidence of recovery of anaerobes in neonatal bacteremia varies, according to different studies, between 1.8% and 12.5%. of the 178 cases  reported in the literature, 73 were due to bacteroides species (69 were the bacteroides fragilis group), 57 clostridium species (mostly clostridium perfringens), 35 peptostreptococci, 5 propionibacterium acnes, 3 veillonella species, 3 fusobacterium species, and 2 eubacterium species. predisposing factors were perinatal maternal complications (especially premature rupture of membranes  and chorioamnionitis), prematurity, and necrotizing enterocolitis. organisms similar to those recovered in blood were concomitantly isolated in lung aspirates and cerebrospinal and peritoneal fluids. the overall mortality noted is 26% and is highest with b fragilis group (34%). inappropriate antimicrobial therapy was often a contributory factor for such mortality. correction of underlying pathology, surgical drainage, and the use of proper antimicrobials are critical to successful resolution of the infection. penicillin g is the drug of choice for anaerobic infection other than beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides. antimicrobials useful for therapy of beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides include clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, imipenem-cilastatin, and the combination of a penicillin plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == occlusive dressings. does dressing type influence the growth of common bacterial  pathogens?
AB  == we studied the effect of different occlusive dressings and of air exposure on the growth of four pathogenic bacteria in wounds. partial-thickness wounds on domestic pigs were inoculated with staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. each wound was covered with three dressings (duoderm, opsite, or vigilon), or left exposed to air. groups of wounds were sampled at 24, 48, and 72 hours. staphylococcus aureus reached high levels beneath all of the dressings and in the air-exposed wounds. the numbers of c perfringens and b fragilis were greatly reduced in the air-exposed wounds and slightly reduced in the opsite-covered wounds. the numbers of p aeruginosa were greatest in the opsite- and vigilon-covered wounds. the results indicate that occlusive dressings are not indicated in wounds that clinically appear to be grossly contaminated or that may contain anaerobic organisms.

AB  == this study was set up to establish the regression curve for clarithromycin inhibition zone diameters (disks 15 micrograms) and mic to create a strain distribution plot, in order to allow accurate interpretation of the disk diffusion method for testing susceptibility to clarithromycin. 430 bacterial strains were studied in three university hospital. clarithromycin was active against erythromycin sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci at concentrations of 0.12 to 0.25 microgram/ml (mode 0.25). erythromycin resistant strains were also resistant to clarithromycin. enterococci could be divided into two populations, one resistant (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml) and the other with mic of 0.06 to 2 (mode 0.25). this was also the case for streptococci and pneumococci with mic lower for susceptible strains (mode 0.03 to 0.06). clarithromycin was active on haemophilus at concentrations of 4 to 64 micrograms/ml (mode 16); mics for beta-lactamase producing strains were comparable to those of strains not producing. mics for neisseria were 0.12 to 16 and for b. catarrhalis 0.016 to 0.5. mic were 0.5 and 1 (mode 1) for clostridium perfringens; bacteroides fragilis strains were inhibited by 0.12 to 8 micrograms/ml (mode 0.5-1). so, antibacterial activity of c was similar to that of e; it was sometimes slightly superior, particularly on gram positive cocci. for mic breakpoints of 1 and 4 micrograms/ml, zone size breakpoints should be 23  and 17 mm and for 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, 20 and 15 mm.

TI  == comparative efficacy of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and penicillin g against anaerobic bacteria in an animal model.
AB  == treatment efficacy of various antimicrobial regimens against anaerobes was studied in semipermeable chambers simulating a closed-space, locally neutropenic  infection site in rabbits. bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, clostridium perfringens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were inoculated (at a  mean of 5.3 log10 cfu/ml in prereduced pooled rabbit serum) into the chambers (one isolate per chamber) in triplicate. antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole (against the gram-negative anaerobes), or penicillin g (against the gram-positive anaerobes), beginning 4 hours after organism inoculation and continuing every 6 hours for 16 doses. with the use of anaerobic techniques for specimen acquisition, transport, and culture, quantitative bacterial findings were measured at the start of therapy and at various time points thereafter. antibiotic concentrations were measured in blood and chamber fluid by liquid chromatography or bioassay methods. at the end of the study in vivo organisms were reduced by at least 3 log10 cfu/ml from drug-free growth control chambers by all the antimicrobial regimens tested except for cefoperazone against b. fragilis and ciprofloxacin against the three isolates tested. the addition of sulbactam to cefoperazone inhibited b. fragilis beta-lactamase activity and eradicated b. fragilis in vivo. in vivo results with this model confirmed in vitro susceptibilities of all tested antimicrobials except ciprofloxacin and should provide useful indications of the potential clinical efficacy of other new agents against anaerobes.

AB  == blood cultures with strains of aerobic, facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria were studied by quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early  diagnosis of bacteraemias. small amounts of volatile and nonvolatile fatty acids  were detected in uninoculated blood cultures. bacteroides fragilis produced acetic (27.6 mumol/ml), propionic (1.0 mumol/ml), isovaleric, (0.6 mumol/ml), lactic (4.5 mumol/ml) and succinic (2.7 mumol/ml) acids after 48 h. blood cultures inoculated with clostridium perfringens and fusobacterium nucleatum produced large amount of butyric acid (2.5 and 18.8 mumol/ml respectively) along  with acetic, propionic, lactic and succinic acids on day 2 of incubation. blood cultures with escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (group a) produced only acetic, lactic and succinic  acids. pseudomonas aeruginosa produced only small amounts of succinic (0.6 mumol/ml) and acetic acids (2.4 mumol/ml) on day 5 of incubation. blood cultures  inoculated with anaerobic bacteria produced multiple volatile fatty acids within  24 to 48 h of incubation. since these acids could be detected earlier than the organism in cultures, they may be useful in the early diagnosis of anaerobic bacteraemias/septicaemias.

TI  == influence of ph, nutrient availability, and growth rate on amine production by bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens.
AB  == dimethylamine, methylamine, propylamine, and pyrrolidine were the major amines formed by bacteroides fragilis ncdo 2217 during the active phase of growth in batch culture. production of these metabolites was strongly ph dependent and was  optimal under acidic conditions (ph 6.0). low ph also favored the formation of pyrrolidine, cadaverine, and dimethylamine by clostridium perfringens c523, but the reverse was the case with putrescine, butylamine, and propylamine, where production was maximal at neutral ph. b. fragilis was grown in continuous culture under either starch or casein limitation. amine formation was influenced by carbohydrate availability and was greatest when the bacteria were grown at high growth rates (dilution rate, 0.20/h) under starch limitation, where they constituted about 18% of the total fermentation products measured. amine production was optimal and increased concomitantly with growth rate when c. perfringens was grown in glucose-limited continuous culture. under conditions of  high growth rate and glucose limitation, amines accounted for approximately 27% of the fermentation products measured. when glucose in the feed medium was increased from 5 to 15 g/liter, amine production was repressed, and under these nutritional conditions the growth rate had little effect on the process.

TI  == [in vitro activity of roxithromycin against hospital bacteria and the concordance curve].
AB  == this study was set up to establish the regression curve for roxithromycin inhibition zone diameters (disks 15 micrograms) and mic to create a strain distribution plot, in order to allow accurate interpretation of the disk diffusion method for testing susceptibility to roxithromycin. 373 bacterial strains were studied in three university hospital. roxithromycin was active against erythromycin sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci at concentrations of 0.06 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode 0.5). erythromycin resistant strains were also resistant to roxithromycin. enterococci  could be divided into two populations, one resistant (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml) and the other with mic of 0.5 to 32 (mode 1-2). this was also the  case for streptococci and pneumococci with mic lower for susceptible strains (mode 0.06-0.12). roxithromycin was active on haemophilus at concentrations of 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml; mic for beta-lactamase producing strains were comparable to those of strains not producing. mic for gonococci were low (less than 0.008 to 0.12), except for three strains. they were higher for meningococci  (0.03 to 32) with a majority of strains inhibited by 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml. mic  were 4 for clostridium perfringens; bacteroides fragilis strains were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml. the correlation coefficient for regression curve was 0.79; for critical concentrations less than or equal to 1 and greater than 4 micrograms/ml, critical diameters are greater than or equal to 22 and less than 17 mm.

TI  == clinical evaluation of the vitek ani card for identification of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == an evaluation of the vitek anaerobe identification (ani) card was performed with  341 bacterial isolates, including 313 clinical isolates and 28 stock strains of anaerobic microorganisms. identifications obtained with the ani card were compared with those determined by conventional methods. the card identified 73.2% of 149 anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, 63.6% of 44 clostridium spp., 65.8% of 38 anaerobic nonsporeforming gram-positive bacilli, and 69.1% of 110 anaerobic cocci, with no further testing required. when genus-level identifications were included, 83.9% of the anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, 70.5% of clostridium spp., 73.7% of the anaerobic nonsporeforming gram-positive bacilli, and 73.6% of  the anaerobic cocci were identified. nineteen isolates (5.6%) produced identifications of good confidence but marginal separation or questionable biotype, in which the correct identification was listed with one or two other possible choices and extra tests were required and suggested. a total of 28 (8.2%) were not identified and 29 isolates (8.5%) were misidentified by the ani card. among the commonly isolated clinically significant anaerobes, the ani card  identified 100% of 55 bacteroides fragilis and 100% of 8 clostridium perfringens. use of supplemental tests and expansion of the data base to include additional strains of organisms that are difficult to separate even with conventional methods may improve the accuracy of the ani card as a method for identification of anaerobic bacteria in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  == protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not  have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. thimerosal, iodoacetate, edta  and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by  bacteria in the large gut. these results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed  cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. extracellular proteases  were formed by streptococcus faecalis st6, propionibacterium acnes p6, clostridium perfringens c16, cl. bifermentans c21 and cl. sporogenes c25. inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.

TI  == cefotaxime lavage in children undergoing appendicectomy.
AB  == in an attempt to reduce postoperative sepsis, a series of randomised, double-blind studies was begun in 1982, using cefotaxime as backbone therapy. up  to 1985 (stages i and ii), the best results were obtained using a combination of  cefotaxime (75 mg/kg intravenously in 3 doses at 12-hourly intervals) plus metronidazole (10 mg/kg intravenously in 3 doses), both drugs administered 1 hour before surgery (preoperatively) or at anaesthetic induction (peroperatively). in  300 consecutive cases, the wound infection rates were 1% in uncomplicated acute appendicitis and 5% in perforated/gangrenous appendices. the present study (stage iii) reports the findings in 401 consecutive patients: 215 treated with the above regimen, either pre- or perioperatively (group 1) and 186 who additionally had peritoneal lavage with cefotaxime 2 g/l during surgery (group 2). there were 16 wound infections overall, 2 among patients administered prophylaxis preoperatively and 14 in those administered prophylaxis perioperatively. all produced mixed cultures, with escherichia coli, streptococcus milleri and bacteroides fragilis predominating. the overall figures for postoperative sepsis  are 12/215 (5.6%) in the non-lavage group and 8/186 (4.3%) in the lavage group. among patients with a perforated and/or gangrenous appendix, the wound infection  rate was 8/72 (11.1%) in the non-lavage group (group 1) and 4/66 (6.1%) in the lavage group (group 2). each group had 2 cases of pelvic abscess.

TI  == chemical and biological properties of acetyl derivatives of the hydroxylamino reduction products of metronidazole and dimetridazole.
AB  == metronidazole and related 5-nitroimidazoles undergo reduction of their nitro group apparently to produce such reactive species as 5-hydroxylaminoimidazoles. to define the role of these species we have sought ways to prepare them by the catalytic reduction of metronidazole, dimetridazole and flunidazole. although their respective 5-hydroxylaminoimidazoles were too unstable to be isolated directly, their o,n-diacetyl derivatives were isolable. of these, the diacetyl derivative of the hydroxylamine derived from dimetridazole, o,n-diacetyl-1,2-dimethyl-5-hydroxylaminoimidazole (diacdmh), was used for further study. diacdmh was converted to its monoacetyl derivative, n-acetyl-1,2-dimethyl-5-hydroxylaminoimidazole (acdmh), by enzymatic deacylation. both diacdmh and acdmh were examined for bactericidal activity against such strains as bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and escherichia coli strain sr58, which are known to be sensitive to dimetridazole, as well as a variety of other bacteria. no bactericidal activity was detected, even in the presence of deacetylating enzymes. as the 5-hydroxylaminoimidazole itself could not be shown to form in these bacterial incubations, it remains uncertain whether or not the hydroxylamino functionality of a 5-nitroimidazole has bactericidal activity.

TI  == inactivation of cefoxitin and moxalactam by bacteroides bivius beta-lactamase.
AB  == moxalactam and cefoxitin are known for their high stability against bacteroides beta-lactamases. we investigated the beta-lactamase activity of crude extracts obtained from three strains of bacteroides bivius and two strains of bacteroides  fragilis against cefoxitin and moxalactam. in a spectrophotometric antibiotic assay with a 24-h incubation period, b. bivius extracts decreased the initial concentration (10 micrograms/ml) of moxalactam and cefoxitin by 60%, whereas b. fragilis extracts had no effect. in a microbiological assay, when b. bivius or b. fragilis extracts were added to cephalothin (10 micrograms/ml) or cefamandole (4  micrograms/ml), we observed complete disappearance of the inhibitory zones against the indicator strain (clostridium perfringens atcc 13124). only the b. bivius extracts were able to decrease the inhibitory activity (from 10 to 100%) of cefoxitin and moxalactam (each at 10 micrograms/ml). prior addition of clavulanic acid to crude extracts prevented the losses of antibacterial activity. furthermore, the inhibition of the beta-lactamase hydrolysis of nitrocefin by cefoxitin or moxalactam was prevented by a 12-h preincubation of the beta-lactam  with the b. bivius extracts but not with the b. fragilis extracts. finally, with  the b. bivius strain producing the most beta-lactamase, we showed an effect of inoculum size on the mics of cefoperazone, cefoxitin, and moxalactam with a broth dilution technique. increasing the inoculum size with the b. fragilis strains had no effect on the miss of cefoxitin and moxalactam. these results indicate a slow  and clavulanate-sensitive beta-lactamase activity of b. bivius extracts against cefoxitin and moxalactam.

AB  == a reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. a 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. the intestine was then divided at  each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. the segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. this experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. within three days 40% of the animals  receiving pefloxacin died. animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or  gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. only 5% of these animals died. thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == changes in the cell wall of clostridium species following passage in animals.
AB  == morphological changes in clostridial isolates after animal passage with other flora in mixed infections were studied by utilizing a subcutaneous abscess model  in mice. we used 26 isolates of 7 clostridial species, and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. abscesses were induced by all 7 clostridium perfringens and 3 clostridium butyricum isolates and by some of the other isolates. a thick granular wall prior to animal inoculation was shown only  in c. perfringens, c. butyricum, and c. difficile. this structure was observed in other clostridia only following their animal passage alone or when co-inoculated  with k. pneumoniae or b. fragilis.

AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of three antimicrobial agents were determined by two fold dilution in wilkins chalgren agar for over 569 anaerobes isolated and collected from 20 french hospitals. metronidazole, cefoxitin and clindamycin inhibited respectively 95, 97 and 91% of tested strains. no metronidazole resistant strains could be found among bacteroides fragilis group,  fusobacterium and clostridium other than c. perfringens. cefoxitin was the most active against c. perfringens, gram positive cocci and non sporulated bacilli. clindamycin resistance was observed mainly with b. fragilis and clostridium other than c perfringens. this phenomenon occurred in most hospitals where strains were isolated.

TI  == evolution and epidemiology of mls resistance.
AB  == within the framework of this symposium, it is not feasible to present an exhaustive description of the present state of knowledge regarding the sensitivity and resistance of bacterial species to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (mls). this paper is limited to a description of the evolution of  different types of resistance in the light of decisive factors described in previous papers, in order to deduce, if at all possible, trends in future strategy in therapeutics. only acquired resistance lends itself to epidemiological study, in contrast to natural resistance which is, by definition, characteristic of a species or a genus, and not liable to change. three groups will therefore be studied in turn: staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and bacteroides fragilis. there is as yet insufficient accumulated data to draw conclusions regarding the epidemiology and evolution of mlsb resistance observed  in clostridium perfringens and corynebacterium diphtheriae, or regarding the high-level resistance to erythromycin due to enzymatic inactivation recently described in escherichia coli.

TI  == in vitro activity of imipenem against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, moxalactam, and cefoxitin against 203 strains of anaerobic bacteria isolated from patients at the veterans administration wadsworth medical center in los angeles was studied. imipenem and metronidazole were the most active agents overall, inhibiting 98% and 99%, respectively, of all anaerobes tested. at breakpoint levels all of the agents tested were very active against anaerobic cocci. clostridium perfringens,  and bacteroides species other than those of the bacteroides fragilis group. imipenem, metronidazole, and clindamycin were the most active agents against the  b. fragilis group in this study, although more recent experience with clindamycin indicates less potency. marked variation among the susceptibility results obtained at various centers may be due to differences in technique, including inoculum size, media, and incubation time. in all instances, however, imipenem has clearly been the most active of the beta-lactam agents.

(mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. anaerobes can be  isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. the genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) offteroides, clostridium, gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, actinomyces, and bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (veillonella and acidaminococcus). clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.

AB  == the in vitro activities of two new antimicrobial agents, apalcillin and cefpiramide (sm-1652), were evaluated against 324 strains of anaerobic bacteria.  apalcillin (a penicillin derivative) and cefpiramide (a semisynthetic cephalosporin) were compared with piperacillin, moxalactam, and cefoxitin. organisms studied included the bacteroides fragilis group, other bacteroides species, fusobacteria, clostridia, nonsporeforming gram-positive rods, and anaerobic cocci. piperacillin was found to be the most active overall, inhibiting 96% of the strains tested at its achievable level in serum (128 micrograms/ml). apalcillin was comparable in activity to piperacillin, inhibiting 93% of anaerobes tested at this concentration. the other antibiotics inhibited ca. 80% of the strains at 32 micrograms/ml. in terms of activities against particular species, apalcillin was active against 75% of b. fragilis group strains and 97 to 100% of all other anaerobes. cefpiramide inhibited 37% of b. fragilis group strains at 32 micrograms/ml and 68% at 64 micrograms/ml (a level that may be achievable with this drug). cefpiramide inhibited 92% of all other anaerobes at 32 micrograms/ml and 95% at 64 micrograms/ml. the clostridia other than clostridium perfringens were the most resistant (84% inhibited at 32 micrograms/ml and 95% inhibited at 64 micrograms/ml).

TI  == anaerobic bacteria and beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == this review is concerned with anaerobic bacteria and beta-lactam antibiotics. data on the susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics of anaerobic isolates in sweden during 1983 is presented. among the different bacterial groups, clostridium perfringens, anaerobic cocci and curved rods were found to be very susceptible to the beta-lactams tested. c. difficile was susceptible to benzylpenicillin, piperacillin and imipenem, but resistant to the second and third generation of cephalosporins. most fusobacteria were susceptible to the beta-lactam antibiotics investigated. however, some strains were found to be resistant to the penicillins. against the bacteroides fragilis group, imipenem had the best activity whereas moxalactam, piperacillin and cefoxitin had good activities. the majority of the bacteroides non-fragilis strains were still susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. however, an increasing number of isolates were found to be resistant, especially to the penicillins when comparing with data from the last five years. the known mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in  anaerobic bacteria involve production of beta-lactamases, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins and blocked penetration of beta-lactams through the outer membranes of anaerobes. the presence of beta-lactamases in various bacteroides and clostridium species is reported as well as the characteristics of the different beta-lactamases encountered. the role of penicillin-binding proteins and penetration barrier in beta-lactam resistance is also discussed.

TI  == comparison of three methods for anaerobe identification.
AB  == in this study we evaluated the ability of three commercial methods, api 20a (analytab products, plainview, n.y.), minitek (bbl microbiology systems, cockeysville, md.), and anaerobe-tek (flow laboratories, inc., mclean, va.), to accurately identify 165 recent clinical and 38 stock isolates of anaerobic bacteria without supplemental tests or gas-liquid chromatography. strains included 89 bacteroides spp., 12 fusobacteria, 10 gram-positive, nonsporing rods, 43 clostridium spp., 15 streptococcus intermedius, 18 peptococci, 6 peptostreptococci, 3 staphylococcus saccharolyticus, and 7 veillonella spp. the methods used were those of manufacturers, without supplemental tests. api 20a correctly identified 70.0% of strains to species and 6.4% to genus only, with 17.2% as part of a spectrum of identifications and 6.4% incorrect. minitek, according to the current code book, yielded 69.5% correct identifications to species, 16.8% spectrum identifications, and 13.8% incorrect. anaerobe-tek correctly identified 64.0% of strains to species, 21.2% spectrum identifications, and 14.8% incorrect. thirteen strains were misidentified by api 20a, 28 were misidentified by minitek, and 30 were misidentified by anaerobe-tek. for laboratories without gas-liquid chromatography support and where identification of clinically significant bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens is desired, any of the three systems would provide accurate information. for more extensive anaerobe identification, including the less frequently isolated, more unusual organisms, api 20a and minitek are preferred at this time. all systems have identification schemes associated with a percentage of misidentifications, the most recently introduced anaerobe-tek system being associated with the highest error rate.

TI  == the identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria from pneumonic cattle lungs.
AB  == one hundred and forty-four lungs obtained postmortem from cattle with pneumonia were cultured for anaerobic bacteria. forty-five lungs yielded 73 anaerobic isolates belonging to 20 species. the number of isolations of anaerobes from acute fibrinous or suppurative bronchopneumonias (32.5%) was slightly lower than  from similar chronic bronchopneumonias (36.5%). anaerobes were not recovered from 15 lungs showing macroscopic changes not of bacterial origin, nor from 13 healthy lungs. the predominant genera isolated were bacteroides, peptococcus, fusobacterium and clostridium. the most common species were p. indolicus (15 isolates), b. asaccharolyticus (nine), f. necrophorum (six), c. perfringens (four) and b. fragilis (four). there was a significant correlation between the presence of corynebacterium pyogenes (p less than 0.001) or escherichia coli (p less than 0.01) and the presence of anaerobes in the lungs. the isolated anaerobic bacteria were generally susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin g, cefoxitin, cephalothin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline  and metronidazole. the b. fragilis and c. perfringens isolates showed multiple antibiotic resistance, and five p. indolicus isolates were resistant to tetracycline.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria as cause of infections in female genital organs.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria constitute a substantial component of the normal vaginal flora and of the outer cervical canal. consequently, one would expect infections emanating from the vaginal flora to be caused to a substantial degree by anaerobic bacteria. the anaerobes may contribute in colpitis, but their role is difficult to prove in this situation, since sampling only yields normal flora components. one clue that anaerobes may contribute to colpitis is the circumstance that the flora under those conditions differ from the normal situations. another is the circumstance that metronidazole, which only inhibits anaerobes, does reduce symptoms e.g. of colpitis in the presence of the microaerophilic gardnerella vaginalis, which is resistant to metronidazole (but sensitive to the metabolite hydroxymetronidazole). in the us, pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is to a substantial degree apparently caused by anaerobic bacteria. our experience in scandinavia indicates that anaerobes are of neglible importance in this condition, since we rarely isolate anaerobes in spite of adequate sampling, transport and processing of specimens. we mostly find anaerobes in post-operative pid when the vaginal wall has been passed, or as a complication of pregnancy (puerperal fever, early rupture of membranes, abortion), and in connection with intrauterine devices. the role of anaerobes in bartholinitis is established. pid may be associated with appendicitis or colonic diverticulosis. anaerobes are regularly isolated from abscesses developing in the pelvic organs.  this also applies to tuboovarial and vulvovaginal abscesses. the most important anaerobic bacteria in infections of the female genital organs are bacteroides fragilis and other species of the fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus and related  species, other bacteroides, peptococci and peptostreptococci. clostridium perfringens rarely cause infections of female genital organs, although such conditions have a dramatic course.

TI  == recent experience with antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria: increasing resistance to penicillin.
AB  == results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobes were reviewed for the last 5 years and compared with two previous surveys from this institution. allowing for differences in methodology, there appears to be a striking increase  in penicillin resistance by the "non-fragilis" bacteroides. penicillin concentrations of 50 microgram/ml were required to inhibit 70% of 43 strains tested. the clinical implications of this observation are not known, but isolated reports of therapeutic failure when penicillin was used against the non-fragilis  bacteroides have appeared. penicillin resistance among clostridium other than c.  perfringens was also noted in the current study. several strains of clindamycin-resistant bacteroides fragilis have been observed during the last 2 years, and whether this represents a true increase in resistance will require close scrutiny of clindamycin susceptibility in the future. future surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria will be useful in the detection of any major changes in susceptibility profiles. this knowledge will potentially affect the choice of antimicrobial agent in patients with serious infections caused by anaerobes.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

TI  == pediatric surgical patients with severe anaerobic infection: report of 16 t-antigen positive cases and possible hazards of blood transfusion.
AB  == red blood cells become polyagglutinable when the normally latent t-antigens of the red blood cell membrane are exposed. unmasking of t-antigens results from removal of n-acetyl-neuraminic acid by neuraminidase, an enzyme commonly produced by a variety of bacteria. red blood cells altered in this way are said to be t-activated. t-activated red blood cells can be agglutinated by anti-t, an antibody normally present in human serum, so that severe transfusion reactions may occur and have occurred, if t-antigen positive patients are transfused with normal whole blood or plasma. this can be avoided by transfusing only packed or washed red blood cells. from october 1978 to october 1980 we found t-activation in 16 pediatric surgical patients aged 3 days to 14 yr with severe anaerobic infections. this included patients with necrotizing enterocolitis, perforated appendicitis, megacolon, infected anal atresia and gas gangrene. the isolate neuraminidase-producing bacteria were clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis. clinical data of these 16 patients are briefly reviewed and the importance of t-antigen positivity for their management is discussed.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of new beta-lactam antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == several new beta-lactam antimicrobial agents have been introduced in the last few years. in this investigation, the in vitro activities of several recently introduced cephalosporins (cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftizoxime), moxalactam, and n-formimidoyl thienamycin were compared with those  of cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against 203 strains of anaerobic bacteria. at achievable serum levels, all of the antimicrobial agents were active against essentially 100% of the strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci, clostridium perfringens, leptotrichia buccalis, and species of selenomonas, veillonella, and eubacterium. clindamycin, metronidazole, and n-formimidoyl thienamycin were the most active agents against the bacteroides fragilis group, inhibiting all strains at concentrations which can be achieved in serum. of the remaining agents tested against the b. fragilis group, cefoxitin (which required  64 mug/ml to inhibit 90% of the strains) was the most active, followed by cefoperazone (128 mug/ml), cefotaxime (128 mug/ml), moxalactam (128 mug/ml), ceftizoxime (256 mug/ml), and ceftazidime (>256 mug/ml). important differences in cephalosporin susceptibility among species of the b. fragilis group were observed. metronidazole and n-formimidoyl thienamycin were the most active drugs  against species of clostridia other than c. perfringens; the other antibiotics displayed poor activity, although this is partly due to inclusion of a relatively large number of strains of clostridium difficile which were very resistant to several of the cephalosporins. only metronidazole was active against all species  of fusobacterium. clindamycin and n-formimidoyl thienamycin displayed excellent activity against gram-positive, non-spore-forming bacilli, requiring </=8 mug/ml  to inhibit 100% of the strains. ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and moxalactam were bactericidal for 25 strains of b. fragilis at concentrations equal or close to those required for inhibition. on the basis of its activity in vitro, n-formimidoyl thienamycin appears to be the most promising of the new beta-lactam antibiotics for the treatment of infections involving anaerobic bacteria.

AB  == metronidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole that has selective activity against anaerobic microorganisms, including bacteria and protozoa. intravenous metronidazole has recently been approved by the u.s. food and drug administration for the treatment of serious anaerobic bacterial infections. it is usually bactericidal at low concentrations, and its spectrum of activity encompasses almost all anaerobic bacteria and some capnophilic organisms. anaerobic bacteria known to be resistant to metronidazole include occasional anaerobic cocci, some nonsporulating gram-positive bacilli and propionibacterium. metronidazole is the most active antimicrobial agent against bacteroides fragilis, the most resistant of anaerobic bacteria. kill-curve studies demonstrate that there is a 2 to 5 log decrease in the number of colony forming units of b. fragilis and clostridium perfringens within one hour. the only well documented metronidazole-resistant strain is a b.  fragilis isolated from the normal flora of a patient on long-term metronidazole therapy for crohn's disease. metronidazole resistance in trichomonas vaginalis has recently been described in a few strains that are able to survive at increased oxygen tensions. metronidazole has been shown to be efficacious in certain protozoal infections including trichomonal vaginitis, extraintestinal amebiasis, and giardiasis. clinical studies have shown metronidazole to be efficacious in the therapy of a variety of anaerobic infections, including non-traumatic brain abscesses, intraabdominal sepsis, pelvic suppuration and necrotizing soft tissue infections. there have been disappointing results in the  therapy of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections with a number of superinfections  caused by aerobic bacteria. since metronidazole lacks any activity against aerobic bacteria, it must be combined with other agents, usually aminoglycosides, in the treatment of mixed infections involving anaerobic and aerobic bacteria.

TI  == [anaerobic bacteria in clinical specimens of a hospital laboratory (author's transl)].
AB  == over a 14-month period 261 clinical specimens were cultured anaerobically, this figure representing about 3% of the total specimens submitted to the microbiological laboratory. not accepted for anaerobic culture were stools, sputa, urines, vaginal and urethral swabs and swabs from superficial skin lesions. all materials were sent to the laboratory in an anaerobic transport medium and processed according to the recommendations of the american society for microbiology and the center for disease control, atlanta, georgia. not included in this figure are blood cultures and cultures from removed venous catheters. 35% of the specimens contained anaerobes. 169 anaerobic strains were isolated. 78 of  them belonged to the bacteroides fragilis group. clostridium perfringens was found in only 7 cases. 14% of the strains were b. melaninogenicus, 7% other gram-negative non-sporeforming rods. in most of the cases a mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora was found. more than 75% of specimens obtained from infections originating from the lower intestinal tract yielded growth of anaerobes. in infections of the bile duct anaerobes were found in 25% of the cases. in infections of the upper urinary tract anaerobes played no major role. 35% of the isolates of the b. fragilis group were resistant to tetracycline, 17%  to cefoxitin and 9% to clindamycin.

TI  == nitroimidazoles: in vitro activity and efficacy in anaerobic infections.
AB  == nitroimidazoles, including metronidazole, tinidazole and ornidazole, are low molecular weight antimicrobial compounds with excellent activity against anaerobic microorganisms. these compounds are usually bactericidal at low concentrations and their spectrum of activity encompasses almost all the anaerobic bacteria and some capnophylic organisms. the few anaerobic bacteria known to be resistant to the nitroimidazoles include occasional anaerobic cocci,  some nonsporing gram positive bacilli and propionibacterium. nitroimidazoles are  the most active antimicrobial agents known against bacteroides fragilis, the most resistant of anaerobic bacteria. kill-curve studies demonstrate that there is a 2 to 5 log decrease in the number of colony forming units with bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens within one hour. the killing is unaffected by inoculum, growth rate or components of the medium. however, a metronidazole resistant isolate of b. fragilis has been shown to have decreased ability to take up 14c-metronidazole as well as lessened ability to reduce metronidazole. this is associated with a decrease in the nitroreductase activity. the in vitro observations have also been demonstrated in vivo. clinical studies have shown nitroimidazoles to be efficacious in the therapy of a variety of anaerobic infections including non-traumatic brain abscess, intraabdominal abscesses, pelvic suppuration and necrotizing soft tissue infections. however, there have been disappointing results in the therapy of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections, with a number of superinfections caused by aerobic bacteria.

TI  == deconjugation of bile salts by bacteroids and clostridium.
AB  == deconjugation of bile salts by four strains of bacteroides and four strains of clostridium was studied by use of resting cells and cell-free culture supernatants. bacteroids strains yielded active cells but showed relatively low bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activity in the culture supernatants while the reverse  was the case for the spore-forming clostridial strains. bsh was formed constitutively and was oxygen insensitive. the optimum ph was between 4.5 and 5.0. marked substrate specificity was found in two strains, one clostridium and one bacteroides, which showed restricted activity against taurine conjugates. bacteroides in general attacked the taurine conjugates of dihydroxy bile acids more readily than the trihydroxy taurine conjugates. deconjugated bile acid moieties were further modified by some resting cells, depending on the bacterial  strain while no enzymatic activity other than that of bsh was found in the culture supernatants. cells of b. fragilis 2536 performed 7 alpha-dehydrogenation when the ph of the medium allowed the reaction, and this oxidative process was markedly enhanced in the presence of an abundant supply of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. c. perfringens pb 6k produced the 3- keto product in addition  to the 3 beta-hydroxy derivative of the liberated bile acids and the formation of the latter derivative seemed to take place without preliminary deconjugation.

TI  == susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to nine antimicrobial agents and demonstration of decreased susceptibility of clostridium perfringens to penicillin.
AB  == the activity of moxalactam, cefoxitin, cephalothin, cefamandole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, metronidazole, and ticarcillin was determined against 344 isolates of anaerobic bacteria. the activity of penicillin g was determined as well for 234 isolates not of the bacteroides fragilis group. moxalactam was more active than cephalothin and cefamandole and slightly less active than cefoxitin. metronidazole was the most active antimicrobial agent against the b. fragilis group, whereas chloramphenicol was most active overall. clostridium species were  the most resistant group of organisms tested. relatively high concentrations of penicillin were required to inhibit the c. perfringens strains: 80% at 0.5 u/ml and 100% at 16 u/ml. our study demonstrates the need for periodic anaerobe susceptibility testing in order to better guide empiric antibiotic therapy.

TI  == relationship between metronidazole metabolism and bactericidal activity.
AB  == it has been suggested that the microbicidal effect of metronidazole is mediated by an intermediate in nitro group reduction. we have found that the addition of escherichia coli enhances the lethal effect of metronidazole on bacillus fragilis and suggest that this intermediate may form in one bacteria and kill another. because acetamide forms during the reduction of metronidazole, we examined the possibility that the same partially reduced intermediate in metronidazole reduction may be both an intermediate in the formation of acetamide and the ultimate reactive form of metronidazole which is responsible for its bactericidal action. thus, we determined the relationship between bacterial survival and the formation of acetamide when cultures of b. fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and e. coli were incubated anaerobically in the presence of metronidazole. we found that the log of the early bacterial survival was proportional to the formation of acetamide. the rate of loss of metronidazole was not dependent on the concentration of bacteria in the medium, suggesting that any proposed intermediate formed at a rate which was proportional only to the concentration of metronidazole.

AB  == the effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, c. paraputrificum, c. perfringens, c. innocuum, c. nexile, c. ramosum, c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides multiacidus, bacteroides fragilis, veillonella alcalescens, v. parvula, and lactobacillus acidophilus. the incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, and c. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). in contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, c. perfringens, and bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from  that in germfree animals (0.5). the present study demonstrated that the presence  of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == collaborative evaluation of a proposed reference dilution method of susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == an agar dilution method for susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria was evaluated to determine whether results obtained would be consistent enough to recommend it as a reference method. the study was conducted in 10 laboratories where the minimum inhibitory concentrations of six antibiotics (carbenicillin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, penicillin g, and tetracycline) were determined against 10 bacterial strains on wilkins-chalgren agar prepared by three manufacturers. minimum inhibitory concentrations falling on the modes varied from 57 to 80% of all determinations and on the mode or within +/-1 log(2) dilution of the mode from 87 to 100% within each laboratory. when data from all laboratories were pooled, minimum inhibitory concentrations from each laboratory  agreed with the overall mode 48 to 71% of the time, with an overall agreement at  +/-1 log(2) dilution of 96%. this degree of reproducibility allows for recommendation of the procedure as a reference method. results with three of the  test strains were very consistent, and these strains are recommended as control strains: clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285 and  bacteroides thetaiotaomicron atcc 29741. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for these strains were on the mode or within +/-1 log(2) dilution of the mode 98, 99, and 99% of the time, respectively. the remaining anaerobic bacteria are recommended as reference strains.

TI  == experimental animal models for anaerobic infections.
AB  == an experimental animal model that stimulates the mixed aerobic-anaerobic microflora of intraabdominal sepsis was used to study antimicrobial efficacy in vivo. treatment of infected rats with chloramphenicol resulted in only a modest reduction in the percentage of animals surviving infection with abscesses at necropsy. this unanticipated observation led to further exploration of the predominant anaerobes associated with the experimental infection. in vitro cultures of bacteroides fragilis, susceptible to chloramphenicol in traditional tests, were capable of reducing chloramphenicol to its aryl amine derivative, which is biologically inactive. in contrast, metronidazole, an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, reduced the coli-metronidazole, an antimicrobial  agent active against anaerobes, reduced the coli-form-associated mortality in this animal model. subsequent studies showed that this reduction in mortality is  dependent on the presence of an anaerobe and that the levels of escherichia coli  in mixed continuous culture with b. fragilis are reduced by addition of metronidazole. this reduction following addition of metronidazole was not observed either in a pure culture of e. coli or when clindamycin was added to a mixed culture. in a modification of the previously described model, infective material was placed subcutaneously into wistar rats. studies with this model suggested that the host's response to bacterial challenge is dependent on the site of infection and that organotropism of the implanted bacterial species is an important determinant of infection.

TI  == acute appendicitis and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. ovatus, b.  vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. uniformis) were cultured in quantities of less than or equal to 10(5) c.f.u./ml from the excised appendix from 30 patients. twenty-two patients (group i) had an acute purulent appendicitis (three with perforation), four were classified as slightly inflamed  cases (group 2) and four had a normal appendix (group 3). the b. fragilis group of bacteria dominated among the anaerobic isolates, but bifidobacteria, fusobacteri, clostridium perfringens, lactobacilli, leptotrichia and veillonella, in decreasing order, were isolated as well. among isolates of aerobic bacteria, e. coli was most frequently isolated (26/30 patients). no other genus was isolated from more than four of the appendices. serological investigations of the humoral antibody response to polysaccharide antigens from four of the bacteroides species showed that a doubling of the titer, or more, in paired serum samples could be observed as follows: against b. fragilis 6/22 patients (group 1), 3/8 patients (groups 2 and 3). the corresponding figures for b. ovatus were 11/22 and 2/8, b. vulgatus 3/22 and 0/8 and b. distasonis 4/22 and 0/8. sera from two patients with ruptured appendix, and b. fragilis cultivated, showed the highest titer increases against the b. fragilis antigen. the data from the bacteriological and immunological investigations make us conclude that (i) the b. fragilis group of bacteria is the most common anaerobic group of bacteria isolated from normal and diseased appendices, (ii) the mere isolation of b. fragilis, encapsulated or not, does not imply an etiological role in appendicitis since there was no obvious difference in titer increases against b. fragilis in sera from patients with or without an inflamed appendix, and (iii) high, and significant, titer increases against b. fragilis are seen in sera from patients with ruptured appendix.

TI  == mechanism of aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance in anaerobic bacteria: clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == cell-free amino acid incorporation using ribosomes from strains of either clostridium perfringens or bacteroides fragilis was shown to be susceptible to inhibition by streptomycin and gentamicin. ribosomes bound dihydrostreptomycin as effectively as ribosomes from escherichia coli. no inactivation of streptomycin or gentamicin was detected by cell extracts of either anaerobic bacterial species. b. fragilis, grown without added hemin, menadione, and fumarate, and c.  perfringens did not show any time-dependent accumulation of dihydrostreptomycin or gentamicin at concentrations tested. decreased resistance to aminoglycosides and time-dependent uptake of dihydrostreptomycin at 500 mug/ml was observed with  b. fragilis grown with hemin, menadione, and fumarate. with the last additions, cytochrome b was detected by cytochrome spectra of b. fragilis. these results demonstrate that anaerobic bacteria unable to carry out oxygen- or nitrate-dependent electron transport are resistant to streptomycin and gentamicin because of failure to transport aminoglycosides. the induction of fumarate-dependent electron transport in b. fragilis is associated with some aminoglycoside transport that is of poor efficiency relative to bacteria with electron transport to oxygen or nitrate.

AB  == all the 28 bacteroides fragilis strains investigated were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole (minimal inhibitory concentration < 16 mug/ml) and resistant to  trimethoprim (tmp; minimal inhibitory concentration > 4 mug/ml). synergism between sulfamethoxazole and tmp was present in all strains at a ratio of 1:1. the few clostridia investigated proved more resistant to both compounds. dihydrofolate reductases from b. fragilis, c. perfringens, and some other anaerobic species were isolated. inhibition profiles with six structurally different inhibitors revealed major differences in all enzymes. for 50% inhibition, the enzyme from b. fragilis and all clostridia required concentrations of tmp which were between several hundredfold and 1,000-fold higher than those required for the enzyme of escherichia coli, whereas the enzyme from propionibacterium acnes only needed a threefold higher concentration. in vitro activities of tmp were seen to correspond to the activity at the enzymatic  level in b. fragilis and p. acnes, but correspond to a much lesser extent to the  activity at the enzymatic level in clostridia, where a poor penetration is assumed to be involved. dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors other than tmp were found to be as active as tmp both at the enzyme and in vitro. in b. fragilis, higher concentrations of exogenous thymidine were required for increasing the minimal inhibitory concentration of tmp than in e. coli and probably also in c. perfringens.

TI  == pathogenesis of mucosal injury in the blind loop syndrome.
AB  == bacterial extracts were prepared from cultures originating in chronic self-filling intestinal blind loops in rats. their ability to remove active maltase molecules from isolated brush border membranes was studied in vitro. twelve strains in 51 tested, belonging to one of three species, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and streptococcus fecalis, possessed maltase-releasing activity. the ability to remove maltase correlated well with the ability to hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-l-alaninate (nba), an ester substrate rapidly hydrolyzed by elastase, but not with substrated favored by tryhsin and chymotrypsin. maltase-releasing activity from c. perfringens was strongly inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor and to a lesser extent by lima bean trypsin inhibitor. of four chloromethylketone active-site directed inhibitors tested with specificities for elastase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, inhibition was maximal with elastase-specific inhibitors. in two species, activity was shown to be heat sensitive, and to be inhibited by concentration of the extract. in one species maltase-releasing activity was shown to be due to an enzyme of molecular weight at least 66,000 with the capacity to remove lactase, sucrase, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as maltase. the results indicate that anaerobic or facultatively anaerobic species, previously identified with the pathology of of the blind loop syndrome, contain proteases which are capable of removing components of the intestinal surface membrane. these proteases appear to have elastase-like substrate specificity and may be involved in the etiology of disaccharidase deficiency in bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

TI  == in vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  == the susceptibility of more than 40 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. the influences of density of the inoculum upon mics was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. bacteroides fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. splanchnicus, b. oralis, b. asaccharolyticus, b. melaninogenicus, fusobacterium fusiforme (f. nucleatum), sphaerophorus necrophorus, clostridium perfringens, c.  fallax, propionibacterium acnes and several species of peptococcaceae showed broth dilution mics of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. members of b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of s. varius had a broth dilution mic  of 256 microgram/ml. with most strains, the agar dilution mics were 2 similar to  4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution mics. in pour plate-tests, the mics were  not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. with most anaerobes, the mbcs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the mics. the results obtained indicated that, apart from s. varius,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including b. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of metronidazole in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of metronidazole was investigated in anaerobic bacteria by use of time-viability studies. this antimicrobial agent has a rapid onset of bactericidal activity under proper reducing conditions. the bactericidal rates were not affected by inoculum size or nutritional requirements, nor by inhibition of growth and protein synthesis by chloramphenicol. using supernatant  fractions of actively growing cultures of susceptible organisms, we observed a disappearance of metronidazole and a loss of biological activity, but there was no significant change in preparations from resistant bacteria. the decrease in drug concentration with susceptible cells occurred during the time that its bactericidal action was being exerted. extracts from susceptible organisms rapidly reduced the concentration of metronidazole, confirming previous observations which suggest that the drug acts as a terminal electron acceptor. radioisotope experiments with [14c]metronidazole revealed that the compound was taken up by both resistant and susceptible bacteria, although there was a difference in rate and extent of accumulation. these studies demonstrate that metronidazole's antimicrobial activity against anaerobic bacteria is bactericidal and independent of growth rate, and that it involves the uptake and metabolism of the compound.

TI  == activity of spectinomycin against anaerobes.
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of spectinomycin was tested against various anaerobic bacteria. different results were obtained with different media and with different initial ph's of the media. the highest minimum inhibitory concentrations for bacteroides fragilis ([formula: see text] 128 mug/ml) were obtained with the use of wilkins-chalgren agar (ph 7.2) and brucella blood agar (ph 7.0). brucella blood agar at higher ph's (7.4 and 8.0) and mueller-hinton and diagnostic sensitivity test agars produced lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (32 and 64 mug/ml). this same relationship between spectinomycin activity and ph of the medium was, in general, observed with these media and other anaerobes, including isolates of b. melaninogenicus, fusobacterium, gram-positive cocci, clostridium perfringens, and c. ramosum. the variable results observed in this study and in two others make it difficult to predict the clinical usefulness of spectinomycin in the treatment of anaerobic infections. it is probably most appropriate to be guided by results obtained with wilkins-chalgren agar and the method proposed as a reference to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. these results indicate that spectinomycin is not a potent inhibitor of b. fragilis or other clinically significant anaerobes.

AB  == gallbladder bile from 52 elderly subjects who had undergone biliary tract surgery was examined for the presence of bacteria. twelve patients had sterile bile, 18 specimens of bile yielded anaerobes as well as aerobes, and 22 yielded aerobic bacteria only. escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated organism (30 strains). bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently encountered anaerobic bacterium and was found in 15 patients. the klebsiella-enterobacter group was the second most commonly isolated group and b. fragilis was third. clostridium perfringens was recovered in 10 specimens of bile. anaerobic bacteria were recovered more frequently in patients with ductal obstruction. the relatively frequent isolation of anaerobes, especially of b. fragilis, in this study may be  related to the anaerobic techniques used, to the age of the patients, and to the  high incidence of pigment stones among the subjects.

AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

AB  == susceptibility of 358 clinical isolates of obligate anaerobes to metronidazole was determined by an agar-dilution technique. only 66% of all isolates were inhibited by 6.25 mug/ml, whereas 30% required larger than or equal to 50 mug/ml. considerable variation in susceptibility was observed among different genera and  species of bacteria. fusobacterium was most senstitive, followed by clostridium,  bacteroides and peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and acidaminococcus, and non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli. bacteroides fragilis was more sensitive than other species of bacteroides. similarly, clostridium perfringens was more susceptible than other species of clostriduim. while metronidazole appears to be a promising antimicrobial agent for infections caused by fusobacterium, clostrididium, and b.fragilis, therapy for infections with other anaerobic bacteria should be guided by in vitro tests of sensitiivity.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria by the standardized disc  diffusion method with special reference to bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the susceptibility of 90 strains of bacteroides fragilis to 16 antibacterial drugs was determined by the agar plate dilution test and the disc diffusion test. good correlation of results was obtained with the two methods, and regression line analysis could be performed for beta-lactam antibiotics, erythromycin, tetracyclines, lincomycin and clindamycin. thus the standardized disc diffusion method can be used for susceptibility testing, but only a clear distinction between sensitive and resistant strains can be seen.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria: recent clinical isolates.
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations of clindamycin, minocycline, metronidazole, penicillin, and carbenicillin were determined by agar dilution against 150 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. ninety-nine percent of bacteroides fragilis and all b. melaninogenicus, clostridium perfringens, and fusobacterium were inhibited by clindamycin at 3.1 mug/ml. only 58% of other clostridial species were inhibited by this concentration of clindamycin. minocycline at 3.1 mug/ml inhibited 72% of c. perfringens, 81% of other clostridium species, and 66, 75, and 100% of b. fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, and fusobacterium, respectively. metronidazole at 12.5 mug/ml inhibited all bacteria tested. b. fragilis was resistant to both penicillin and carbenicillin at 6.2 mug/ml. concentrations of 25 mug/ml for penicillin and 100 mug/ml for carbenicillin were needed to inhibit  more than 90% of b. fragilis. organisms other than b. fragilis were moderately or extremely susceptible to the penicillins.

TI  == extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the production of extracellular deoxyribonuclease was examined with anaerobic organisms isolated from clinical specimens. nuclease activity was extraordinarily common. all strains of fusobacterium, including eight species, as well as bacteroides fragilis and b. melaninogenicus, displayed enzyme activity. whereas the gram-positive bacteria were generally less productive, all strains of clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus intermedius, and p. anaerobius specifically produced deoxyribonuclease. the test is taxonomically valuable, particularly in the characterization of gram-positive cocci, since a deoxyribonuclease-producing coccus indicates p. intermedius or p. anaerobius. additionally, possession of the enzyme may prove to be a useful correlate of the  potential pathogenicity of anaerobes.

TI  == phosphatase activity of anaerobic organisms.
AB  == anaerobic organisms were tested for phosphatase activity in different ph ranges.  several groups of organisms displayed characteristic patterns. bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, and b. ruminicola produced phosphatase with strongest activity at ph 8.6. fusobacterium mortiferum was the only species of this genus to show strong hydrolysis. the enzyme was active in both acid and alkaline ranges. the activity of gram-positive organisms was variable, the most active groups being clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus intermedius, p. micros, and peptococcus constellatus. the incorporation of phosphatase activity into the identification scheme of anaerobes seems feasible. there was a correlation of hydrolysis with several important pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == comparison of schaedler agar and trypticase soy-yeast extract agar for the cultivation of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == schaedler agar (sa) and trypticase soy-yeast extract agar (tsyea), both supplemented with rabbit blood (5%, v/v) and menadione (0.5 mg/liter), were compared with respect to quantitative recovery, quality of growth, and rapidity of growth of selected anaerobic bacteria. the media were stored for 2 to 4 days prior to use in an anaerobic glove box, where all subsequent bacteriological procedures were performed. after 24 hr of incubation, colonies of clostridium cadaveris (c. capitovale), c. haemolyticum, c. novyi a, and c. perfringens were larger on sa than on tsyea, and the appearance of c. novyi b colonies on sa at 24 hr antedated their appearance on tsyea. quantitative recovery of c. novyi b was improved on sa; recovery of the other clostridia tested was comparable on the two media (inconclusive results were obtained with c. novyi a). rough colonial types  of some of the clostridia emerged on sa. no appreciable differences in results with the two media were noted for bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, or fusobacterium fusiforme.
