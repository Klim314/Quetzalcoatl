TI  - Alkaliphilic endoxylanase from lignocellulolytic microbial consortium metagenome  for biobleaching of eucalyptus pulp.
AB  - Enzymatic pre-bleaching by modification of pulp fibers with xylanases is an attractive approach to reduce the consumption of toxic bleaching chemicals in the paper industry. In this study, an alkaliphilic endoxylanase gene was isolated from metagenomic DNA of a structurally stable thermophilic lignocellulose-degrading microbial consortium using amplification with conserved glycosyl hydrolase family 10 primers and subsequent genome walking. The full-length xylanase showed 78% sequence identity to an endo-beta-1,4-xylanase of Clostridium phytofermentans and was expressed in a mature form with an N-terminal His6 tag fusion in Escherichia coli. The recombinant xylanase Xyn3F was thermotolerant and alkaliphilic, working optimally at 65-70 degrees C with an optimal pH at 9- 10 and retaining >80% activity at pH 9, 60 degrees C for 1 h. Xyn3F showed a Vmax of 2,327 IU/mg and Km of 3.5 mg/ml on birchwood xylan. Pre-bleaching of industrial eucalyptus pulp with no prior pH adjustment (pH 9) using Xyn3F at 50 IU/g dried pulp led to 4.5-5.1% increase in final pulp brightness and 90.4-102.4% increase in whiteness after a single-step hypochlorite bleaching over the untreated pulp, which allowed at least 20% decrease in hypochlorite consumption to achieve the same final bleaching indices. The alkaliphilic xylanase is promising for application in an environmentally friendly bleaching step of kraft and soda pulps with no requirement for pH adjustment, leading to improved economic feasibility of the process.
TI  - 3-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-rhamnose phosphorylase from Clostridium phytofermentans.
AB  - We found an unreported activity of phosphorylase catalyzed by a protein (Cphy1019) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 65 (GH65) from Clostridium phytofermentans. The recombinant Cphy1019 produced in Escherichia coli did not phosphorolyze alpha-linked glucobioses, such as trehalose (alpha1-alpha1), kojibiose (alpha1-2), nigerose (alpha1-3), and maltose (alpha1-4), which are typical substrates for GH65 enzymes. In reverse phosphorolysis, Cphy1019 utilized only l-rhamnose as the acceptor among various sugars examined with beta-d-glucose 1-phosphate as the donor. The reaction product was determined to be 3-O-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-l-rhamnose, indicating strict alpha1-3 regioselectivity. We propose 3-O-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-l-rhamnose: phosphate beta-d-glucosyltransferase as the systematic name and 3-O-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-l-rhamnose phosphorylase as the short name for this novel GH65 phosphorylase.
TI  - Discovery of nigerose phosphorylase from Clostridium phytofermentans.
AB  - A novel phosphorylase from Clostridium phytofermentans belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 65 (Cphy1874) was characterized. The recombinant Cphy1874 protein produced in Escherichia coli showed phosphorolytic activity on nigerose in the presence of inorganic phosphate, resulting in the release of D-glucose and beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate (beta-G1P) with the inversion of the anomeric configuration. Kinetic parameters of the phosphorolytic activity on nigerose were k(cat) = 67 s(-1) and K(m) = 1.7 mM. This enzyme did not phosphorolyze substrates for the typical GH65 enzymes such as trehalose, maltose, and trehalose 6-phosphate except for a weak phosphorolytic activity on kojibiose. It showed the highest reverse phosphorolytic activity in the reverse reaction using D-glucose as the acceptor and beta-G1P as the donor, and the product was mostly nigerose at the early stage of the reaction. The enzyme also showed reverse phosphorolytic activity, in a decreasing order, on D-xylose, 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol, D-galactose, and methyl-alpha-D-glucoside. All major products were alpha-1,3-glucosyl disaccharides, although the reaction with D-xylose and methyl-alpha-D-glucoside produced significant amounts of alpha-1,2-glucosides as by-products. We propose 3-alpha-D-glucosyl-D-glucose:phosphate beta-D-glucosyltransferase as the systematic name and nigerose phosphorylase as the short name for this Cphy1874 protein.
TI  - Engineering of Clostridium phytofermentans Endoglucanase Cel5A for improved thermostability.
AB  - A family 5 glycoside hydrolase from Clostridium phytofermentans was cloned and engineered through a cellulase cell surface display system in Escherichia coli. The presence of cell surface anchoring, a cellulose binding module, or a His tag greatly influenced the activities of wild-type and mutant enzymes on soluble and solid cellulosic substrates, suggesting the high complexity of cellulase engineering. The best mutant had 92%, 36%, and 46% longer half-lives at 60 degrees C on carboxymethyl cellulose, regenerated amorphous cellulose, and Avicel, respectively.
TI  - Glycoside hydrolase family 9 processive endoglucanase from Clostridium phytofermentans: heterologous expression, characterization, and synergy with family 48 cellobiohydrolase.
AB  - The glycoside hydrolase family 9 cellulase (Cel9) from Clostridium phytofermentans has a multi-modular structure and is essential for cellulose hydrolysis. In order to facilitate production and purification of Cel9, recombinant Cel9 was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. Cel9 exhibited maximum activity at pH 6.5 and 65 degrees C on carboxymethyl cellulose in a 10-min reaction period. The hydrolysis products on regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC) were cellotetraose (a major product), cellotriose, cellobiose and glucose, and 71-80% of the reducing sugars produced by Cel9 were in soluble form, suggesting that Cel9 was a processive endoglucanase. The highest synergy between C. phytofermentans Cel9 and C. phytofermentans cellobiohydrolase Cel48 on Avicel was about 1.8 at a ratio of about 1:5. Cel9 alone was sufficient to solublize filter paper while Cel48 was not; however, it enhanced the solublization process along with Cel9 synergistically. This study provided useful information for understanding of the cellulose hydrolysis mechanism of this cellulolytic bacterium with potential industrial importance.
TI  - The noncellulosomal family 48 cellobiohydrolase from Clostridium phytofermentans  ISDg: heterologous expression, characterization, and processivity.
AB  - Family 48 glycoside hydrolases (cellobiohydrolases) are among the most important  cellulase components for crystalline cellulose hydrolysis mediated by cellulolytic bacteria. Open reading frame (Cphy_3368) of Clostridium phytofermentans ISDg encodes a putative family 48 glycoside hydrolase (CpCel48) with a family 3 cellulose-binding module. CpCel48 was successfully expressed as two soluble intracellular forms with or without a C-terminal His-tag in Escherichia coli and as a secretory active form in Bacillus subtilis. It was found that calcium ion enhanced activity and thermostability of the enzyme. CpCel48 had high activities of 15.1 U micromol(-1) on Avicel and 35.9 U micromol(-1) on regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC) with cellobiose as a main product and cellotriose and cellotetraose as by-products. By contrast, it had very weak activities on soluble cellulose derivatives (e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)) and did not significantly decrease the viscosity of the CMC solution. Cellotetraose was the smallest oligosaccharide substrate for CpCel48. Since processivity is a key characteristic for cellobiohydrolases, the new initial false/right attack model was developed for estimation of processivity by considering the enzyme's substrate specificity, the crystalline structure of homologous Cel48 enzymes, and the configuration of cellulose chains. The processivities of CpCel48 on Avicel and RAC were estimated to be approximately 3.5 and 6.0, respectively. Heterologous expression of secretory active cellobiohydrolase in B. subtilis is an important step for developing recombinant cellulolytic B. subtilis strains for low-cost production of advanced biofuels from cellulosic materials in a single step.
TI  - Targeted gene inactivation in Clostridium phytofermentans shows that cellulose degradation requires the family 9 hydrolase Cphy3367.
AB  - Summary Microbial cellulose degradation is a central part of the global carbon cycle and has great potential for the development of inexpensive, carbon-neutral biofuels from non-food crops. Clostridium phytofermentans has a repertoire of 108 putative glycoside hydrolases to break down cellulose and hemicellulose into sugars, which this organism then ferments primarily to ethanol. An understanding of cellulose degradation at the molecular level requires learning the different roles of these hydrolases. In this study, we show that interspecific conjugation with Escherichia coli can be used to transfer a plasmid into C. phytofermentans that has a resistance marker, an origin of replication that can be selectively lost, and a designed group II intron for efficient, targeted chromosomal insertions without selection. We applied these methods to disrupt the cphy3367 gene, which encodes the sole family 9 glycoside hydrolase (GH9) in the C. phytofermentans genome. The GH9-deficient strain grew normally on some carbon sources such as glucose, but had lost the ability to degrade cellulose. Although C. phytofermentans upregulates the expression of numerous enzymes to break down cellulose, this process thus relies upon a single, key hydrolase, Cphy3367.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene for cellobiose 2-epimerase from a ruminal strain of Eubacterium cellulosolvens.
AB  - Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE; EC 5.1.3.11) is known to catalyze the reversible epimerization of cellobiose to 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose in Ruminococcus albus cells. Here, we report a CE in a ruminal strain of Eubacterium cellulosolvens for the first time. The nucleotide sequence of the CE had an ORF of 1218 bp (405 amino acids; 46 963.3 Da). The CE from E. cellulosolvens showed 44-54% identity to N-acyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase-like hypothetical proteins in the genomes of Coprococcus eutactus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium phytofermentans, Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, and Eubacterium siraeum. Surprisingly, it exhibited only 46% identity to a CE from R. albus. The recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli was purified by two-step chromatography. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 46.7 kDa and exhibited optimal activity at around 35 degrees C and pH 7.0-8.5. In addition to cello-oligosaccharides, it converted lactose to epilactose (4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-mannose).
