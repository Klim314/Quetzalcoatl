TI  - Pathogenicity of bacteria isolated from gut of Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and fitness costs of insect associated with consumption of bacteria.
AB  - Gut microbes contribute to the health of insects and perturbations in the composition or location of gut microbiota can lead to pathological states and host mortality. We explored the culturable bacterial community in the gut of Spodoptera litura (Fab.) larvae, which is a polyphagous pest. Bacterial isolates were identified as Microbacterium arborescens (SL6), Enterococcus casseliflavus (SL10) and Enterobacter cloacae (SL11) by using culture dependent technique based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Screening of these three isolates for insecticidal potential against the same host i.e. S. litura indicated the highest larval mortality in E. cloacae (73.33%). Further, we assessed the effect of E. cloacae (SL11) infection on growth and development of S. litura. A significant effect of E. cloacae was observed on various biological parameters viz. larval and pupal period, total development period and reproductive potential of S. litura. E. cloacae significantly influenced the immune response of S. litura. A marked decrease in total hemocyte count was observed in larvae infected with E. cloacae whereas lysozyme and phenoloxidase activity increased initially followed by a decline. The gut microbial diversity in larvae infected with E. cloacae differed from control larvae. The population of E. cloacae in the gut of infected larvae exceeded over the other two microbes and resulted in pathogenicity and death of S. litura larvae. This indicates that E. cloacae can have the potential to be used as a promising biological control agent.
TI  - Communal microaerophilic-aerobic biodegradation of Amaranth by novel NAR-2 bacterial consortium.
AB  - A novel bacterial consortium, NAR-2 which consists of Citrobacter freundii A1, Enterococcus casseliflavus C1 and Enterobacter cloacae L17 was investigated for biodegradation of Amaranth azo dye under sequential microaerophilic-aerobic condition. The NAR-2 bacterial consortium with E. casseliflavus C1 as the dominant strain enhanced the decolorization process resulting in reduction of Amaranth in 30 min. Further aerobic biodegradation, which was dominated by C. freundii A1 and E. cloacae L17, allowed biotransformation of azo reduction intermediates and mineralization via metabolic pathways including benzoyl-CoA, protocatechuate, salicylate, gentisate, catechol and cinnamic acid. The presence of autoxidation products which could be metabolized to 2-oxopentenoate was elucidated. The biodegradation mechanism of Amaranth by NAR-2 bacterial consortium was predicted to follow the steps of azo reduction, deamination, desulfonation and aromatic ring cleavage. This is for the first time the comprehensive microaerophilic-aerobic biotransformation pathways of Amaranth dye intermediates by bacterial consortium are being proposed.
TI  - A pseudoepidemic due to laboratory contamination deciphered by molecular analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A clinical, microbiological, and molecular analysis to identify the source of a cluster of pseudoinfections. DESIGNS: Retrospective analysis of the cases, prospective epidemiologic survey, and laboratory investigation. Molecular analysis of the isolates was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). SETTING: A tertiary Veterans Affairs medical center. PATIENTS: Three patients admitted over a 2-week period with musculoskeletal complaints had one or more joint fluid specimens submitted for culture. In each case, anaerobic chopped meat-glucose broth (CMGB) tubes yielded one or more organisms not typically associated with septic arthritis (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia hermannii, and Pseudomonas diminuti). The first three organisms were isolated from specimens from multiple patients. Two patients had multiple positive cultures; for two patients, separate cultures yielded additional organisms on solid media. RESULTS: Laboratory investigation yielded an isolate of E faecium from 1 of 30 sham-inoculated CMGB tubes. PFGE analysis demonstrated that a single strain of E cloacae was isolated from four CMGB tubes representing all three patients, and a single strain of E faecium was isolated from CMGB tubes representing two patients and the sham-inoculated tube. CONCLUSIONS: The application of molecular typing clearly demonstrated clonality among the isolates and indicated that a common source of contamination, most likely the CMGB tubes, was responsible for these cases.
