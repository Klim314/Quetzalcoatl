TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from Jatropha dioica roots.
AB  - The antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant Jatropha dioica (Euphorbiaceae) were investigated. In order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Sporothrix schenckii. Results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. The activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. The hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines Chang, OK and LLCPK-1 (IC50>1000 mug mL(-1)).
TI  - Molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae from humans in the community.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant Enterobacteriaceae collected during a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence and risk factors for faecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in humans living in areas with high or low broiler density. METHODS: ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were identified by combination disc-diffusion test. ESBL/AmpC/carbapenemase genes were analysed using PCR and sequencing. For E. coli, phylogenetic groups and MLST were determined. Plasmids were characterized by transformation and PCR-based replicon typing. Subtyping of plasmids was done by plasmid multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: 175 ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were cultured from 165/1,033 individuals. The isolates were Escherichia coli(n=65), Citrobacter freundii (n=52), Enterobacter cloacae (n=38), Morganella morganii (n=5), Enterobacter aerogenes (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=3), Hafnia alvei (n=2), Shigella spp. (n=2), Citrobacter amalonaticus (n=1), Escherichia hermannii (n=1), Kluyvera cryocrescens (n=1), and Pantoea agglomerans (n=1). The following ESBL genes were recovered in 55 isolates originating from 49 of 1,033 (4.7 %) persons: blaCTX-M-1 (n=17), blaCTX-M-15 (n=16), blaCTX-M-14 (n=9), blaCTX-M-2 (n=3), blaCTX-M-3 (n=2), blaCTX-M-24 (n=2), blaCTX-M-27 (n=1), blaCTX-M-32 (n=1), blaSHV-12 (n=2), blaSHV-65 (n=1) and blaTEM-52 (n=1). Plasmidic AmpC (pAmpC) genes were discovered in 6 out of 1,033 (0.6 %) persons. One person carried two different E. coli isolates, one with blaCTX-M-1 and the other with blaCMY-2 and therefore the prevalence of persons carrying Enterobacteriaceae harboring ESBL and/or pAmpC genes was 5.2 %. In eight E. coli isolates the AmpC phenotype was caused by mutations in the AmpC promoter region. No carbapenemase genes were identified. A large variety of E. coli genotypes was found, ST131 and ST10 being most common. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL/pAmpC genes resembled those from patients in Dutch hospitals, indicating that healthy humans form a reservoir for transmission of these determinants to vulnerable people. The role of poultry in the transmission to humans in the community remains to be elucidated.
TI  - Proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  - We examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of LB Bulgaricum PLC for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grown in goat milk. The aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by LAB, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. Whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. The proteolytic activity of Lactococcus lactis l598, Streptococcus thermophilus t3D1, Dt1, Lactobacillus lactis 1043 and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. The proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. Most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella cholere enteridis, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterobacter aerogenes. The most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. The starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. The greatest antimicrobial activity of the cultures was detected against E. aerogenes. The obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. The present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of LB Bulgaricum PLC.
TI  - Antimicrobial, antitumor and brine shrimp lethality assay of Ranunculus arvensis  L. extracts.
AB  - To investigate the antitumor activity, brine shrimp lethality assay, antibacterial and antifungal activity of Methanol Extract (ME), Water Extract (WE), Acetone Extract (AE), Chloroform Extract (CE), Methanol-Water Extract (MWE), Methanol-Acetone Extract (MAE), Methanol-Chloroform Extract (MCE) of Ranunculus arvensis (L.). Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At10) induced potato disc assay. Cytotoxicity was evaluated with brine shrimp lethality assay. Antibacterial activity was evaluated with six bacterial strains including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus and Streptococcus anginosus and antifungal screening was done against five fungal strains including Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. fumigates, Fusarium solani and Mucor species by using disc diffusion method. Best antitumor activity was obtained with ME and WE, having highest IC50 values 20.27 +/- 1.62 and 93.01 +/- 1.33mug/disc. Brine shrimp lethality assay showed LC50 values of AE, MAE and ME were obtained as 384.66 +/- 9.42mug/ml, 724.11 +/- 8.01mug/ml and 978.7 +/-8.01 mug/ml respectively. WE of R. arvensis revealed weak antimicrobial result against the tested microorganisms. On the other hand, the antifungal activity of the plant extracts was found to be insignificant. These findings demonstrate that extracts of R. arvensis possesses significant antitumor activity. Further extensive study is necessary to assess the therapeutic potential of the plant.
TI  - An efficient ribitol-specific dehydrogenase from Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - An NAD(+)-dependent ribitol dehydrogenase from Enterobacter aerogenes KCTC 2190 (EaRDH) was cloned and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. The complete 729-bp gene was amplified, cloned, expressed, and subsequently purified in an active soluble form using nickel affinity chromatography. The enzyme had an optimal pH and temperature of 11.0 and 45 degrees C, respectively. Among various polyols, EaRDH exhibited activity only toward ribitol, with Km, Vmax, and kcat/Km values of 10.3mM, 185Umg(-1), and 30.9s(-1)mM(-1), respectively. The enzyme showed strong preference for NAD(+) and displayed no detectable activity with NADP(+). Homology modeling and sequence analysis of EaRDH, along with its biochemical properties, confirmed that EaRDH belongs to the family of NAD(+)-dependent ribitol dehydrogenases, a member of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SCOR) family. EaRDH showed the highest activity and unique substrate specificity among all known RDHs. Homology modeling and docking analysis shed light on the molecular basis of its unusually high activity and substrate specificity.
TI  - 2-Alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-thiones, 2-R-(quinazolin-4(3H)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides: synthesis, molecular docking, antimicrobial and anticancer properties.
AB  - In this study, a series of novel 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-thiones, 2-R-(quinazolin-4(3H)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Their structure was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data (FT-IR, LC-MS, 1H-NMR). Antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Candida albicans and NCI in vitro preliminary anticancer activity against nine different cancer types. The most active antibacterial and antifungal compounds were: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. The introduction of the carboxylic acid or amide residue into the fourth position of quinazolin-4(3H)-thione resulted in the absence of antimicrobial activity. Substance 3.8 inhibited renal cancer UO-31 line and 2.18 - leukemia CCRF-CEM. The results of in silico molecular docking for DHFR and CK2 kinase had no correlation with in vitro properties, proposing the presence of other biological activity pathways.
TI  - Separation and confirmation of nine Enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the gene.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to confirm the existence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae carrying the bla NDM-1 gene in clinics in Hainan province, China. Collected clinical bacterial isolates that were Enterobacteriaceae strains suspected of producing carbapenemase were used as experimental strains. Drug resistance to imipenem, meropenem and other antibacterial agents was tested. Imipenem/imipenem inhibitor (IP/IPI) E-testing was conducted to identify the bacterial strains that produced metallo-beta-lactamases. The bla NDM-1 drug resistance gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) and sequencing were conducted to identify the products. The species of the strains carrying the bla NDM-1 gene were determined using a biochemical identification system. Through the IP/IPI E-test, 21 of the 30 collected Enterobacteriaceae strains were found to be positive, indicating that 70% of the strains produced metallo-beta-lactamases. Following bla NDM-1 gene PCR amplification, AGE and sequencing tests confirmed that nine of the strains carried the bla NDM-1 drug resistance gene. The biochemical identification system indicated that four of the strains were Klebsiella pneumoniae, two were Escherichia coli, two were Enterobacter cloacae and one was Enterobacter aerogenes. Drug susceptibility testing in vitro demonstrated that the strains were 100% resistant to a broad spectrum antibiotic plus lactamase inhibitor, cephalosporins and carbapenems. However, they had high sensitivity rates to polymyxin B and tigecycline of 100 and 88.9%, respectively. The sensitivity rate to amikacin was also high at 77.8%, whereas sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was moderate at rates of 44.4 and 33.3% respectively. This clinical study of Enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the bla NDM-1 gene in Hainan shows a bacterial tolerance that is different from that in previous studies, which requires further in-depth study.
TI  - Predominance of KPC-3 in a Survey for Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae  in Portugal.
AB  - Among the 2,105 Enterobacteriaceae tested in a survey done in Portugal, 165 were  nonsusceptible to carbapenems, from which 35 (26 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 Escherichia coli, 2 Enterobacter aerogenes, and 3 Enterobacter cloacae isolates and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca isolate) were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers by the presence of 30 Tn4401d-blaKPC-3, 4 intI3-blaGES-5, and one intI1-blaVIM-2 gene, alone or in combination with other bla genes. The dissemination of blaKPC-3 gene carried by an IncF plasmid suggests lateral gene transfer as a major mechanism of dissemination.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against European Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Recent clinical isolates of key Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four European countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/L avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. Against Enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. MIC90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90% of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. A two-fold reduction in the MIC90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/L was noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam, whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the MIC values of the test compounds when tested against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Haemophilus influenzae. It had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. This study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa but not against A. baumannii.
TI  - Extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated from vegetables imported from the Dominican Republic, India, Thailand, and Vietnam.
AB  - To examine to what extent fresh vegetables imported into Switzerland represent carriers of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, 169 samples of different types of fresh vegetables imported into Switzerland from the Dominican Republic, India, Thailand, and Vietnam were analyzed. Overall, 25.4% of the vegetable samples yielded one or more ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, 78.3% of which were multidrug resistant. Sixty isolates were obtained: Escherichia coli, 26; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Enterobacter aerogenes, 1; and Cronobacter sakazakii, 1. We found 29 isolates producing CTX-M-15, 8 producing CTX-M-14, 7 producing CTX-M-55, 3 producing CTX-M-65, 1 each producing CTX-M-1, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-27, and CTX-M-63, 5 producing SHV-2, 3 producing SHV-12, and 1 producing SHV-2a. Four of the E. coli isolates belonged to epidemiologically important clones: CTX-M-15-producing B2:ST131 (1 isolate), D:ST405 (1 isolate), and D:ST38 (2 isolates). One of the D:ST38 isolates belonged to the extraintestinal enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) D:ST38 lineage. Two of the K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to the epidemic clones sequence type 15 (ST15) and ST147. The occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic and commensal Enterobacteriaceae in imported agricultural foodstuffs constitutes a source of ESBL genes and a concern for food safety.
TI  - Spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  - Ac-GF(A6c)G(A6c)K(A6c)G(A6c)F(A6c)G(A6c)GK(A6c)KKKK-amide (A6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43muM. Spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this AMP interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. CD and 2D-(1)H NMR experiments indicated this AMP on binding to SDS and DPC micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages of helical and random coil conformers. CD investigations in the presence of three phospholipid SUVs consisting of POPC, 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC revealed: (1) The interactions occurring with POPC SUVs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the AMP yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) The interactions with 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC SUVs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the CD spectra. (3) The presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of SUVs as was the case with micelles. This data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this AMP are very different from the diversity of conformations adopted by this AMP on insertion into the lipid bilayer. CD spectra of this AMP in the presence of SUVs consisting of LPS isolated from P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - Safety, efficacy and utility of methods of transferring adhesive and cohesive Escherichia coli cells to microplates to avoid aerosols.
AB  - The virtual colony count (VCC) microbiological assay has been utilized for over a decade to measure the antimicrobial activity of peptides such as defensins and LL-37 against biosafety level (BSL)-1 and BSL-2 bacteria including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterobacter aerogenes. In addition, a modified pipetting technique was presented in a 2011 study of defensin activity against the BSL-3 pathogen Bacillus anthracis. Both studies were published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. Here I report that the method can also detect cross-contamination caused by aerosols utilizing the VCC method of data analysis by quantitative growth kinetics (QGK). The QGK threshold time, or T t, equivalent to the cycle time C t reported in 1996 by Heid et al., precisely identifies when wells were inoculated.
TI  - Probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from sorghum-based traditional fermented food.
AB  - Sorghum-based traditional fermented food was screened for potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria. The isolates were identified by biochemical, physiological and genetic methods. Species identification was done by 16s rRNA sequence analysis. The functional probiotic potential of the two Lactobacillus species viz., Lactobacillus plantarum (Lact. plantarum) and Lactobacillus pentosus (Lact. pentosus) was assessed by different standard parameters. The strains were tolerant to pH 2 for 1 h and resistant to methicillin, kanamycin, vancomycin and norfloxacin. Two (Lact. plantarum COORG-3 and Lact. pentosus COORG-8) out of eight isolates recorded the cell surface hydrophobicity to be 59.12 and 64.06 %, respectively. All the strains showed tolerance to artificial duodenum juice (pH 2) for 3 h, positive for bile salt hydrolase test and negative for haemolytic test. The neutralized cell-free supernatant of the strains Lact. pentosus COORG-4, Lact. plantarum COORG-1, Lact. plantarum COORG-7, Lact. pentosus COORG-8 and Lact. plantarum COORG-3 showed good antibiofilm activity. Lact. pentosus COORG-8 exhibited 74 % activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa-MTCC 7903 and Lact. plantarum COORG-7 showed 68 % inhibition of biofilm against Klebsiella pneumonia MTCC 7407. Three (Lact. plantarum COORG-7, Lact. pentosus COORG-5 and Lact. pentosus COORG 8) out of eight isolates exhibited a good antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes and five isolates (Lact. pentosus COORG 2, Lact. plantarum COORG 1, Lact. plantarum COORG 4, Lact. pentosus COORG 3 and Lact. plantarum COORG 6) are active against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis. The study also evaluated the cholesterol lowering property of the Lactobacillus strains using hen egg yolk as the cholesterol source. The cholesterol in hen egg yolk was assimilated by 74.12 and 68.26 % by Lact. plantarum COORG 4 and Lact. pentosus COORG 7, respectively. The results of the present study suggest that the Lactobacillus strains isolated and characterized from sorghum-based fermented product may be used as probiotic strains for therapeutic applications.
TI  - Prevalence and Antibiotic Resistance of Gram-Negative Pathogenic Bacteria Species Isolated from Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica in Varanasi, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroaches are among the medically important pests found within the  human habitations that cause serious public health problems. They may harbor a number of pathogenic bacteria on the external surface with antibiotic resistance. Hence, they are regarded as major microbial vectors. This study investigates the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria species isolated from Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica in Varanasi, India. METHODS: Totally, 203 adult cockroaches were collected form 44 households and 52 food-handling establishments by trapping. Bacteriological examination of external surfaces of Pe. americana and Bl. germanica were carried out using standard method and antibiotics susceptibility profiles of the isolates were determined using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion methods. RESULTS: Among the places, we found that 54% had cockroache infestation in households and 77% in food- handling establishments. There was no significant different between the overall bacteria load of the external surface in Pe. americana (64.04%) and Bl. germanica (35.96%). However the predominant bacteria on cockroaches were Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, Kl. pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa were the most prevalent, drug-resistant strains were isolated from the cockroaches with 100% resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and ampicillin. For individual strains of bacteria, Escherichia coli was found to have multi-resistance to four antibiotic tested, Citrobacter freundii four, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis to three. CONCLUSION: Cockroaches are uniformly distributed in domestic environment, which can be a possible vector for transmission of drug-resistant bacteria and food-borne diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of five medicinal plants against multidrug-resistant enteropathogenic bacteria infecting under-5 hospitalized children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro antibacterial effectiveness of five medicinal plants used by an Indian aborigine, against 8 multidrug-resistant (MDR) enteropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of under-5 hospitalized children. METHODS: Antibiotic sensitivity patterns of eight clinically isolated strains of enteropathogenic bacteria, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella paratyphi, S. typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei and Vibrio cholerae were assessed by disc-diffusion method. Antibacterial activities of 8 solvent-extracts of leaves and bark of five medicinal plants were monitored by the agar-well diffusion method. The microbroth dilution method was used to assess minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Qualitative phytochemical analyses of active plant extracts were carried out. RESULTS: Ethanol, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of Holarrhena antidysenterica leaf tissue were most effective against 8 MDR pathogens in vitro. Similarly, acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts of Terminalia alata leaf tissue; chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of Terminalia arjuna leaf tissue and ethyl acetate, ethanol and methanol extracts of Paederia foetida leaf tissue were most effective in inhibiting in vitro growth of the 8 MDR enteropathogens. Ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of H. antidysenterica bark tissue; acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts of T. alata bark tissue and acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts of T. arjuna bark tissue were most effective in controlling enteropathogen growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values of the 3 most antimicrobial leaf and bark extracts from the five plants were in the range of 1.56 to 50 mg/mL. CONCLUSION: These 5 plants exhibited in vitro control over a cohort of 8 enteropathogenic bacterial strains isolated from clinical samples.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial evaluation of the essential oils of Bocageopsis pleiosperma Maas.
AB  - Essential oils from the leaves, twigs and barks of Bocageopsis pleiosperma Maas were obtained by using hydrodistillation and analysed by using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Several compounds (51) were detected and identified, being beta-bisabolene the main component in all aerial parts of the plant, with higher concentration in the leaves (55.77%), followed by barks (38.53%) and twigs (34.37%). In order to increase the biological knowledge about the essential oil of Bocageopsis species, antimicrobial activities were evaluated against the microorganisms Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Candida tropicalis, Candida dubliniensis, Candida glabrata and Candida albicans. The essential oil obtained from the barks exhibited a moderate effect against S. epidermidis ATCC 1228 (MIC = 250 mug/mL), while the other oils did not exhibit antimicrobial activity. These results represent the first report about the chemical composition of B. pleiosperma and the first antimicrobial evaluation with a Bocageopsis species.
TI  - Four carbapenem-resistant gram-negative species carrying distinct carbapenemases  in a single patient.
AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from a single patient, each producing different carbapenemases (NDM-1, KPC-2, IMP, and OXA-23, respectively). The NDM-1-producing E. coli strain was preceded by a clonally related carbapenem-susceptible strain a month earlier, suggesting in vivo acquisition of blaNDM-1.
TI  - Activity of eravacycline against Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii,  including multidrug-resistant isolates, from New York City.
AB  - Eravacycline demonstrated in vitro activity against a contemporary collection of  more than 4,000 Gram-negative pathogens from New York City hospitals, with MIC50/MIC90 values, respectively, for Escherichia coli of 0.12/0.5 mug/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae of 0.25/1 mug/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes of 0.25/1 mug/ml, Enterobacter cloacae 0.5/1 mug/ml, and Acinetobacter baumannii of 0.5/1 mug/ml. Activity was retained against multidrug-resistant isolates, including those expressing KPC and OXA carbapenemases. For A. baumannii, eravacycline MICs correlated with increased expression of the adeB gene.
TI  - Effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  - Antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. White mustard essential oil (WMEO) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. The objective of this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of WMEO against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. The bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. All microorganisms were inhibited by WMEO at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). In general, WMEO was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. Salmonella Enteritidis and S. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. The effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. Soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of WMEO against L. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against Salmonella Enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h. Sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of WMEO against Salmonella Enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against L. monocytogenes. The presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of WMEO against L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis. Thus, WMEO is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.
TI  - Purification of a secreted lectin from Andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - A lectin secreted from Andrias davidianus skin (ADL) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type III) (PSM)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and HPLC on TSK gel G3000PWXL. The purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. SDS-PAGE showed that the ADL protein had a molecular mass of 17 kDa. ADL produced an 8.5 kDa band when examined using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. ADL agglutinated native and trypsinized human B erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as PSM and asialo-PSM, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. The activity was stable between 4 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Significant ADL activity was observed between pH 4-5. The lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation Ca2+ or Mg2+. The N-terminal ADL sequence was determined to be VGYTVGATPM. The lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Shewanella sp. Furthermore, ADL showed inhibition activity against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These findings suggest that ADL plays an important role in the innate immunity of A. davidianus on the body surface.
TI  - Infected hydatid cysts bacteria in slaughtered livestock and their effects on protoscoleces degeneration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The protoscoleces of fertile hydatid cysts are considered as major risks in surgery and producing secondary cysts if rupture the cyst during operation and, cause infecting the dogs with adult worm if eaten by this animal. Bacterial infection of the hydatid fluid can lead to sterilization of the cyst. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the bacterial infection rate of livestock hydatid cysts in Hamedan, Iran, and test the isolated bacteria effects on viable protoscoleces, in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 5709 slaughtered livestock were inspected to detect the presence of hydatid cysts. The hydatid fluid of all cysts was cultured separately to isolate and identify the bacteria. The effect of isolated bacteria was tested on viable protoscoleces in culture tubes, in vitro. The culture tubes were observed and examined under a light microscope every two hours for 24 hours, and then, after 36 and 48 hours. RESULTS: Infected cysts were found in 74% of animals in Hamedan (46% were calcified and the bacteria was isolated from 52%) and 62% in Borujerd. The isolated bacteria in the infected cysts were as follows: Escherichia coli, E. blattae, Klebsiella pnoumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Edwardsiella tarda. The protoscoleces incubated with the isolated bacteria totally degenerated, but 55% of the protoscoleces in the control groups were intact and viable even after one week. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated a high percentage of cysts bacterial infections in two provinces of Iran. The common isolated bacteria were E. coli and Klebsiella. The isolated bacteria degenerated the protoscoleces during short-time incubation, in vitro.
TI  - The preliminary assessment of anti-microbial activity of HPLC separated components of Kirkia wilmsii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most communities in developing countries rely on traditional medicines for the treatment of diseases. In South Africa, the Limpopo province, within the Lebowakgomo district, uses tuberous roots of Kirkia wilmsii, after infusion in water for the treatment of a wide range of diseases by Sotho communities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main objective of the study was to assess the anti-microbial activity of separated aqueous components of the Kirkia wilmsii tuberous roots. The clear aqueous extracts that were obtained after a 0.45 microm membrane filtration (Millipore Millex-HV Hydrophillic PVDF filter), were then injected into a preparative high performance liquid chromatography instrument in which pure components, as shown by peaks, were collected and evaluated for anti-microbial activity against a range of microorganisms. RESULTS: The eight separated components were obtained, out of which four components showed anti-microbial activity (AMA). The freeze dried components were re-dissolved in deionised water and then evaluated for AMA against Vibrio cholerae, Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella typhi Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Enterobacter aerogenes. Component one exhibited antimicrobial activity against Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), of 3.445 mg/ml. Component five was only active against Proteus mirabilis with a MIC of 0.08 mg/ml. Component 7, was active against Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with a MIC of 0.365 mg/ml against both Shigella dysenteriae and Staphylococcus aureus and 0.091 mg/ml against Escherichia coli. Component 8, was active against Shigella, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli with a MIC of 155 mg/ml. CONCLUSION: Only four out of eight aqueous extracts showed AMA against both gram negative and positive bacteria and showed no AMA against Candida albicans, Enterobacter aerogenes and Vibrio cholerae. Therefore the Kirkia wilmsii plant root may be used as a broad spectrum antibiotic.
TI  - First report of a clinical, multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolate coharboring fosfomycin resistance gene fosA3 and carbapenemase gene blaKPC-2 on the same transposon, Tn1721.
AB  - In order to understand the genetic background and dissemination mechanism of carbapenem resistance and fosfomycin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae isolates, we studied a clinical Escherichia coli strain HS102707 isolate and an Enterobacter aerogenes strain HS112625 isolate, both of which were resistant to carbapenem and fosfomycin and positive for the bla(KPC-2) and fosA3 genes. In addition, a clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae strain HS092839 isolate which was resistant to carbapenem was also studied. A 70-kb plasmid was successfully transferred to recipient E. coli J53 by a conjugation test. PCR and Southern blot analysis showed that bla(KPC-2) was located on this plasmid. The complete sequence of pHS102707 showed that this plasmid belongs to the P11 subfamily (IncP1) and has a replication gene, several plasmid-stable genes, an intact type IV secretion system gene cluster, and a composite transposon Tn1721-Tn3 that harbored bla(KPC-2). Interestingly, a composite IS26 transposon carrying fosA3 was inserted in the Tn1721-tnpA gene in pHS102707 and pHS112625, leading to the disruption of Tn1721-tnpA and the deletion of Tn1721-tnpR. However, only IS26 with a truncated Tn21-tnpR was inserted in pHS092839 at the same position. To our knowledge, this is the first report of fosA3 and bla(KPC-2) colocated in the same Tn1721-Tn3-like composite transposon on a novel IncP group plasmid.
TI  - Phenotypic and molecular characteristics of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in a health care system in Los Angeles, California, from 2011 to 2013.
AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are a concern for health care in the United States but remain relatively uncommon in California. We describe the phenotype, clonality, and carbapenemase-encoding genes present in CRE isolated from patients at a Californian tertiary health care system. CRE for this study were identified by evaluating the antibiograms of Enterobacteriaceae isolated in the UCLA Health System from 2011 to 2013 for isolates that were not susceptible to meropenem and/or imipenem. The identification of these isolates was subsequently confirmed by matrix-associated laser desorption ionization-time of flight, and broth microdilution tests were repeated to confirm the CRE phenotype. Real-time PCR for bla(KPC), bla(SME), bla(IMP), bla(NDM-1), bla(VIM), and bla(OXA-48) was performed. Clonality was assessed by repetitive sequence-based PCR (repPCR) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Of 15,839 nonduplicate clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 115 (0.73%) met the study definition for CRE. This number increased from 0.5% (44/8165) in the first half of the study to 0.9% (71/7674) in the second (P = 0.004). The most common CRE species were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli. A carbapenemase-encoding gene was found in 81.7% (94/115) of CRE and included bla(KPC) (78.3%), bla(NDM-1) (0.9%), and bla(SME) (2.6%). The majority of bla(KPC) genes were in K. pneumoniae isolates, which fell into 14 clonal groups on typing. bla(KPC) was identified in more than one species of CRE cultured from the same patient in four cases. Three bla(SME)-carrying Serratia marcescens isolates and one bla(NDM-1) carrying Providencia rettgeri isolate were detected. CRE are increasing in California, and carbapenemases, particularly KPC, are a common mechanism for carbapenem resistance in this region.
TI  - Fast and continuous microorganism detection using aptamer-conjugated fluorescent  nanoparticles on an optofluidic platform.
AB  - Fast and accurate pathogen detection in aquatic environments is challenging in many biomedical studies and microbial diagnostic applications. In this study, we developed a real-time, continuous, and non-destructive single cell detection method using target specific aptamer-conjugated fluorescent nanoparticles (A-FNPs) and an optofluidic particle-sensor platform. A-FNPs selectively bound to the surfaces of target bacteria (Escherichia coli) and labeled them with high affinity and selectivity so that target bacteria can be countable particles in an optofluidic particle-sensor. A-FNP-labeled target bacterial complexes were detected by the optofluidic particle-sensing system, which provides rapid and continuous single-cell detection. A-FNPs selectively bound to E. coli with a dissociation constant of 0.83 nM, but did not bind Enterobacter aerogenes or Citrobacter freundii strains, which lacked affinity for the aptamer used. We demonstrated that our optofluidic device achieves a detection throughput of ~100 particles per second with high accuracy (~85%) in detecting single bacterial cells conjugated with A-FNPs. This approach can be immediately extended to the real-time, high-throughput detection of other microorganisms such as viruses that are selectively conjugated with A-FNPs. Collectively, these data suggest that optofluidic systems are widely applicable for the fast and continuous detection of microbial cells.
TI  - Physico-chemical analysis and antimicrobial potential of Apis dorsata, Apis mellifera and Ziziphus jujube honey samples from Pakistan.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate physico-chemical properties and antimicrobial potential of indigenous honey samples against different reference strains including Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeroginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Salmonella typhi ATCC 14028, Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 13883, Aspergillus niger ATCC 16404, Rhizopus oligosporus PCSIR1, Candida albicans ATCC 14053 and Candida utilis ATCC 9950. METHODS: By using standard methods samples were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties including additive effect of starch and non-peroxidase activity, antioxidative properties (phenol contents, flavonoid contents, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity). Prior to this evaluation, complete physico-chemical properties including pH, color, ash contents, protein contents, moisture contents, hydroxymethyl furfural contents, total sugar contents, reducing sugar and non-reducing sugar contents were analyzed. RESULTS: Relatively higher ash contents were found in the Siddar honey i.e. (0.590 0+/-0.033 6)% and small honey showed relatively higher protein contents i.e. (777.598+/-9.880) mg/kg. The moisture contents of tested honey samples ranged between 13.8%-16.6%, total sugar contents from 61.672%-72.420% and non-reducing sugar contents from 1.95%-3.93%. Presences of phenolic contents indicate higher antioxidant potential of these honey samples. All bacteria showed clear inhibition zones in response to tested honey samples whereas fungi and yeast showed inhibition at higher concentrations of these honey samples. For Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeroginosa and Aspergillus niger, overall the small honey showed the higher activity than other honey samples. CONCLUSION: Physico-chemical analysis of honey samples confirmed good quality of honey according to the standards set by European Union Commission and Codex Alimentarius Commission. Evaluation of these honey samples confirms antimicrobial potential of particular types of honeys indigenous to Pakistan.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of Lavandula coronopifolia essential oil against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the composition of the essential oil (EO) of Lavandula coronopifolia from Morocco and to evaluate its in vitro antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from clinical infections. The antimicrobial activity was assessed by a broth micro-well dilution method using multiresistant clinical isolates of 11 pathogenic bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Hafnia alvei, Salmonella spp., Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The main compounds of the oil were carvacrol (48.9%), E-caryophyllene (10.8%) and caryophyllene oxide (7.7%). The oil showed activity against all tested strains with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging between 1% and 4%. For most of the strains, the MIC value was equivalent to the minimal bactericidal concentration value, indicating a clear bactericidal effect of L. coronopifolia EO.
TI  - Decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract of cultivated thyme: antioxidant and antibacterial activities, and phenolic characterisation.
AB  - Bioactivity of thyme has been described, but mostly related to its essential oils, while studies with aqueous extracts are scarce. Herein, the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract, as also their phenolic compounds, were evaluated and compared. Decoction showed the highest concentration of phenolic compounds (either phenolic acids or flavonoids), followed by infusion and hydroalcoholic extract. In general, the samples were effective against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter sakazakii) bacteria, with decoction presenting the most pronounced effect. This sample also displayed the highest radical scavenging activity and reducing power. Data obtained support the idea that compounds with strong antioxidant and antibacterial activities are also water-soluble. Furthermore, the use of thyme infusion and decoction, by both internal and external use, at recommended doses, is safe and no adverse reactions have been described.
TI  - Screening and characterisation of antimicrobial properties of semisynthetic betulin derivatives.
AB  - Betulin (lup-20(29)-ene-3beta, 28-diol) is a naturally occurring triterpene, which is found in substantial amounts from the outer bark of birch trees. A library of 51 structurally diverse semisynthetic betulin derivatives was screened against five bacterial strains, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and a fungal strain Candida albicans, using broth microdilution assays. Primary antimicrobial screening at 50 microM concentration led to the identification of five compounds showing antimicrobial properties (inhibition of growth by >70% against one or more microbial strains). According to the dose-response results, 28-O-(N-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (compound 5) was the most active, showing MIC90 of 6.25 microM against two Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis and S. aureus. However, the activity of this compound was affected by albumin binding, which was demonstrated by the loss of activity in a host-pathogen co-culture assay as well as in the antibacterial assay in the presence of increased concentration of albumin. Furthermore, the effects on mammalian cells were evaluated by cytotoxicity assessment on hepatocyte cell culture after 24 h exposure to the compounds. Betulinic aldehyde (18), betulin-28-oxime (31) and hetero cycloadduct with acetoxy groups at carbon atoms 3 and 28 and ethyl substituent at the triazolo ring (43) displayed cytotoxicity towards hepatocytes, with IC50 values of 47, 25 and 16 microM, respectively. The IC50 value for 28-O-(N-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (5) was 56 microM. The current study presents an insight into using betulin scaffold for developing derivatives with antibacterial potential, and furthermore the necessity of in-depth analysis of found actives through selectivity profiling and follow-up studies including in silico ADMET predictions.
TI  - Blood stream infections due to OXA-48-like carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae: treatment and survival.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood stream infections (BSIs) due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are associated with high hospital mortality rates and present a tremendous challenge to clinicians. The optimal treatment remains undefined. We aimed to investigate the risk factors for mortality and the correlation between different treatment modalities and outcomes. METHODS: The clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of a cohort of 36 patients with BSIs due to CRE were investigated and a retrospective nested case-control study of surviving and non-surviving patients was conducted. RESULTS: Fifty percent of the cases were male and the mean patient age was 54.9 +/- 15.8 years. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the etiological agent in 26 cases (72.2%), Escherichia coli in eight (22.2%), and Enterobacter aerogenes in two (5.5%). All strains were phenotypically positive for carbapenemase activity and all except two (one E. coli and one K. pneumoniae) yielded both blaOXA-48 carbapenemases and blaCTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in PCR products. The 14-day, 28-day, and all-cause in-hospital mortality rates were 41.6%, 50%, and 58.3%, respectively. The median time to death was 8 days (range 2-52 days). No significant differences were observed between survivors and non-survivors in terms of baseline characteristics, comorbid conditions, etiologies, or sources of bacteremia, however hematological malignancies (p=0.015) and prolonged neutropenia (p=0.044) were more common in non-survivors. Microbiological eradication and clinical response within 7 days were two major determinants of 28-day attributable mortality (p=0.001 and p=0.001, adjusted r(2)=0.845). Colistin-based dual combinations, and preferably triple combinations, were associated with significantly better outcomes when compared to non-colistin-based regimens (p<0.001). Time to active treatment had a significant effect on the course of infection (p=0.014). CONCLUSION: Earlier active treatment with colistin based regimens and microbiological and clinical response within 7 days are major predictors of survival in cases of BSIs due to CRE. Rectal screening offers the advantage of earlier recognition and prompt empirical treatment.
TI  - Effect of vitreoscilla hemoglobin and culture conditions on production of bacterial L-asparaginase, an oncolytic enzyme.
AB  - L-asparaginase is a widely used cancer chemotherapy enzyme. The source for the enzyme with this property is mainly bacterial and its synthesis is strongly regulated by oxygen. In this study, we utilized two recombinant systems: one carried the gene (vgb) for the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb), a protein of prokaryotic origin which confers a highly efficient oxygen uptake to its host and the other carried the L-asparaginase gene (ansB). The host bacteria were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of these three bacteria, all gram-negative, E. coli and its recombinant strain showed up to sevenfold higher L-asparaginase activity in lactose than in other carbon sources. Although, in this bacterium glycerol was the poorest source for L-asparaginase synthesis, it supported the highest biomass production. In glucose medium, L-asparaginase activity of E. aerogenes was about threefold higher than its vgb and ansB recombinants. ansB recombinant showed significantly higher enzyme levels than both host and vgb recombinants in glycerol and lactose media. In this bacterium, VHb/vgb clearly caused a decrease in the enzyme synthesis under all conditions. As seen for E. aerogens, glycerol was the most favorable carbon source for P. aeruginosa and its vgb strain in terms of both L-asparaginase synthesis and biomass production. The cultures grown in glycerol had more than two- and threefold biomass than in glucose and lactose, respectively, and up to elevenfold than in mannitol. Indeed, the highest biomass production for all bacteria and their recombinants was in glycerol. The VHb/vgb system is clearly advantageous for production of L-asparaginase in P. aeruginosa. The same, however, does not hold true for E. aerogenes.
TI  - Albiziaflavane A: a new flavane from Albizia ferruginea (Mimosoideae).
AB  - A new polyhydroxylated flavane (1) was identified from Albizia ferruginea (Mimosoideae) along with 4',7-dihydroxyflavan-3,4-diol (2), julibrosides A1-A3 (3-5). The structures of the compounds were established based on their NMR and mass spectrometric data in conjunction with those previously reported in the literature. Compounds 1 and 5 displayed moderate antibacterial activities.
TI  - Incidence rates of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in France: a prospective nationwide study in 2011-12.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine proportions and incidence rates of Enterobacteriaceae producing carbapenemase among those non-susceptible (NS) to carbapenems in France. METHODS: From November 2011 to April 2012, 71 laboratories recorded non-duplicate Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates NS to at least one carbapenem and the total number of isolates of the different species. Carbapenem MICs were determined by broth microdilution and the beta-lactamase content by DNA microarray. RESULTS: During the study period, the 71 laboratories identified 133 244 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, of which 846 (0.63%) were NS to at least one carbapenem. Carbapenem-NS isolates accounted for 0.07% (61/90 148) among Escherichia coli isolates, 1.1% (111/10 436) among Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8.2% (492/5971) among Enterobacter cloacae and 4.0% (84/2104) among Enterobacter aerogenes. Among the 541 available carbapenem-NS isolates, 222 (including 63 randomly selected E. cloacae) were further analysed after confirmation of carbapenem non-susceptibility. None of the Enterobacter spp. isolates produced carbapenemase. Among the other species, 28 isolates produced carbapenemases (22 OXA-48, 4 KPC and 2 NDM), accounting for an estimated proportion of carbapenemase-producing isolates of 0.08% for all species, 0.01% for E. coli and 0.27% for K. pneumoniae. The incidence-density rate in the participating hospitals was 0.0041 per 1000 hospital-days and the incidence rate was 0.0027 per 100 admissions. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence-density rate of carbapenemase-producing isolates per 1000 hospital-days was low and 30-fold lower than that of carbapenem-NS isolates (0.125) and almost 300-fold lower than that of ESBL-producing isolates (1.104) in these French hospitals.
TI  - Silver sucrose octasulfate (IASOS) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  - This in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of Sucrose Octasulfate (IASOS) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing IASOS (SilSOS Femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag+), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag+) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag+ versus 25 mg/L Ag+). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/L Ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS. Overall, our findings support IASOS as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.
TI  - [Our experience in Fournier's gangrene with severe septic shock].
AB  - Fournier's gangrene is a rare, rapidly progressing necrotizing fasciitis, which involves the genital area and perineum, progresses towards the thighs and abdominal wall through fascial plains. In our surgical department we treated seven patients with Fournier's gangrene between 2007 and 2011. Early diagnosis, immediate radical surgical debridement, necrosectomy, appropriate antibiotics and intensive care are all required and necessary for the successful treatment. Despite appropriate therapy, two patients were lost in septic shock.
TI  - Dissemination of bacterial fluoroquinolone resistance in two multidrug-resistant  enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials has become one of the greatest challenges  for clinical microbiologists and healthcare practitioners worldwide. Acquisition of resistance genes has proven to be difficult to characterize and is largely uncontrollable in the environment. Here we sought to characterize conjugal horizontal gene transfer of plasmid-encoded fluoroquinolone resistance genes from two strains of Enterobacteriaceae, one clinical and one from a municipal wastewater treatment plant environment. Conjugation was dissimilar between the two strains. Escherichia coli strain LR09, containing a plasmid with the aac(6')-Ib-cr fluoroquinolone resistance gene, did not conjugate with any of the 15 strains tested, while Enterobacter aerogenes strain YS11 conjugated with two strains of E. coli. The resultant transconjugants were also dissimilar in their stability and potential persistence. The observations presented herein exemplify the difficulties in understanding and controlling the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Thus, it may be prudent to address drug disposal and destruction, incorporating a life-cycle assessment plan 'from cradle to grave', treating antimicrobials as chemical or environmental contaminants.
TI  - A food additive with prebiotic properties of an alpha-d-glucan from lactobacillus plantarum DM5.
AB  - An alpha-d-glucan produced by Lactobacillus plantarum DM5 was explored for in vitro prebiotic activities. Glucan-DM5 demonstrated 21.6% solubility, 316.9% water holding capacity, 86.2% flocculation activity, 71.4% emulsification activity and a degradation temperature (Td) of 292.2 degrees C. Glucan-DM5 exhibited lowest digestibility of 0.54% by artificial gastric juice, 0.21% by intestinal fluid and 0.32% by alpha-amylase whereas the standard prebiotic inulin, showed 25.23%, 5.97% and 19.13%, hydrolysis, respectively. Prebiotic activity assay of glucan-DM5 displayed increased growth of probiotic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus, but did not support the growth of non-probiotic bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. The overall findings indicated that glucan from L. plantarum DM5 can serve as a potential prebiotic additive for food products.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility and distribution of beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae causing intra-abdominal infections in North America 2010-2011.
AB  - The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends has been monitoring the  activity of antimicrobials indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections since 2004. This report documents the in vitro activity of several recommended antimicrobials against 3449 gram-negative bacilli isolated from the 30 and 25 participating sites in North America in 2010-2011, respectively, and characterizes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) identified in ESBL-positive and ertapenem-non-susceptible isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morgannii were the most common species isolated. The incidence of beta-lactamase production was 8.8% and 8.9% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Overall the most active antimicrobials were amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, although beta-lactamase production reduced the activity of most agents. Characterization of beta-lactamase genes determined that bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(AmpC), and bla(KPC) were commonly found in most beta-lactamase-positive isolates.
TI  - Transport of nickel and cobalt ions into bacterial cells by S components of ECF transporters.
AB  - Energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters form a distinct group of ABC-type micronutrient importers in prokaryotes that do not contain extracytoplasmic, soluble substrate-binding proteins. Instead, they consist of a transmembrane substrate-specific S component that interacts with a module composed of a moderately conserved transmembrane (T) component and ABC ATPases. The majority of S components is considered to act as high-affinity binding proteins that strictly depend on their cognate T and ATPase units for transport activity. For a fraction of biotin-specific S units, however, transport activity was demonstrated in their solitary state. Here, we compared the activities of nickel- and cobalt-specific ECF transporters in the presence and absence of their T and ATPase units. Accumulation assays with radioactive metal ions showed that the truncated transporters led to approx. 25% of cell-bound radioactivity compared to the holotransporters. Activity of urease, an intracellular nickel-dependent enzyme, was used as a reporter and clearly indicated that the cell-bound radioactivity correlates with the cytoplasmic metal concentration. The results demonstrate that S units of metal transporters not only bind their substrates on the cell surface but mediate transport across the membrane, a finding of general importance on the way to understand the mechanism of ECF transporters.
TI  - Health evaluation and survey of zoonotic pathogens in free-ranging capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).
AB  - Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are the world's largest rodents and play an epidemiologic role in the transmission of zoonotic pathogens, including the causative agents of Brazilian spotted fever, leptospirosis, and others. We surveyed the health of 31 free-ranging capybaras at the Alberto Lofgren State Park, Sao Paulo, Brazil using a variety of diagnostic methods. Hematology and serum chemistry were consistent with mild malnutrition and parasitism but did not indicate severe physiologic imbalance or disease. All animals were serologically negative for Rickettsia rickettsii, Leishmania spp., and Trypanosoma sp., but antibodies against rabies virus (71%), Leptospira sp. (26%), and Toxoplasma sp. (23%) were detected. Salmonella sp. was not cultured from fecal samples. Frequently cultured enterobacteria included Escherichia coli (61%), Enterococcus casseiflavus (35%), Enterococcus faecalis (35%), Enterobacter aerogenes (32%), Klebisella pneumoniae (32%), and Serratia marcescens (32%). No potentially pathogenic fungi were cultured from hair samples. Fecal parasitology revealed infection by Protozoophaga sp. (58%), Viannella spp. (23%), Strongyloides spp. (10%), and Ancilostomatidae (10%). A total of 218 ticks was retrieved from the animals: Amblyomma sp. larvae and nymphs (43%), A. dubitatum adults (52%), and A. cajennense adults (5%). The capybaras were free from most potentially zoonotic pathogens evaluated; however, the presence of Amblyomma spp. ticks (potential vectors of Rickettsia spp.) and indirect evidence of exposure to the rabies virus, Leptospira sp., and Toxoplasma sp. warrant the maintenance of public health programs and wildlife health monitoring.
TI  - Microwave-assisted synthesis of diverse pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones and their antibacterial activities.
AB  - With the aim of developing a general and practical method for library production, a novel and efficient two-phase microwave-assisted cascade reaction between isatins and beta-ketoamides in [Bmim]BF4/toluene was developed for the synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones. The features of this methodology are, the use of microwave-assisted rapid synthesis, mild reaction conditions, high yields, operational simplicity, facile product separation, and recyclability. Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-dione derivatives produced were evaluated against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter aerogenes) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus). These derivatives showed antibacterial activities against Gram-positive strains that were at least equivalent to that against Gram-negative strains. Compound 7{3,5} displayed the most potent antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa (MIC = 0.5 mug/mL) and greater activity than standard ampicillin (MIC = 1 mug/mL). Compound 7{4,7} exhibited the best inhibitory activity against E. coli and E. aerogenes (MIC = 1 and 0.5 mug/mL), compared with the standard ampicillin (both MICs = 1 mug/mL). The synthesized pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones are expected to be widely used as lead compounds for the development of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, theoretical, anti-bacterial and molecular docking studies of quinoline based chalcones as a DNA gyrase inhibitor.
AB  - A series of fourteen (A1-A14) new qunioline based chalcones were synthesized by condensing 2,7-dichloro-8-methyl-3-formyl quinoline with acetophenone and acetylthiophenes, and subsequently characterized by IR, NMR and Mass spectroscopy. All the compounds were screened for antibacterial activities and found potentially active antibacterial agents. Bioassay, theoretical and dockings studies with DNA gyrase (the enzyme required for super coiling of DNA of bacteria) results showed that the type and positions of the substituents seemed to be critical for their antibacterial activities. The bromo and chloro substituted chalcone displayed high anti-bacterial activity. The A4 and A6 showed high interaction with DNA gyrase, contributing high free binding energy (DeltaG -8.18 and -8.88 kcal).
TI  - Molecular characterization of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in northern Portugal.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) prevalence was studied in the north of  Portugal, among 193 clinical isolates belonging to citizens in a district in the boundaries between this country and Spain from a total of 7529 clinical strains. In the present study we recovered some members of Enterobacteriaceae family, producing ESBL enzymes, including Escherichia coli (67.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30.6%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.5%), and Citrobacter freundii (0.5%). beta -lactamases genes blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing approaches. TEM enzymes were among the most prevalent types (40.9%) followed by CTX-M (37.3%) and SHV (23.3%). Among our sample of 193 ESBL-producing strains 99.0% were resistant to the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. Of the 193 isolates 81.3% presented transferable plasmids harboring bla ESBL genes. Clonal studies were performed by PCR for the enterobacterial repetitive intragenic consensus (ERIC) sequences. This study reports a high diversity of genetic patterns. Ten clusters were found for E. coli isolates and five clusters for K. pneumoniae strains by means of ERIC analysis. In conclusion, in this country, the most prevalent type is still the TEM-type, but CTX-M is growing rapidly.
TI  - Comparative genomic analysis of KPC-encoding pKpQIL-like plasmids and their distribution in New Jersey and New York Hospitals.
AB  - The global spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is predominately associated with K. pneumoniae strains genotyped as sequence type 258 (ST258). The first ST258-associated plasmid, pKpQIL, was described in Israel in 2006, but its history in the northeastern United States remains unknown. Six pKpQIL-like plasmids from four K. pneumoniae isolates (three ST258 and one ST234), one Escherichia coli isolate, and one Enterobacter aerogenes isolate, collected from 2003 to 2010 in New York (NY) and New Jersey (NJ) hospitals, were completely sequenced. The sequences and overall sizes of the six plasmids are highly similar to those of pKpQIL; the major difference is that five of six NJ/NY strains harbor blaKPC-2, while pKpQIL contains blaKPC-3. Moreover, a 26.7-kb fragment was inverted in pKpQIL-234 (from ST234 K. pneumoniae), while a 14.5-kb region was deleted in pKpQIL-Ec (from ST131 E. coli). PCR screening of 284 other clinical K. pneumoniae isolates identified 101 (35.6%) harboring pKpQIL-like plasmids from 9 of 10 surveyed hospitals, demonstrating the wide dissemination of pKpQIL in this region of endemicity. Among the positive isolates, 87.1% were typed as ST258 and 88.1% carried blaKPC-2. The finding of pKpQIL-like plasmid in this study from strains that predate the initial report of KPC in Israel provides evidence that pKpQIL may have originated in the United States. Our findings demonstrate that pKpQIL plasmids are both spreading clonally in ST258 strains and spreading horizontally to different sequence types and species, further highlighting the clinical and public health concerns associated with carbapenem resistance.
TI  - KPC-3 carbapenemase harbored in FIIk plasmid from Klebsiella pneumoniae ST512 and Escherichia coli ST43 in the same patient.
AB  - Five carbapenem-resistant strains (three Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Escherichia coli, and one Enterobacter aerogenes) were isolated between 2009 and 2012 at the Verona University Hospital, Italy, during an epidemiological analysis of antibiotic resistance determinants and plasmid profiles in Enterobacteriaceae. Two out of the five strains, K. pneumoniae E530 and E. coli E558, were cultured from bile and abdominal drainage, respectively, of a single patient. The strains were resistant to beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and susceptible to tigecycline and colistin. All the strains harboured bla(KPC-3), bla(TEM-1), and bla(OXA-9), and the three K. pneumoniae additionally carried blaSHV-11 and aac(6')Ib. The bla(KPC-3) was inserted in transposon Tn4401a. All the strains hosted an FIIk-type plasmid, and the three K. pneumoniae coharboured an colE-type plasmid. Transconjugants, besides bla(KPC-3), harboured bla(TEM-1) and bla(OXA-9) genes on FIIk-type plasmid. K. pneumoniae E301 was ST258, while strain E530 and C525 belonged to the ST512, and E. coli E558 was ST43. To our best knowledge, this is the first report that strongly supports the transmission of bla(KPC-3) from ST512 K. pneumoniae to E. coli ST43 in a single patient, a phenomenon of both clinical and microbiological importance.
TI  - In Vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 Indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by the Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. The antibacterial potentiality of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of nine uropathogens. RESULTS: Two Gram-positive isolates, E. faecalis and S. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. Gram-negative isolates A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. Methanolic leaf extracts of Anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against S. aureus and 28 mm against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for E. faecalis, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: C. tora > A. acuminata > Schleichera oleosa > Pterocarpus santalinus > Eugenia jambolana > Bridelia retusa > Mimusops elengi > Stereospermum kunthianum > Tectona grandis > Anthocephalus cadamba. The following eight plants had moderate control capacity: Artocarpus heterophyllus, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia latifolia, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gmelina arborea, Pongamia pinnata, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Shorea robusta. E. coli, followed by A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. Phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against MDR uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Efficacy of commercial natural antimicrobials alone and in combinations against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Microbial control strategies are needed in the food industry to prevent foodborne illnesses and outbreaks and prolong product shelf life. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of the commercial natural antimicrobials white mustard essential oil (WMEO), citrus flavonoid and acid blend (CFAB), olive extract (OE), Nisaplin (a compound containing nisin), and lauric arginate (LAE) alone and in combinations against foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. MICs of individual and combined antimicrobials against Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined at pH 6.0 and 25 degrees C. WMEO was most effective against B. cereus and S. aureus, with MICs of 250 and 500 mg/liter, respectively. CFAB inhibited all tested microorganisms, requiring only 12 to 35 mg/liter for gram-positive bacteria. For OE, 2,000 mg/liter was needed to achieve microbial inhibition. Nisaplin at 400 to 1,200 mg/liter inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. LAE was effective at low concentrations and required only 20 to 50 mg/liter to inhibit all tested microorganisms. When WMEO was combined with other antimicrobials, the effects were usually additive except for WMEO plus Nisaplin and WMEO+OE, which had synergistic activity against L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis, respectively. An antagonistic effect was observed for WMEO+CFAB against E. aerogenes. For WMEO+LAE+CFAB, additive antimicrobial effects were noted against all strains tested except S. aureus, where a synergistic effect occurred. These findings suggest that these commercial natural antimicrobials have potential to enhance food safety by inhibiting foodborne pathogens and extending product shelf life.
TI  - Emergence of Carbapenemaseproducing Klebsiella Pneumoniae of Sequence type 258 in Michigan, USA.
AB  - The prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in our hospital increased beginning in 2009. We aimed to study the clinical and molecular epidemiology of these emerging isolates. We performed a retrospective review of all adult patients with clinical cultures confirmed as CPE by positive modified Hodge test from 5/2009- 5/2010 at the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS). Clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. Available CPE isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA encoding gene and bla KPC locus. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to characterize Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Twenty six unique CPE isolates were obtained from 25 adult patients. The majority were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=17). Other isolates included K. oxytoca (n=3), Citrobacter freundii (n=2), Enterobacter cloacae (n=2), Enterobacter aerogenes (n=1) and Escherichia coli (n=1). Molecular characterization of 19 available CPE isolates showed that 13 (68%) carried the KPC-3 allele and 6 (32%) carried the KPC-2 allele. Among 14 available K. pneumoniae strains, 12 (86%) carried the KPC-3 allele and belonged to a common lineage, sequence type (ST) 258. The other 2 (14%) K. pneumoniae isolates carried the KPC-2 allele and belonged to two unique STs. Among these ST 258 strains, 67% were isolated from patients with prior exposures to health care settings outside of our institution. In contrast, all CPE isolates carrying the KPC-2 allele and all non ST 258 CPE isolates had acquisition attributable to our hospital. Molecular epidemiology of carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae suggests that KPC-3 producing K. pneumoniae isolates of a common lineage, sequence type (ST 258), are emerging in our hospital. While ST 258 is a dominant sequence type throughout the United States, this study is the first to report its presence in Michigan.
TI  - Characterization of KPC-2-producing Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates from a Chinese Hospital.
AB  - Twelve nonduplicated KPC-2-producing enterobacterial isolates, including three Escherichia coli, two Citrobacter freundii, two Enterobacter cloacae, four Enterobacter aerogenes, and one Klebsiella oxytoca, were collected from various clinical samples within 18 months (March 2011 to September 2012). Two of the 12 patients died from infections caused by KPC-2-producing pathogens, while the rest of the patients with KPC-2-producing pathogens improved or were cured. The majority of the clinical isolates exhibited a high-level of resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and carbapenems, and possessed self-transferable bla(KPC-2)-carrying plasmids with sizes ranging from 20 to 120 kb. Most isolates carried bla(CTX-M) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, while some isolates produced 16S rRNA methylases (ArmA or RmtB). The genetic environment of bla(KPC-2) of most clinical strains was consistent with the genetic structure surrounding bla(KPC-2) on the plasmid pKP048, which contains an integration structure of a Tn3-based transposon and partial Tn4401 segment. Inserted fragments (truncated bla(TEM)) were detected upstream of the bla(KPC-2) gene for two E. aerogenes strains. In conclusion, the enterobacterial isolates exhibited sporadic emergence and did not arise by clonal spread at our hospital. The outcome of infections caused by KPC-producing enterobacterial isolates and their mortality were closely associated with the baseline condition of patients. The spread of bla(KPC-2) gene between different enterobacterial species in China was mainly mediated by horizontal transfer of the Tn3-based transposons and not the bla(KPC-2)-carrying plasmids.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, mode of action and antibacterial activities of selected Saudi Arabian medicinal plants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The flora of Saudi Arabia is one of the richest biodiversity areas in the Arabian Peninsula and comprises very important genetic resources of crop and medicinal plants. The present study was designed to investigate the cytotoxicity and the antibacterial activities of the organic extracts from twenty six Saudi Arabian medicinal plants. The study was also extended to the investigation of the effects of the extracts from the four best plants, Ononis serrata (SY160), Haplophyllum tuberculatum (SY177), Pulicaria crispa (SY179), and Achillea beiberstenii (SY-200) on cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, caspases activities and mitochondrial function in leukemia CCRF-CEM cell line. METHODS: A resazurin assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of the extracts on a panel of human cancer cell lines whilst the microbroth dilution was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the samples against twelve bacterial strains belonging to four species, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: The best activity on leukemia cell lines were recorded with SY177 (IC50 of 9.94 mug/mL) and SY179 (IC50 of 1.81 mug/mL) against CCRF-CEM as well as Ach-b (IC50 of 9.30 mug/mL) and SY160 (IC50 of 5.06 mug/mL) against HL60 cells. The extracts from SY177 and SY179 were also toxic against the seven solid cancer cell lines studied with the highest IC50 values of 31.64 mug/mL (SY177 against Hep-G2 cells). SY177 and Ach-b induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 and S phases whilst SY160 and SY179 induced arrest in G0/G1 phase. All the four plant extracts induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells with the alteration of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In the antibacterial assays, only Ach-b displayed moderate antibacterial activities against E. coli and E. aerogenes ATCC strains (MIC of 256 mug/mL), AG100A(TeT) and K. pneumoniae ATCC strains (MIC of 128 mug/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Finally, the results of the present investigation provided supportive data for the possible use of some Saudi Arabian plants investigated herein, and mostly Haplophyllum tuberculatum, Pulicaria crispa, Ononis serrata and Achillea beiberstenii in the control of cancer diseases.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - KPC-2 carbapenemase and DHA-1 AmpC determinants carried on the same plasmid in Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - This study was conducted to analyse the presence of a plasmid-mediated carbapenem resistance mechanism in a clinical Enterobacter aerogenes isolate from a patient from Jiangsu province, People's Republic of China. PCR and sequencing confirmed that the isolate harboured Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-2, DHA-1 and TEM-1 beta-lactamase genes. Both the KPC-2 and DHA-1 genes were transferred to Escherichia coli C600 by transconjugation, and Southern blotting confirmed that these two genes were located on the same plasmid, which was of approximately 56 kb in size. The Enterobacter aerogenes isolate was resistant to carbapenems and other tested antimicrobial agents. The Escherichia coli transconjugant showed reduced susceptibility but not resistance to carbapenems and other beta-lactams, indicating the presence of another, possibly permeability-related, resistance mechanism in the clinical isolate.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy and phytochemical analysis of Indigofera trita Linn.
AB  - An in vitro antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of various extracts of Indigofera trita L. viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts were carried out. A total of 21 microorganisms (19 bacteria and 2 fungal strains) were used for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion method and a standard procedure was used to identify the phytochemical constituents. Petroleum ether extract showed moderate inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (14.40 mm), S. epidermidis (14.20 mm), Salmonella paratyphi A (12.80 mm), Streptococcus mutans (12.20 mm), Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, S. typhi and Burkholderia cepacia (12.00 mm). The chloroform extract also showed antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis (14.20 mm), S. typhimurium (12.60 mm), S. paratyphi A, S. brunei and Yersinia enterocolitica (12.00 mm). The acetone extract of I. trita showed considerable inhibitory activity against S. epidermidis (18.20 mm), S. typhimurium (14.60 mm), S. infantis (13.80 mm), S. aureus (13.40 mm), Y. enterocolitica (13.00 mm) and Enterobacter aerogenes (12.00 mm) were documented. Ethanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis (18.60 mm), S. paratyphi A (14.60 mm), Y. enterocolitica (13.40 mm), S. typhi (12.40 mm), S. aureus, E. aerogenes, S. typhimurium and S. infantis (12.00 mm). Aqueous extract of I. trita considerably inhibited S. epidermidis (13.80 mm), S. paratyphi A and Y. enterocolitica (12.20 mm), E. aerogenes and Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (12.00 mm). All the five extracts showed a minimal antifungal activity when compared to antibacterial activity. The result revealed that the antimicrobial properties of I. trita might be associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols and alkaloids.
TI  - Avibactam reverts the ceftazidime MIC90 of European Gram-negative bacterial clinical isolates to the epidemiological cut-off value.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ceftazidime-avibactam consists of the beta-lactam ceftazidime and the novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam. The effect of avibactam on the ceftazidime MIC frequency distribution of Gram-negative European clinical isolates was observed and compared to European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) MIC frequency distributions and epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) listed for ceftazidime. METHODS: Ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam MICs were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference broth microdilution methods for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Enterobacter spp., and Proteus mirabilis isolates collected from medical centres in Europe during 2009. RESULTS: The MIC(90) values for ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam against P. aeruginosa isolates from a 2009 European surveillance programme were >32 and 8 mg/l, respectively. That is, the presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime MIC(90) for P. aeruginosa to the ECOFF. Similarly, the MIC(90) values for ceftazidime against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., and P. mirabilis were also reduced to the ECOFF by the presence of avibactam. Avibactam reduced the ceftazidime MIC(90) value against collected Enterobacter spp. to 1 mg/l (>32-fold reduction). No ECOFF has been defined for Enterobacter spp. however, it is 1 mg/l for Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime MIC(90) for Gram-negative bacteria to the ECOFF.
TI  - The presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  - Mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (ET). It is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of VAP. Unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time VAP is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (SC). It is thus important to know whether these SC can predict the microbial flora in ET biofilms. In this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and of Candida albicans in cultures from ET biofilms and SC (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. Our data indicate that there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in ET biofilms and SC.
TI  - [The risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in newborn and the changes of isolated pathogens].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in  newborn and the profiles of isolated pathogens. METHODS: The clinical data of 179 neonates in the previous group (from December 2005 to December 2008) and 331 neonates in the present group (from January 2009 to January 2012) admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and received mechanical ventilation for equal or longer than 48 hours were respectively reviewed and analyzed,and their isolated pathogen profile and drug sensitivity were also compared in two groups. RESULTS: The incidence of VAP in the previous group and the present group were 22.35% and 20.24% respectively, no significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05) was observed. Gram-negative bacteria was the main pathogens (93.40%), the first 5 common pathogens in the previous group were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. However, the first 5 of isolated gram-negative pathogens in the present group were somewhat different from the previous group, which were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. The drug sensitivity test showed that these pathogens had a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics, of which the carbapenem antibiotic drug sensitivity decreased significantly, there was statistically significant difference between the previous group and the present group (P < 0.05). The risk factors of VAP include the duration of mechanical ventilation (OR = 5.680, 95% CI: 2.867-11.253), the frequency of tracheal intubation (OR = 2.219, 95% CI: 1.037- 4.748), birth weight (OR = 2. 127, 95% CI: 1.067-4.238) and neonatal asphyxia (OR = 2.025, 95% CI: 1.079-3.799) as well as the duration of hospital stay (OR = 2.012, 95% CI: 1.215-3.967). CONCLUSIONS: According to the data in our hospital, the main pathogenic bacteria of VAP were gram-negative pathogens, which showed a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics. The incidence of VAP was closely related to the duration of mechanical ventilation, the frequency of intubation, birth weight and the hospitalization as well as the neonatal asphyxia.
TI  - Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA and parC in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Brazil.
AB  - Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) in chromosomal gyrA and parC genes and fluoroquinolone susceptibility profiles were investigated in quinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from community and hospitalized patients in the Brazilian Southeast region. A total of 112 nalidixic acid-resistant enterobacterial isolates collected from 2000 to 2005 were investigated for mutations in the topoisomerases genes gyrA and parC by amplifying and sequencing the QRDR regions. Susceptibility to fluoroquinolones was tested by the agar dilution method. Amongst the 112 enterobacterial isolates, 81 (72.3%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 5 (4.5%) showed reduced susceptibility. Twenty-six (23.2%) were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Several alterations were detected in gyrA and parC genes. Escherichia coli isolates (47.7%) showed double mutations in the gyrA gene and a single one in the parC gene. Two unusual aminoacid substitutions are reported, an Asp87-Asn in a Citrobacter freundii isolate with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and a Glu84-Ala in one E. coli isolate. Only a parC gene mutation was found in fluoroquinolone-susceptible Enterobacter aerogenes. None of the isolates susceptible to ciprofloxacin presented mutations in topoisomerase genes. This comprehensive analysis of QRDRs in gyrA and parC genes, covering commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae in Brazil is the largest reported up to now.
TI  - A comparative study on phosphotransferase activity of acid phosphatases from Raoultella planticola and Enterobacter aerogenes on nucleosides, sugars, and related compounds.
AB  - Natural and modified nucleoside-5'-monophosphates and their precursors are valuable compounds widely used in biochemical studies. Bacterial nonspecific acid phosphatases (NSAPs) are a group of enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of phosphoester bonds, and some of them exhibit phosphotransferase activity. NSAP containing Enterobacter aerogenes and Raoultella planticola whole cells were evaluated in the phosphorylation of a wide range of nucleosides and nucleoside precursors using pyrophosphate as phosphate donor. To increase the productivity of the process, we developed two genetically modified strains of Escherichia coli which overexpressed NSAPs of E. aerogenes and R. planticola. These new recombinant microorganisms (E. coli BL21 pET22b-phoEa and E. coli BL21 pET22b-phoRp) showed higher activity than the corresponding wild-type strains. Reductions in the reaction times from 21 h to 60 min, from 4 h to 15 min, and from 24 h to 40 min in cases of dihydroxyacetone, inosine, and fludarabine, respectively, were obtained.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Culture proven newborn sepsis with a special emphasis on late onset sepsis caused by Enterobacteriaceae in a level III neonatal care unit in Astana, Kazakhstan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Newborn sepsis is one of the major public health concerns worldwide.  Also in our neonatal care unit, it is one of the major problems and especially infections with Enterobacteriaceae were noted to pose an increasing problem in the last years. METHODS: Data collection was done retrospectively for 2011. Early onset sepsis was defined as having a positive blood culture within 72 h and late onset sepsis after 72 h of delivery. RESULTS: Out of 599 patients being admitted, 58 newborns were assessed having a neonatal sepsis. Of these 58 newborns with sepsis, 11 were diagnosed within 72 h post delivery (early onset) and 47 were diagnosed after 72 h post delivery (late onset). The percentage of Enterobacteriaceae causing late onset sepsis was 57.5 %. Among these, Klebsiella pneumoniae could be isolated in 29.8 %, Enterobacter cloacae in 12.8 %, Enterobacter aerogenes in 8.5 %, and Escherichia coli in 6.4 % of late onset sepsis. Majority of the strains showed a resistance to antibiotics used in empiric treatment. Antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment from birth until the onset of late onset sepsis could be analyzed in 20 out of 27 newborns with late onset sepsis caused by Enterobacteriaceae. A regimen of empirical antibiotic treatment containing aminopenicillin and/or gentamicin was administered in 16 newborns and that of cephalosporin in 14 out of 20 newborns for at least 5 days before onset of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: The association of empiric long-term antibiotic treatment and the high number of late onset sepsis with often multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae might be causal and urges for a change in general antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment in newborns admitted to the neonatal care unit of our hospital.
TI  - Enhancement of extracellular pullulanase production from recombinant Escherichia  coli by combined strategy involving auto-induction and temperature control.
AB  - Pullulanase was extracellularly produced with an engineered Escherichia coli with a combined strategy. When auto-induction instead of isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction method was implemented, we observed increased extracellular activity (4.2 U ml(-1)) and cell biomass (7.95 g DCW l(-1)). Subsequent investigation of temperature effect on fermentation showed cultivation performed at 25 degrees C presented the highest extracellular titer and cell biomass. In order to reduce the extended production period, we developed a two-stage temperature control strategy. Its application not only reduced the production period from 72 to 36 h, but also further enhanced the yield of extracellular pullulanase. Finally, with a view to releasing more intracellular pullulanase, we altered cell membrane permeability with various medium additives. As a result, extracellular titer was elevated to 68.23 U ml(-1), nearly 35-fold higher than that with IPTG induction method. The combined strategy developed here may be useful for the production of other extracellular proteins by recombinant E. coli.
TI  - Assessment of phytochemicals, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of extract and fractions from Fagonia olivieri (Zygophyllaceae).
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Pakistan Fagonia olivieri (Zygophyllaceae) is commonly used in the indigenous system of medicine for treatment of conditions like diabetes, cancer, fever, asthma, toothache, stomach troubles and kidney disorders. This study evaluated the crude methanol extract of F. olivieri (FOM) and its derived fractions for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities as well as the classes of phytochemical. METHODS: Dried powder of whole plant of F. olivieri was extracted with methanol (FOM) and the resultant was fractionated to give n-hexane fraction (FOH), chloroform fraction (FOC), ethyl acetate fraction (FOE), n-butanol fraction (FOB) and residual aqueous fraction (FOA). Methanol extract and its derived fractions were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. Also the extract and fractions were assayed for antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities using agar well diffusion technique, agar tube dilution method and brine shrimps lethality test, respectively. RESULTS: The results obtained for phytochemical analysis indicate the presence of saponins and alkaloids in all the tested extract and fractions while anthraquinones were not detected. The results showed that all the bacterial strains tested in this study were susceptible to at least one of the fractions tested. However, FOE and FOB were the best antibacterial fractions and showed antibacterial activity against maximum number of bacterial strains. The results showed that Escherichia coli was the most sensitive bacterium while Bordetella bronchiseptica and Enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible against various fractions. Maximum percent inhibition for growth was recorded for the fungus Aspergillus flavus with FOE whereas growth of Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium solani was inhibited by FOM and its all derived fractions. Minimum LC50 (24.07 mg/L) for brine shrimp assay was recorded for FOE followed by LC50 of FOC (26.1 mg/L) and FOB (30.05 mg/L) whereas maximum LC50 was exhibited by FOH (1533 mg/L). CONCLUSION: These results indicated the use of F. olivieri to treat infections with emphasis to isolate and characterize the active principle responsible for antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities and its exploitation as therapeutic agent.
TI  - Development of glycerol-utilizing Escherichia coli strain for the production of bioethanol.
AB  - The production of bioethanol was studied using recombinant Escherichia coli with  glycerol as a carbon source. Glycerol is an attractive feedstock for biofuels production since it is generated as a major byproduct in biodiesel industry; therefore, we investigated the conversion of glycerol to bioethanol using E. coli BL21 (DE3) which harbors several genes in ethanol production pathway of Enterobacter aerogenes KCTC 2190. Fermentation was carried out at 34 degrees C for 42h, pH 7.6, using defined production medium. Under optimal conditions, bioethanol production by the recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3), strain pEB, was two-fold (3.01g/L) greater than that (1.45g/L) by the wild-type counterpart. The results obtained in this study will provide valuable guidelines for engineering bioethanol producers.
TI  - Acanthamoeba castellanii of the T4 genotype is a potential environmental host for Enterobacter aerogenes and Aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acanthamoeba can interact with a wide range of microorganisms such as viruses, algae, yeasts, protists and bacteria including Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Helicobacter pylori, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium spp., and Escherichia coli. In this capacity, Acanthamoeba has been suggested as a vector in the transmission of bacterial pathogens to the susceptible hosts. METHODS: Here, we used a keratitis isolate of A. castellanii of the T4 genotype and studied its interactions with two bacterial genera which have not been tested before, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Aeromonas hydrophila, as well as E. coli. Assays were performed to determine bacterial association with and invasion of A. castellanii. Additionally, bacterial survival intracellular of A. castellanii trophozoites as well as cysts was determined. RESULTS: All three bacterial isolates tested, associated, invaded, and survived inside A. castellanii trophozoites as well as A. castellanii cysts. However, E. aerogenes and E. coli exhibited significantly reduced association with and invasion of A. castellanii as compared with A. hydrophila (P < 0.01 using paired T-test, one tail distribution). In the long term survival assays, all three bacterial isolates tested remained viable inside A. castellanii trophozoites, while amoeba remained intact; however A. hydrophila exhibited higher survival inside amoebae (14.54 +/- 3.3 bacteria:amoeba ratio) compared with E. aerogenes (3.96 +/- 0.7 bacteria:amoeba ratio) and E. coli (5.85 +/- 1.1 bacteria:amoeba ratio). A. hydrophila, E. coli, and E. aerogenes remained viable during the encystment process and exhibited higher levels of recovery from mature cysts (14.13 +/- 0.89 A. hydrophila:amoeba ratio, 10.13 +/- 1.17 E. aerogenes:amoeba ratio, and 11.95 +/- 0.7 E. coli:amoeba ratio). CONCLUSIONS: A. hydrophila and E. aerogenes also joined the ranks of other bacteria that could benefit from A. castellanii. Because cysts can be airborne, these findings suggest that Acanthamoeba is a potential vector in the transmission of A. hydrophila and E. aerogenes to susceptible hosts.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing multidrug resistant urinary isolates from children visiting Kathmandu Model Hospital.
AB  - A study was conducted to analyze the status of the multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates producing Extended Spectrum of beta-lactamase (ESBL) among the uropathogens infecting children less than 15 years from November 2010 to April 2011 in the Bacteriology laboratory, Kathmandu Model Hospital. Urine samples received in the laboratory were processed for routine culture. The antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates was determined following Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) recommended Kirby-Bauer Disc Diffusion method. The defining criterion in this study for an isolate to be multidrug resistant was resistance to two or more drugs of different structural classes. Isolates were confirmed for ESBL-production by performing the Inhibitor Potentiated Disk Diffusion (IPDD) Test/ Combined Disk Assay for ESBL confirmation. Out of 252 urine samples received in the laboratory, 59(23.41%) showed significant growth of which 54.23% (32/59) were MDR isolates. Additionally, 25 isolates (21 Escherichia coli and 3 Citrobacter freundii and single Enterobacter aerogenes) among them were ESBL producers. Among the first line drugs used against gram negative isolates, Nitrofurantoin was drug of choice; meanwhile among the second line drugs Cefoperazone/Sulbactum was drug of choice, whereas, Cephotaxime, Ciprofloxacin, Norfloxacin and Gentamicin were the drug of choice for Gram positive isolates. Significant association was found between ESBL production and spectrum of drug resistance (p < 0.05).
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. In majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. Thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. This study was designed to find out the etiological agents of UTI and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. This study was conducted in Kathmandu Model Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from April to October, 2009. Midstream Urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of UTI were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS software window version 16. The overall prevalence of UTI was found to be 18.89%. The most frequent causative organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (82.30%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), Citrobacter freundii (3.60%), Enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (2.40%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), Proteus mirabilis (0.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). Nitrofurantoin and Amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. E. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of UTI and Nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.
TI  - Design and Evaluation of Novel Antimicrobial and Anticancer Agents Among Tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline-5-thione S-Derivatives.
AB  - The novel heterocyclization of 5-(2-aminophenyl)-1H-tetrazole with potassium ethylxanthogenate or carbon disulfide was proposed. The potassium salt of the tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline-5-thione was subsequently modified by alkylation with proper halogen derivatives to (tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-ylthio)alkyls, N,N-dialkylethylamines, 1-aryl-2-ethanones, 1-(alkyl)aryl-2-ethanols, carboxylic acids, and esters. The structures of all newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by FT-IR, UV-vis, LC-MS, (1)H, (13)C NMR, and elemental analysis data. The substances were screened for antibacterial and antifungal activities (100 mug) against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Entrococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Preliminary bioluminescence inhibition tests against Photobacterium leiognathi Sh1 showed that substances 5.2-5.4, 6.1, 7.1 with ethanone or carboxylic acid substituents showed toxicity against bacteria cells. The substances chosen by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) were screened for their ability to inhibit 60 different human tumor cell lines, where 2-(tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-ylthio)-1-(4-tolyl)ethanone (5.2), 3-(tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-ylthio)propanoic and related 3-metyl-butanoic acids (6.2, 6.3), and ethyl tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-ylthio)acetate (7.2) showed lethal antitumor activity (1.0 muM) against the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (CCRF-CEM), and substances 5.2 and 6.3 exhibited moderate anticancer properties inhibiting growth of the leukemia MOLT-4 and HL06-(TB) cell lines. The moderate antitumor activity was demonstrated in 1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-ylthio)ethanone (5.4) against the CNS cancer cell line SNB-75. Comparing the docking mode of the Gefitinib and synthesised substances on the ATP binding site of EGFR, it could be assumed that these compounds might act in the same way. The results of the investigation could be considered as a useful base for future development of potent antimicrobials and antitumor agents among tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline-5-thione S-derivatives.
TI  - [Investigation of the presence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) by PCR in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates].
AB  - Bacteria producing New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. This broad-spectrum resistance limits treatment options for infections caused by NDM-1 producers. NDM-1 was first isolated from an Indian patient in Sweden; since then, NDM-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including Turkey. In this study, we investigated the presence of NDM-1 by PCR method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in Samsun, Turkey. A total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 Acinetobacter baumannii, 54 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 Pseudomonas putida, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 3 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia rettgeri, 2 Escherichia coli and 1 Citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. Identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using Vitek-2 Compact (bioMerieux, France) and BD Phoenix (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD) automated systems. The results of antibiotic susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the CLSI recommendations. In our study, NDM-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by PCR. There was only one case study that reported the presence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates from Turkey [Poirel L et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2012;56:2784]. Our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates is not common in Turkey. However, since NDM-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. Therefore, continuous surveillance and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of NDM-1 may enable to identify NDM-1 producing isolates. Meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of NDM-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some actinomycetes from Tamil Nadu, India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate novel actinomycetes and to evaluate their antibacterial activity. METHODS: Three soil samples were collected from Vengodu (village) in Kanchipuram district, Tamil Nadu, India. Actinomycetes were isolated using serial dilution and plating method on actinomycetes isolation agar. RESULTS: Totally 35 isolates were obtained on the basis of colony characteristics on actinomycetes isolation agar. All the isolates were screened for antibacterial activity by cross streak method. Medium and optimization of day were done for the potent strains using Nathan's agar well diffusion method. Isolation of bioactive compounds from significant active isolates was done by using different media. The most active isolate VAS 10 was identified as Actinobacterium Loyola PBT VAS 10 (accession No. JF501398) using 16s rRNA sequence method. The hexane, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and butanol extracts of VAS 10 were tested against bacteria. The maximum antibacterial activity was observed in dichloromethane and ethyl acetate; maximum zones of inhibition were observed against Enterococcus durans. The rRNA secondary structure and the restriction sites of Actinobacterium Loyola VAS 10 were predicted using Genebee and NEBCutter online tools respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that among the isolated actinomycetes, Actinobacterium Loyola PBT VAS 10 (accession No. JF501398) showed good antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria.
TI  - Distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the Asia-Pacific region: results of the study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART).
AB  - The increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the Asia-Pacific region were investigated. Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex PCR. A total of 699 Enterobacteriaceae isolates with positive genotypic results, included Escherichia coli (n = 443), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), Citrobacter freundii (n = 5), Proteus mirabilis (n = 3), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), Morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of Enterobacter asburiae, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri were analyzed. Nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated IAI. CTX-M (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with CTX-M-15) was the most common ESBL, followed by SHV (n = 59) and TEM (n = 4). CMY (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with CMY-2) was the most common AmpC beta-lactamase, followed by DHA (n = 46) and ACT/MIR (n = 40). NDM (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with NDM-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by IMP (n = 7) and OXA (n = 7). Isolates from hospital-associated IAI had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. Carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from India, except that IMP beta-lactamases were also detected in Philippines and Australia. CTX-M beta-lactamases were the predominant ESBLs produced by Enterobacteriaceae causing IAI in the Asia-Pacific region. Emergence of CTX-M-15-, CMY-2-, and NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of acute prostatitis after transrectal prostate biopsy.
AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to identify microbiological characteristics in patients with acute prostatitis after transrectal prostate biopsy to provide guidance in the review of prevention and treatment protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical records was performed in 1,814 cases who underwent prostate biopsy at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital over a 5 year period from 2006 to 2011. Cases in which acute prostatitis occurred within 7 days after the biopsy were investigated. Before starting treatment with antibiotics, sample collections were done for culture of urine and blood. Culture and drug susceptibility was identified by use of a method established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: A total of 1,814 biopsy procedures were performed in 1,541 patients. For 1,246 patients, the procedure was the first biopsy, whereas for 295 patients it was a repeat biopsy. Twenty-one patients (1.36%) were identified as having acute bacterial prostatitis after the biopsy. Fifteen patients (1.2%) had acute prostatitis after the first biopsy, and 6 patients (2.03%) experienced acute prostatitis after a repeat biopsy. Even though the incidence of acute bacterial prostatitis was higher after repeat biopsy than that after the first biopsy, there was no statistically significant intergroup difference in terms of incidence (chi(2)=1.223, p=0.269). When the collected urine and blood samples were cultured, Escherichia coli was found in samples from 15 patients (71.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae in 3 patients (14.3%), Enterobacter intermedius in 1 patient (4.8%), E. aerogenes in 1 patient (4.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1 patient (4.8%). A fluoroquinolone-resistant strain was confirmed in 5 cases (23.8%) in total. Three cases of E. coli and 1 case of Klebsiella had extended-spectrum beta-lactamase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical treatment of acute prostatitis should be done with consideration of geographical prevalence and drug resistance. This study will provide meaningful information for the management of acute prostatitis after transrectal prostate biopsy.
TI  - Urinary tract infection among symptomatic outpatients visiting a tertiary hospital based in midwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Microbial pathogens implicated in urinary tract infection and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns as prevalent in UTI symptomatic outpatients resident in Benin City, Nigeria was the focus of this study. One hundred (100) midstream urine samples were collected into sterile plastic universal bottles from outpatients who visited the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria and who were tentatively diagnosed as manifesting symptoms of UTI. Patients were referred to the Medical Microbiology department by the consulting doctors. Significant bacterial counts and neutrophil (pus cells) counts were carried out on samples by standard methods. Positive samples for both counts were inoculated aseptically on sterile MacConkey agar, Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient (CLED) agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar plates and incubated appropriately. Microbial isolates were identified and antibiotic sensitivity testing was carried out on isolates by standard methods. Thirty nine (39.0%) and 61 (61.0%) samples recorded significant microbial growth and no growth respectively. Gram negative bacilli constituted 86.1% (of which enterobacteriaceae made up 49.9%) while gram positive cocci made up 13.9%. Strains of uropathogens isolated were Alcaligenes spp (19.4%), Klebsiella aerogenes (16.7%), Escherichia coli (13.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.9%), Candida albicans (11.1%), Proteus mirabilis (8.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.5%), Enterobacter spp (5.5%) and Providencia spp (5.5%). Occurrence of UTI in male and female patients were 58.3% and 41.7% respectively of which UTI occurred highest in the 25-46, 15-54 and 27-54 age groups in that decreasing order. Alcaligenes spp occurred most in very old female patients. Candida albicans (the only fungal uropathogen) occurred in an 8day old male patient. Other isolates occurred in much older patients. A significantly high microscopic neutrophil count or pyuria was recorded from deposits of UTI positive patients (i.e. &lt; 5/HPF). Eighteen (representing 50.5%) and 15 (47.8%) of total microbial strains isolated were sensitive to nitrofurantoin and ceftriaxone respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility profile also showed 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%) for ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime and ofloxacin respectively suggesting moderate sensitivity of the fluoroquinolones and second/third generation cephalosporins. Gentamicin, ampicillin and augmentin recorded over 70.0% resistance level each. A total of nineteen bacterial strains made of E.coli, Enterobacter spp, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp, Staph. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were multi drug resistant as they resisted 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 and 8 antibiotics respectively.
TI  - In vitro Studies of Antimicrobial Activity of Crude Extracts of the Indian Grasses Dhaman (Cenchrus ciliaris) and Kala-Dhaman (Cenchrus setigerus).
AB  - The aim of present study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of Cenchrus ciliaris and Cenchrus setigerus extracts in order to use it as a possible source for new antimicrobial substances against important human pathogens. Crude extracts of the stem of Cenchrus ciliaris and Cenchrus setigerus were evaluated against some medically important pathogens viz. Escherichia coli, Raoultella planticola, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus. The dried and powdered stems were successively extracted with hexane, toluene, isopropyl alcohol, acetone and ethanol using soxhlet assembly. The antimicrobial activity assay was done by both disc diffusion and serial dilution methods. Isopropyl alcohol extract of Cenchrus setigerus showed highest activity against Escherichia coli. The test pathogens were more sensitive to the isopropyl alcohol, acetone and ethanol extracts than to the hexane and toluene extracts except against Bacillus subtilis. Result reveals that the most bioactive compound was cycloleucolenol-9,19-cycloergost-24 (28)-en-3-ol, 4, 14-dimethyl acetate in both the species of Cenchrus grass, (19.15%) in isopropanol extract of Cenchrus setigerus whereas, (14.03%) in acetone extract of Cenchrus ciliaris.
TI  - New pyran-2-ones from alkalophilic actinomycete, Nocardiopsis alkaliphila sp. Nov. YIM-80379.
AB  - Two new pyran-2-ones, nocardiopyrones A and B (1 and 2, resp.), along with four known compounds, pyridinols 3-5, and 1-acetyl-beta-carboline (6) were isolated from the alkalophilic actinomycete Nocardiopsis alkaliphila sp. nov. YIM-80379. Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic analysis, CD spectra, and the quantum-chemical ECD calculation. Pyridinols 3-5 were isolated from a natural source for the first time. Compounds 1 and 2 showed weak antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli with MIC values of 20-48 muM. Compound 2 showed weak antimicrobial activities against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 24 and 48 muM, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial isothiocyanates from the seeds of Moringa oleifera Lam.
AB  - 4-(alpha-L-Rhamnosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate (1) and 4-(4'-O-acetyl-alpha-L-rhamnosyloxy)-benzyl isothiocyanate (2) isolated from Moringa oleifera seeds were screened for their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for their antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, and Epidermophyton floccosum using the disk diffusion method. Isothiocyanates 1 and 2 were found active at the lowest inhibitory concentration of 1 mg/ml against all Gram-positive bacteria tested (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis) and against the dermatophytic fungi E. floccosum and T. rubrum. Statistically significant differences were found between the mean inhibition zones (IZ) of 1 and 2 and the standard drugs, ofloxacin and clotrimazole. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values confirmed the good antimicrobial activity of 1 and 2 against S. aureus, good to moderate activity against S. epidermidis, moderate activity against B. subtilis, and weak activity against E. floccosum and T. rubrum. The in vitro bactericidal effect of 1 and 2 against the Gram-positive bacterial strains tested is suggested by MBC:MIC ratios of 2:1.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of DNA aptamers against Escherichia coli using a bacterial cell-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment approach.
AB  - Aptamers are powerful capturing probes against various targets such as proteins,  small organic compounds, metal ions, and even cells. In this study, we isolated and characterized single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers against Escherichia coli. A total of 28 ssDNAs were isolated after 10 rounds of selection using a bacterial cell-SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) process. Other bacterial species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were used for counter selection to enhance the selectivity of ssDNA aptamers against E. coli. Finally, four ssDNA aptamers showed high affinity and selectivity to E. coli, The dissociation constants (K(d)) of these four ssDNA aptamers to E. coli were estimated to range from 12.4 to 25.2 nM. These aptamers did not bind to other bacterial species, including four counter cells, but they showed affinity to different E. coli strains. The binding of these four aptamers to E. coli was observed directly by fluorescence microscopy.
TI  - A comparative study of three Aloe species used to treat skin diseases in South African rural communities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Aloe species have been noted to be a miracle cure used by indigenous  people of southern Africa. Geographically, each of the three Aloe species-Aloe arborescens, Aloe excelsa, and Aloe ferox-has a specific habitat. Although some species overlap in geographical regions, the species most abundant in a region is most often utilized by indigenous people. All three species display similar curative properties, aiding in wound healing, cures against other skin ailments, and some systemic conditions. RESULTS: All three Aloe species indicated high inhibitory activity against all gram-positive bacteria under investigation. The ethanol extract was most effective and inhibited all gram-positive bacteria and two gram-negative bacteria (i.e., Proteus vulgaris and Escherichia coli). CONCLUSIONS: All fungal species under investigation were successfully inhibited by both the boiled water as well as the ethanol extract, substantiating the traditional usage of this species.
TI  - National multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) surveillance in France through the RAISIN network: a 9 year experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the mid-1990s, the prevalence rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) in French hospitals was high and control of MDRB spread then became a major priority in the national infection control programme (ICP). METHODS: To evaluate the impact of the ICP, a national coordination of MDRB surveillance was set up in 2002. Data were collected 3 months a year in healthcare facilities (HCFs) on a voluntary basis. All clinical specimens of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLE) were prospectively included. Incidences per 1000 patient days (PDs) were calculated and trends in incidence from 2003 to 2010 were assessed. RESULTS: Participation in the surveillance increased from 478 HCFs in 2002 to 933 in 2010. In 2010, MRSA incidence was 0.40/1000 PDs: 1.14 in intensive care units (ICUs), 0.48 in acute care facilities (ACFs) and 0.27 in rehabilitation and long-term care facilities (RLTCFs). ESBLE incidence was 0.39/1000 PDs: 1.63 in ICUs, 0.46 in ACFs and 0.23 in RLTCFs. MRSA incidence significantly decreased from 0.72/1000 PDs in 2003 to 0.41/1000 PDs in 2010 (P<10(-3)); in contrast, ESBLE incidence significantly increased from 0.17/1000 PDs to 0.48/1000 PDs (P<10(-3)). The most prevalent ESBLE were Enterobacter aerogenes (34%) and Escherichia coli (25%) in 2003 and E. coli (60%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (18%) in 2010. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the positive impact of the national ICP on MRSA rates. In contrast, ESBLE incidence, especially ESBL-producing E. coli, is increasing dramatically and represents a serious threat for hospitals and for the community that deserves specific control actions.
TI  - R164H and V240H replacements by site-directed mutagenesis of TEM-149 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase: kinetic analysis of TEM-149H240 and TEM-149H164-H240 laboratory mutants.
AB  - Two laboratory mutant forms, TEM-149(H240) and TEM-149(H164-H240), of the TEM-149 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enzyme were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. TEM-149(H240) and TEM-149(H164-H240) were similar in kinetic behavior, except with respect to benzylpenicillin and ceftazidime. Molecular modeling of the two mutant enzymes demonstrated the role of histidine at position 240 in the reduction of the affinity of the enzyme for ceftazidime.
TI  - Essential oil variation in the populations of Artemisia spicigera from northwest  of Iran: chemical composition and antibacterial activity.
AB  - CONTEXT: Artemisia spicigera C. Koch (Asteraceae) is a perennial shrubby herb and is generally distributed in Armenia, Iran, and Middle Anatolia. This species traditionally has been used in medicines. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research is to study the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from Artemisia spicigera populations in northwest of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oil of A. spicigera was obtained by hydrodistillation from eight populations collected from different regions of East Azerbaijan and West Azerbaijan provinces (Iran) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antibacterial activity of the oils was investigated against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria using MIC determinations and the agar-gel diffusion method. RESULTS: Fourteen compounds were identified as the main components of the essential oils and the most abundant constituents are 1,8-cineole, camphor, alpha-thujone, camphene, beta-thujone and p-cymene. Essential oil of population No. 1 showed the highest activity against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus but the highest activity against St. saprophyticus, Bacillus megaterium, and B. cereus was found with population No. 6 and for Citrobacter amalonaficus with population No. 5. MIC values of essential oils ranged from 6 microg/mL against Bacillus megaterium to 12 microg/mL against Citrobacter amalonaficus. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the occurrence of 1,8-cineole/camphor/camphene chemotype of A. spicigera but there is also significant chemical variation between the studied populations. The findings showed the studied oils have good antibacterial activity, and thus potential to be used as natural health products.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of herbs and spices against bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel incompatibility group X3 plasmid carrying bla NDM-1 in Enterobacteriaceae isolates with epidemiological links to multiple geographical areas in China.
AB  - The New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) is one of the most important resistance traits in Enterobacteriaceae. We characterized nine bla NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae recovered from seven patients who have recently travelled or been treated in India (n=1) or mainland China (n=6) during December 2010-May 2012. All the China-linked patients had no links to the Indian subcontinent. The bla NDM-1 carrying plasmids belonged to the novel IncX3 ( approximately 50 kb, in seven isolates including two Escherichia coli, two Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Citrobacter freundii, one Enterobacter aerogenes and one E. cloacae), IncA/C2 ( approximately 140 kb, in one E. coli) or FII-F1B groups ( approximately 110 kb, in one E. coli). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the seven IncX3 plasmids revealed identical pattern in six and two bands difference in the remaining one. The IncX3 plasmids carrying bla NDM-1 were epidemiologically linked to Guangzhou (n=1), Hunan (n=4), Haifeng (n=1) and Dongguan (n=1) in mainland China. Complete sequencing of the IncX3 plasmid pNDM-HN380 revealed that it was 54 035 bp long and encoded 52 open reading frames. The bla NDM-1 gene was found in a transposon-like structure flanked by ISAba125 and IS26, inserted into the plasmid genetic load region. The sequences of the bla NDM-1 containing module within the two IS elements were identical to those previously described for bla NDM-1-positive Tn125 in the plasmids or chromosome of Acinetobacter isolates. In summary, this is the first description of IncX3 plasmids carrying bla NDM-1. The findings indicate the worrisome involvement of an epidemic plasmid in the dissemination of NDM-1 in China.
TI  - Postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of Cote d'Ivoire.
AB  - The distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in Cote d'Ivoire, and their roles in the food poisoning were evaluated. Microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus spores, fungi and Clostridium perfringens. The results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5) to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) CFU g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged, respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) CFU g(-1) and 1.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) CFU g(-1). Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundi, Enterobacter amnigenus, Citrobacter youngae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and Rhizopus spp., Mucor spp., Thamnidium spp., Fusarium spp., Moniliella spp. the fungi. Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were not found. The occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in Cote d'Ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct HACCP system during the production. Attieke is especially a well-known product in West Africa; hence, it is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. Overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.
TI  - Discovery and biological characterization of geranylated RNA in bacteria.
AB  - A general MS-based screen for unusually hydrophobic cellular small molecule-RNA conjugates revealed geranylated RNA in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica var. Typhimurium. The geranyl group is conjugated to the sulfur atom in two 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine nucleotides. These geranylated nucleotides occur in the first anticodon position of tRNA(Glu)(UUC), tRNA(Lys)(UUU) and tRNA(Gln)(UUG) at a frequency of up to 6.7% (~400 geranylated nucleotides per cell). RNA geranylation can be increased or abolished by mutation or deletion of the selU (ybbB) gene in E. coli, and purified SelU protein in the presence of geranyl pyrophosphate and tRNA can produce geranylated tRNA. The presence or absence of the geranyl group in tRNA(Glu)(UUC), tRNA(Lys)(UUU) and tRNA(Gln)(UUG) affects codon bias and frameshifting during translation. These RNAs represent the first reported examples of oligoisoprenylated cellular nucleic acids.
TI  - Antimicrobial aflatoxins from the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus flavus 092008.
AB  - A new aflatoxin, aflatoxin B(2b) (1), together with six known compounds, were isolated from the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus flavus 092008 endogenous with the mangrove plant Hibiscus tiliaceus (Malvaceae). The structure of 1 was determined by the spectroscopic and chemical methods. Compound 1 exhibited a moderate antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Enterobacter aerogenes, with MIC values of 22.5, 1.7 and 1.1 M, respectively. Compound 1 also showed a weak cytotoxicity against A549, K562 and L-02 cell lines, with IC(50) values of 8.1, 2.0 and 4.2 M, respectively. The results showed that hydration and hydrogenation of (8)-double bond significantly reduces the cytotoxicity of aflatoxins, while the esterification at C-8 increases the cytotoxicity.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates to tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the in vitro susceptibility of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDRE) isolates to tigecycline. METHODS: Clinical isolates of MDRE tested in this study were obtained from 91 hospitals in Belgium during the period January 2010 to April 2010. MICs of tigecycline were determined by Vitek 2 (VTK) and by the reference broth microdilution (BMD) method, and the results were interpreted based on the 2011 MIC interpretative criteria recommended by EUCAST. RESULTS: A total of 501 non-duplicate MDRE isolates were tested. These comprised 284 isolates of Escherichia coli [255 (89.7%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates], 72 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae [53 (73.6%) were ESBL-producing isolates], 72 isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes, 33 isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, 19 isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca and 21 miscellaneous others. The MIC(90) values of tigecycline for E. coli and non-E. coli ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were 0.5 and 2 mg/L by BMD, and 0.5 and 8 mg/L by VTK, respectively. The highest essential and categorical agreement rates between VTK and BMD results using EUCAST breakpoints were observed in E. coli isolates (97.2%), while lower and unacceptable essential and categorical agreement rates were obtained for isolates belonging to species other than E. coli (81.1% and 59.4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: VTK appears to be a suitable method for routine susceptibility testing of tigecycline only for E. coli isolates, while BMD should be preferred for other Enterobacteriaceae species isolates.
TI  - Class 1 integron gene cassettes in multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in  southern China.
AB  - Non-duplicate multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (n=1447) isolated from January 2008 to December 2009 were investigated for the presence of integrons as well as characterisation of gene cassettes. Among 825 strains carrying the class 1 integrase gene intI1, 461 gene cassette-positive isolates were found. Thirty-eight distinct gene cassette arrays were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing analyses. In addition, several novel gene cassette arrays detected in this study were reported for the first time in some species: one in Escherichia coli, six in Klebsiella pneumoniae, six in Enterobacter cloacae, three in Enterobacter aerogenes, one in Proteus mirabilis, one in Acinetobacter spp., one in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and one in Pseudomonas putida. Among them, three cassettes, including HAD-like, DeltaMFS-1 and qnrVC-like genes, were originally detected in integrons.
TI  - Thymus maroccanus essential oil, a membranotropic compound active on Gram-negative bacteria and resistant isolates.
AB  - AIMS: The effects of Thymus maroccanus essential oil (EO) on the integrity of the cell membranes and the permeability of the outer membrane (OM) and inner membrane (IM) of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium were investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacterial release of intracellular proteins, cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase and periplasmic beta-lactamase induced by T. maroccanus EO was compared to the membranotropic activity of polymyxin B (PB) known as an effective permeabilizer of the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Results showed that T. maroccanus EO increased the permeability of the OM and IM of studied bacteria and induced the release of intracellular proteins into the external medium. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of T. maroccanus EO on the outer membrane was comparable to that of PB, and both T. maroccanus EO and PB induce similar levels of beta-lactamase release. In addition, it also promoted the release of the cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase. Moreover, the lipopolysaccharide molecules and the overexpression of efflux pumps seem to play a crucial role in the level of susceptibility of studied bacteria to the permeabilizing effect of T. maroccanus EO. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: These results demonstrate that T. maroccanus EO can restore antibiotic activity by targeting the two bacterial membranes and would be attractive candidates for developing new adjuvants for combating resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Spread of an OmpK36-modified ST15 Klebsiella pneumoniae variant during an outbreak involving multiple carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae species and clones.
AB  - We aim to characterise multiple ertapenem-resistant (ERT-R, n = 15) Enterobacteriaceae isolates identified as presumptive carbapenemase producers in a Portuguese hospital in a short period of time (March-July 2010). Antibiotic susceptibility patterns, beta-lactamases, genetic relatedness [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)], plasmid content and major enterobacterial porins were investigated. Ertapenem resistance was associated with deficiencies in major porins and, in some cases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC beta-lactamase production among outbreak and non-outbreak clones. Most isolates (n = 8) corresponded to two ERT-R Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15 PFGE-types: (i) a sporadic variant (Kp-A-ERT, n = 1) presenting a premature stop codon in ompK36 and (ii) an epidemic variant (Kp-B-ERT, n = 7) exhibiting a new OmpK36 porin variant, which differed additionally in plasmid and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. ST14 (n = 1) and ST45 (n = 1) K. pneumoniae, ST131 (n = 1) and ST354 (n = 1) Escherichia coli, Enterobacter asburiae (n = 1), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1) ERT-R clones were also sporadically detected. Porin changes in these isolates included non-sense mutations [ompK35, ompK36, ompF; minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 4-32 mg/l], IS-mediated porin disruptions (ompK36, ompC; MIC = 12->32 mg/l) or alterations in the L3 loop (ompK36; MIC = 4-16 mg/l). We describe, for the first time in Portugal, the simultaneous emergence of multiple ERT-R Enterobacteriaceae species and clones in a short period of time. Moreover, our results support that a CTX-M-15-producing ST15 K. pneumoniae with an OmpK36-modified porin might successfully spread in the nosocomial setting.
TI  - Synthesis, Characterization and In Vitro Antibacterial Studies of Organotin(IV) Complexes with 2-Hydroxyacetophenone-2-methylphenylthiosemicarbazone (H(2)dampt).
AB  - Five new organotin(IV) complexes of 2-hydroxyacetophenone-2-methylphenylthiosemicarbazone [H(2)dampt, (1)] with formula [RSnCl(n-1)(dampt)] (where R = Me, n = 2 (2); R = Bu, n = 2 (3); R = Ph, n = 2 (4); R = Me(2), n = 1 (5); R = Ph(2), n = 1 (6)) have been synthesized by direct reaction of H(2)dampt (1) with organotin(IV) chloride(s) in absolute methanol. The ligand (1) and its organotin(IV) complexes (2-6) were characterized by CHN analyses, molar conductivity, UV-Vis, FT-IR, (1)H, (13)C, and (119)Sn NMR spectral studies. H(2)dampt (1) is newly synthesized and has been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. Spectroscopic data suggested that H(2)dampt (1) is coordinated to the tin(IV) atom through the thiolate-S, azomethine-N, and phenoxide-O atoms; the coordination number of tin is five. The in vitro antibacterial activity has been evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi. The screening results have shown that the organotin(IV) complexes (2-6) have better antibacterial activities and have potential as drugs. Furthermore, it has been shown that diphenyltin(IV) derivative (6) exhibits significantly better activity than the other organotin(IV) derivatives (2-5).
TI  - Comparison of sensing strategies in SPR biosensor for rapid and sensitive enumeration of bacteria.
AB  - Rapid and sensitive detections of microorganisms are very important for biodefence, food safety, medical diagnosis and pharmaceutics. The present study aims to find out the most proper bioactive surface preparation method to develop rapid, sensitive and selective bacteria biosensor, based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. Escherichia coli (E. coli) was used as a model bacterium and four sensing strategies in SPR were tested. Three of these strategies are antibody immobilization methods that are non-specific adsorption, specific adsorption via the avidin-biotin interaction, and immobilization of antibodies via self-assembled monolayer formation. The fourth strategy is a novel method for bacteria enumeration based on the combination of the SPR spectroscopy and immunomagnetic separation with using gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles. According to results, the most efficient SPR method is the one based on gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles. This method allows to specifically separate E. coli from the environment and to quantify rapidly without any labeling procedure. The developed method has a linear range between 30 and 3.0 x 10(4)cfu/ml, and a detection limit of 3 cfu/ml. The selectivity of the method was examined with Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter dissolvens, which did not produce any significant response. The usefulness of the method to detect E. coli in real water samples was also investigated, and the results were compared with the results from plate-counting method. There was no significant difference between the methods (p>0.05).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. In this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). RESULTS: It was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to rosuvastatin. On the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. Furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. CONCLUSION: Our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.
TI  - Development of sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of Cronobacter muytjensii (formerly called Enterobacter sakazakii).
AB  - This study aimed to produce a polyclonal antibody against Cronobacter muytjensii  (C. muytjensii, formerly called Enterobacter sakazakii) and to develop an immunoassay for its detection. The optimum production of rabbit anti-C. muytjensii immunoglobulin G (IgG) and chicken anti-C. muytjensii IgY was reached in weeks 8 and 9, respectively. Purification of rabbit anti-C. muytjensii IgG from immunized rabbit sera was accomplished using the caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate precipitation method. As a result, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis produced two bands around 25 and 50 kDa, corresponding to a light and a heavy chain, respectively. The optimized conditions for sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were using rabbit anti-C. muytjensii IgG (1 mug/mL) as a detection antibody and chicken anti-C. muytjensii IgY (10 mug/mL) as a capture antibody. In this assay, no cross-reactivity was observed with the other genera of pathogenic bacteria tested, which included Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. The developed assay did not show cross-reactivity with other tested species of Cronobacter and Enterobacter genera such as C. turicensis, C. sakazakii, E. aerogenes, E. pulveris and E. helveticus. The detection limit of sandwich ELISA for C. muytjensii was found to be 2.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU)/mL. In addition, detection of C. muytjensii in infant formula powder showed a low matrix effect on the detection curve of sandwich ELISA for C. muytjensii, the detection limit being found to be 6.3 x 10(4) CFU/mL. These findings demonstrate that the developed method is able to detect all strains of C. muytjensii. Hence, this ELISA technique has potent application for the rapid and accurate detection of C. muytjensii in dietary foods.
TI  - Phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using Morinda citrifolia L. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
AB  - Leaf extract of Morinda citrifolia L. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. Synthesized nanoscale (MCAgNPs) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using UV-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. Further SEM, HRTEM analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and SEAD pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the MCAgNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) of synthesized MCAgNPs confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. Further, inhibitory activity of MCAgNPs and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like Eschericia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus and Enterococci sp. The results indicated that the MCAgNPs showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.
TI  - [Epidemiology of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae in a General Hospital, South of France, 1999-2007].
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The global epidemiology of extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae has evolved in recent years with the emergence of a new type of ESBL: CTX-M, mainly in Escherichia coli. These CTX-M type producing Enterobacteriaceae are responsible for both nosocomial and, more recently, community infections, including urinary tract infections. The aim of our work is to study ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae evolution between 1999 and 2007 in the population from the Centre Hospitalier du Pays-d'Aix (CHPA), a general hospital from South of France. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ESBL producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated in odd years between 1999 and 2007 from clinical isolates of all origins have been phenotypically identified and their ESBL genotyped. Molecular and epidemiological data from our hospital health-care associated infection committee were analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-two ESBL producing isolates were studied. Within ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae, Enterobacter aerogenes was predominant in 1999 (48.7% of isolates), and decreased to 18.8% of isolates in 2007. On the other hand, E. coli, which represented 10.5% of ESBL isolates in 1999, grew up to 37.5% of the isolates in 2007. ESBL prevalence in E. coli increased during this period from 0.3 to 2.5%. Simultaneously, ESBL, predominantly TEM-24 in 1999, were replaced by CTX-M in 2007, among which CTX-M-15 is predominant (88% of CTX-M). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms a major change in ESBL epidemiology in CHPA, with the emergence of CTX-M type ESBL, mainly CTX-M 15, and an increase of ESBL prevalence in E. coli.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates of ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime and aztreonam.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in vitro susceptibility of ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae (ENSE) isolates to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime and aztreonam. METHODS: Clinical isolates of ENSE tested in this study were obtained from 10 major teaching hospitals in Taiwan during the period January 2008 to October 2010. MICs of ertapenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime and aztreonam were determined by the agar dilution method and were interpreted based on 2011 MIC interpretive criteria recommended by the CLSI and EUCAST. RESULTS: A total of 412 non-duplicate ENSE isolates (with ertapenem MIC values >/= 0.5 mg/L) were tested. These comprised 72 isolates of Escherichia coli [28 (38.9%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates], 167 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae [74 (44.3%) were ESBL-producing isolates], 115 isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, 13 isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes, 20 isolates of Citrobacter freundii and 25 isolates of Serratia marcescens. According to 2011 CLSI (EUCAST) MIC interpretive breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae, 64% (31%) of all ENSE isolates, 45.8% (16.7%) of E. coli isolates, 53% (29.3%) of K. pneumoniae isolates and 86.1% (35.7%) of E. cloacae isolates were susceptible to cefepime. As for ESBL-producing ENSE isolates, 25% and 14.3% of E. coli isolates and 36.5% and 10.8% of K. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to cefepime based on CLSI and EUCAST criteria, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cefepime exerts in vitro antimicrobial activity against a significant portion of clinical isolates of ENSE, although there are discrepancies between results obtained using the CLSI-2011 and EUCAST-2011 guidelines.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Ulopterol isolated from Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam.: a  traditional medicinal plant.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The leaves of Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. (Rutaceae) are widely used in folk medicine in India to treat various ailments like cough, malaria, indigestion, influenza lung diseases and rheumatism, fever, stomach ailments, cholera and diarrhea. In our earlier communication we have reported the antimicrobial study on the various extracts of the leaves and the isolation and identification of Flindersine, a quinolone alkaloid as the major active principle. In the present study, we report the antibacterial and antifungal activities of Ulopterol, a coumarin isolated as another major active antimicrobial principle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leaves were successively extracted with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol and water. The extracts were studied for their antimicrobial activity against selected bacteria and fungi by using disc-diffusion method. The ethyl acetate extract which was found to possess highest antimicrobial activity was subjected to activity guided fractionation by column chromatography over silica gel. This resulted in the isolation of the coumarin, Ulopetrol, an active principle besides Flindersine which was reported by us earlier. The structure of the compound was elucidated using physical and spectroscopic data. Flindersine and Ulopterol were quantified by HPLC. RESULTS: Ulopterol showed activity against the bacteria viz. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-3967), Escherichia coli (ESBL-3984) and fungi viz. Aspergillus flavus, Candida krusei and Botrytis cinerea. Quantification by HPLC showed the content of Flindersine and Ulopterol to be 0.361% and 0.266% respectively on dry weight basis of the leaves. CONCLUSIONS: Ethyl acetate extract (successive extraction) contained Ulopterol, a coumarin, besides Flindersine, a quinolone alkaloid, as a major active principle in the antimicrobial studies. This is the first report of the antimicrobial activity of Ulopterol and also its first report from the plant.
TI  - In vivo antioxidative property, antimicrobial and wound healing activity of flower extracts of Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers. (Bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of Pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic extracts of Pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in Wistar rats. Healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. Antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. In vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. RESULTS: The results indicated that Pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. Pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Candida tropicana. During early wound healing phase TNF-alpha and IL-6 level were found to be up regulated by Pyrostegia venusta treatment. CONCLUSION: Increased wound contraction and tensile strength, augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by Pyrostegia venusta flower extract. Induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by Pyrostegia venusta extract. Results suggest that Pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.
TI  - Triterpenoid acids and lactones from the leaves of Fadogia tetraquetra var. tetraquetra (Rubiaceae).
AB  - Four triterpenoids isolated from the leaves of Fadogia tetraquetra var. tetraquetra, 3beta-hydroxy-11alpha, 12alpha-epoxyoleanan-28,13beta-olide (1), 3beta-hydroxyurs-11-en-28,13beta-olide (2), oleanolic acid (3), and ursolic acid (4), were evaluated for their antiviral and antibacterial properties. Compound 4 showed potent activity against the Semliki Forest virus with an IC50 of 14.7 microM, but was also found to be significantly cytotoxic (68% reduction in cell viability after 24 hours exposure at 50 microM) towards baby hamster kidney (BHK21) host cells. A viability assay on the mammalian human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cell line showed no significant effects on intracellular ATP content after 48 hours exposure to compounds 1-4 at this concentration. Compound 4 also inhibited Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 12.5 microM), but was inactive against Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Compounds 1-3 were inactive against all tested bacterial strains at 50 microM concentration.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some Indian Ayurvedic preparations against enteric bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In Ayurveda, various herbal preparations are clinically used to prevent or cure infectious diseases. Herbal preparations such as Triphala churna, Hareetaki churna, Dashmula churna, Manjistadi churna, Sukhsarak churna, Ajmodadi churna, Shivkshar pachan churna, Mahasudarshan churna, Swadist Virechan churna and Pipramool churna were investigated by preparing their organic solvent extract for antibacterial potential against enteric bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus vulgaris, respectively. In the present study, Triphala churna, Hareetaki churna, Dashmula churna were potent antibacterial agents against S. epidermidis, P. vulgaris, S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. typhi. The study supports the use of these herbal preparations not only as dietary supplements but also as agents to prevent or control enteric bacterial infections.
TI  - Inter-laboratory comparison of different rapid methods for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates still represents a major risk in transfusion medicine, and a variety of screening methods have been available to improve the safety of PCs. In the present study, the analytical quality of three different rapid screening methods (BactiFlow flow cytometry, Pan Genera Detection Assay, 23S rRNA RT-PCR) was evaluated in an inter-laboratory comparison in three different German blood services. METHODS: Samples were inoculated with different bacteria [Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli (two strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (one strain), Serratia marcescens (one strain)] at different counts (4.5 x 10(3) -4.5 x 10(8) CFU/ml) alternating with negative samples in one transfusion facility. Samples were blinded with a random order for each screening method, shipped to partners and analysed immediately after receipt with different rapid screening methods. RESULTS: The inter-laboratory comparison revealed that the BactiFlow assay and 23S rRNA RT-PCR-screening detected all samples correctly (positive: 12/12, negative: 8/8). The Pan Genera Detection Assay test detected only four of the positive samples. Four of the non-detected positive samples were below the assay's detection limit. Another four inoculated samples with comparatively high bacteria counts were detected false negative (E. coli (two strains): 9.87 x 10(5) and 2.10 x 10(7) CFU/ml, respectively, K. pneumoniae: 4.79 x 10(6) CFU/ml, S. aureus: 6.03 x 10(5) CFU/ml). All rapid screening methods revealed no false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Both BactiFlow and 23S rRNA RT-PCR demonstrated a high sensitivity to detecting bacterial contamination in PCs. The Pan Genera Detection Assay had some shortcomings regarding sensitivity, especially for the detection of Gram-negative strains.
TI  - Prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and its association with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC beta-lactamase in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and its association with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC beta-lactamase in Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: A total of 347 non-duplicated isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were collected between August and October 2006 from 2 hospitals. Qnr determinant screening was conducted using PCR amplification, and all positive results were confirmed by direct sequencing. Qnr-positive strains were determined on the basis of the presence of ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamase genes. RESULTS: The qnr gene was detected in 47 of 347 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Among the 47 qnr-positive strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae (N=29) was the most common, followed by Escherichia coli (N=6), Enterobacter cloacae (N=6), Citrobacter freundii (N=5), and Enterobacter aerogenes (N=1). These isolates were identified as qnrA1 (N=6), 8 qnrB subtypes (N=40), and qnrS1 (N=1). At least 1 ESBL was detected in 38 of the 47 qnr-positive strains. Qnr-positive strains also showed high positive rates of ESBL or AmpC beta-lactamase, such as TEM, SHV, CTX-M, and DHA. DHA-1 was detected in 23 of 47 qnr-positive strains, and this was co-produced with 1 qnrA1 and 22 qnrB4. Strains harboring MIR-1T and CMY were also detected among the qnr-positive strains. Antimicrobial-resistance rates of qnr-positive strains to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, and moxifloxacin were 51.1%, 46.8%, 46.8%, 74.5%, and 53.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The qnr genes were highly prevalent in Enterobacteriaceae, primarily the qnrB subtypes. They were closely associated with EBSL and AmpC beta-lactamase.
TI  - Genetic characterization of an extended-spectrum AmpC cephalosporinase with hydrolysing activity against fourth-generation cephalosporins in a clinical isolate of Enterobacter aerogenes selected in vivo.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum AmpC cephalosporinases (ESACs) have been reported in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Here, we characterize a new AmpC variant presenting a broadened substrate activity towards fourth-generation cephalosporins, selected in vivo following cefepime treatment for Enterobacter aerogenes. METHODS: Two consecutive clonally related isolates of E. aerogenes were evaluated. Screening for ESAC production was performed using plates containing 200 mg/L cloxacillin. MICs were determined by microdilution (CLSI guidelines). bla(AmpC) genes were cloned into a pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The ampC genes were cloned into vector pGEX-6P-1 for protein purification. RESULTS: Isolate Ea595 was resistant to two fourth-generation cephalosporins, cefepime and cefpirome; using plates containing cloxacillin, susceptibility to ceftazidime and cefepime was restored, suggesting overproduction of the ESAC beta-lactamase. Sequencing identified a new AmpC beta-lactamase variant presenting one amino acid substitution, Val291Gly, inside the H-10 helix. Recombinant plasmids harbouring this ESAC beta-lactamase conferred a broadened resistance profile to cefepime and cefpirome, with resistance levels increasing from 16- to 32-fold in E. coli. AmpC-Ea595 hydrolysed ceftazidime, cefepime and cefpirome at high levels, presenting a lower K(m) and enabling us to classify the enzyme as an ESAC. Homology modelling suggested that the size of the active site could have increased. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized an ESAC beta-lactamase selected in vivo and conferring a high level of resistance to fourth-generation cephalosporins in E. aerogenes. The broadened spectrum was caused by a new modification to the H-10 helix, which modified the active site.
TI  - Effect of temperature on survival of pathogenic bacteria in biogas plants.
AB  - The paper deals with the hygienic advantages of sanitation to treat dairy manure  in full-scale biogas plants. The slurry samples were collected from two thermophilic biogas plants (55 degrees C) and two mesophilic biogas plants (38 degrees C) in Hokkaido Japan. A detectable number of Coli-aerogenes group and Enterococcus in the slurries after anaerobic digestion (AD) could not be found in either thermophilic biogas plants. However, in both mesophilic biogas plants the viable numbers of Coli-aerogenes group and Enterococcus were detected in the slurries even after anaerobic digestion. The mean decimation reduction time (T(90) ) values of the Coli-aerogenes group and Enterococcus in the slurries during mesophilic digestion were 13.3 days and 16.7 days, respectively.
TI  - Dissemination of the rmtB gene carried on IncF and IncN plasmids among Enterobacteriaceae in a pig farm and its environment.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and characterization of 16S rRNA methylase-producing bacteria in a pig farm and its environment in East China. METHODS: Enterobacteriaceae isolates and metagenomic DNA from 102 pig faecal samples from a pig farm and 97 soil samples taken in or around the farm were screened for the presence of 16S rRNA methylase genes. The clonal relationships of 16S rRNA methylase-positive isolates, plasmid content and other associated resistance genes were also characterized. RESULTS: Fifty-six rmtB-positive Enterobacteriaceae isolates, including 54 Escherichia coli, 1 Morganella morganii and 1 Proteus mirabilis, were recovered from 55 pig faecal samples. Nineteen rmtB-positive bacteria, including 13 E. coli, 2 M. morganii, 2 Leclercia adecarboxylata, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 Enterobacter cloacae, were recovered from 16 soil samples. Among the 75 rmtB-positive isolates, 31 and 25 also carried the qepA and bla(CTX-M) genes, respectively. The qepA gene co-localized with rmtB on the F2:A-:B1 plasmids and the bla(CTX-M-65) gene co-localized with rmtB on the F33:A-:B- plasmids. The rmtB gene was also found to be associated with the IncN plasmids. Clonal transmission of rmtB-positive E. coli isolates was observed between different pig groups and soil samples. CONCLUSIONS: Both horizontal gene transfer and clonal spread could be responsible for the dissemination of the rmtB gene in the pig farm and its environment. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of rmtB-positive bacteria from farmland soils and indicates that these antibiotic-resistant bacteria and/or resistance genes could be acquired by humans through the food chain.
TI  - Genotypic characterization and in vitro activities of tigecycline and polymyxin B for members of the Enterobacteriaceae with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems.
AB  - Carbapenem resistance in members of the Enterobacteriaceae is increasing. To evaluate the effects of tigecycline and polymyxin B against carbapenem-non-susceptible pathogens, 89 representative clinical carbapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates were recovered from seven hospitals from four cities in China during 2006-2009: 30 Serratia marcescens, 35 Klebsiella pneumoniae, seven Enterobacter cloacae, six Enterobacter aerogenes, five Escherichia coli, four Citrobacter freundii and two Klebsiella oxytoca isolates. Twenty-eight S. marcescens isolates were indistinguishable. The 35 K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to 12 clonal strains. Among the 89 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 82 produced KPC-2, seven produced IMP (three produced KPC-2 simultaneously), three did not produce any carbapenemases and nine were deficient in porins. Polymyxin B was much more active than tigecycline against carbapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, polymyxin B and tigecycline were 8 and 32 microg ml(-1), 8 and 32 microg ml(-1), 16 and 128 microg ml(-1), 0.5 and 16 microg ml(-1), and 4 and 16 microg ml(-1), respectively. Rates of susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem and polymyxin B were 30.0%, 27.5%, 2.5% and 89.2% by CLSI criteria. The rate of susceptibility to tigecycline was 40% and 17.5% by Food and Drug Administration (MIC </=2 microg ml(-1)) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MIC </=1 microg ml(-1)) criteria, respectively. KPC-2- or IMP-producing E. coli transconjugants exhibited reduced susceptibility to carbapenems but were susceptible to polymyxin B and tigecycline with an MIC range of 0.5-2 microg ml(-1), 0.25-2 microg ml(-1), 0.5-4 microg ml(-1), 0.5 microg ml(-1) and 0.5-1 microg ml(-1). In conclusion, carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is mainly due to production of KPC-2, and polymyxin B is active for the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the Philippines.
AB  - beta-Lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpC beta-lactamases, are major resistance mechanisms of Enterobacteriaceae. Emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants in ESBL-producing isolates poses a global threat. The molecular characterisitcs of ESBL and PMQR determinants in the Philippines are not well characterized. In this study, we investigated ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the Philippines, and analyzed the association between ESBL and PMQR genes. A total of 91 amoxicilin non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae were collected at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine of the Philippines from 2006 to 2008. AmpC- or ESBL-producing isolates were screened by detecting a zone diameter for cefoxitin </= 14 mm or cefpodoxime </= 20 mm, respectively. Possible ESBL-producing strains were assessed by the ESBL confirmation test of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. PCR and sequencing were performed to detect the ESBL and PMQR genes. The number of ESBL-producers and AmpC-producers confirmed phenotypically was 17 (18.7%) and 61 (67.0%), respectively. Of 17 phenotypic ESBL-producers, 14 isolates had ESBL genes, including 6 of Escherichia coli, 3 of Enterobacter cloacae, 2 of Enterobacter aerogenes, 2 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 of Klebsiella ozaenae. Among these isolates, there were 13, 4, and 12 with bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV), and bla(TEM), respectively. Of the bla(CTX-M)-positive isolates, bla(CTX-M-15) shows the highest prevalence, followed by bla(CTX-M-3) and bla(CTX-M-14). Of 14 ESBL-producers identified by PCR, 4, 6, and 7 isolates were positive for qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6')-Ib-cr, respectively. The frequency of aac(6')-Ib-cr positivity was significantly higher among CTX-M-15-producing isolates. Thus, we identified bla(CTX-M), aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qnr in ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae from the Philippines, and revealed a significant association between bla(CTX-M-15) and aac(6')-Ib-cr. Local epidemiological data are important for implementing appropriate antimicrobial therapy and effective infection control measures. Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance genes in the Philippines will be required.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory amino acid derivatives from the ascidian Herdmania momus.
AB  - Four new amino acid derivatives, herdmanines A-D (1-4), were isolated from the marine ascidian Herdmania momus. Herdmanines A-C contain the unusual D-form of arginine. Compounds 3 and 4 had a moderate suppressive effect on the production of NO, with IC(5)(0) values of 96 and 9 muM, respectively. These compounds were found to inhibit the mRNA expression of iNOS. The inhibitory activities on the production and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were evaluated.
TI  - Essential oils from Moroccan plants as potential chemosensitisers restoring antibiotic activity in resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial drug resistance is a worrying public health problem. Antibiotic efflux  is a major non-specific resistance mechanism used by bacteria, and efflux pumps are involved in the low-level susceptibility of various important Gram-negative pathogens. Use of molecules that can block bacterial pumps is an attractive strategy, but several studies report only partial efficacy owing to limits of these molecules (stability, selectivity, bioavailability, toxicity, etc.). The objective of this study was to search for natural sources of molecules able to inhibit efflux pump systems of resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The results indicate that the studied essential oils exhibit interesting activity against the tested bacteria. This activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor such as phenylalanine arginyl beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN). The role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure in the effect of essential oils was also reported in Salmonella LPS deep-rough mutants. In addition, essential oils of Thymus maroccanus and Thymus broussonetii, used at a low concentration (a fraction of the minimum inhibitory concentration), are able to significantly increase chloramphenicol susceptibility of several resistant isolates. These results demonstrate that these essential oils can alter efflux pump activity and may be attractive candidates to develop new drugs for chemosensitising multidrug-resistant strains to clinically used antibiotics.
TI  - Antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. Intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. However, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. The benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. This study was performed to evaluate the interaction between Lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. RESULTS: Strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in McConkey Agar and identified using PCR with species-specific primers, and the BBL Enterotube II system for Enterobacteriaceae. Gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. The average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) CFU/g of faeces (p = 0.015). The following strains were identified: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus faecalis. Then, 27 Lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii DSM 20074 and L. plantarum MB 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that two out of 27 strains of Lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. Our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which Lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  - Petals of red, yellow and white roses (Rosa damascene Mill.) of the family Rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus), five species of Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (Penicillium notatum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum). All of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. Micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. Red and yellow petal extracts showed much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. Bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. The fungus, Penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. White roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against Penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. Chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of chromogenic agar CM1046 and mFC agar for detection of E. coli and thermotolerant coliform bacteria from water samples.
AB  - AIMS: The equivalence of Oxoid (CM 1046) Brilliance((TM)) E. coli/coliform selective agar to mFC agar, as used in the Australian/New Zealand Standard Method to detect thermotolerant coliforms and Escherichia coli in water samples, was assessed. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 244 water samples were analysed in parallel over a 5-month period. Sewage effluent samples (n = 131, sites = 43), freshwater (n = 62, sites = 18) and marine/brackish water samples (n = 51, sites = 23) were analysed. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test showed a varying degree of statistical difference between the two methods. All matrices had a higher recovery in the trial method. Enterococci faecalis, Aeromonas spp. and Vibrio spp. did not grow on the CM1046 agar, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes were inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CM 1046 for the detection and enumeration of E. coli and thermotolerant coliforms in water samples is a suitable alternative to the AS/NZS Standard Method. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of CM1046 agar was less labour intensive and time consuming, as no secondary confirmation steps were required. Confirmed results could be reported within 24 h of sample analysis, as compared to 48 h with the reference method. Public health concerns can be addressed in a more efficient manner.
TI  - Bacteriologic and plasmid analysis of etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in Lagos, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, is one of the most common eye problems affecting all age groups in Nigeria. A better understanding of its epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility of etiologic bacterial agents is crucial for the initiation of preventive and therapeutic measures. This study determined the distribution and patterns of bacterial infections in Nigerian patients with conjunctivitis. Antibiotic resistance patterns and the plasmid profiles of these pathogens were also investigated. METHODOLOGY: A total of 83 consecutive and non-duplicate conjunctival specimens were collected from patients attending eye clinics at three different hospitals in Lagos, Nigeria, between February and September 2010. Specimens were cultured on standard bacteriologic media and the recovered isolates speciated using standard techniques. Susceptibility of pathogens to antibiotics and plasmid DNA extraction were carried out by disk diffusion and alkaline lysis methods. Conjugation experiment was done with rifampicin-resistant Escherichia coli DH5alpha as the recipient cell. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: All the specimens were culture-positive, yielding a total of 155 bacterial isolates. Gram-positive cocci comprising Staphylococcus aureus (27.7%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp. (22.6%) accounted for 50.3% (78 of 155) of conjunctivitis cases, followed by Gram-positive bacilli (22.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (21.3%), and Gram-negative cocci (4.5%). Corynebacterium spp. were the most commonly isolated Gram-positive bacilli accounting for 16.1% of conjunctivitis cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa topped with 9.7% as the most commonly isolated Gram-negative bacilli. Other Gram-negative bacilli in order of their isolations were E. coli (6.5%), Proteus sp. (3.2%), Klebsiella sp. (1.9%), and Enterobacter aerogenes (1.9%). Moraxella spp. were the only Gram-negative cocci isolated, and they accounted for 4.5% of the total conjunctival infections. Further analysis of the complexity of infections showed that 25 specimens elicited mono-infections, while cases of polymicrobial infections caused by two pathogens and three or more pathogens constituted 51.8% and 18.1% of conjunctivitis specimens screened, respectively. The disparity in the percentage contribution of three infection patterns was significant (P < 0.05). Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol and ofloxacin as the least and most active antibiotics tested as 99 (63.9%) and 149 (96.1%) of the 155 recovered isolates were sensitive to them. On the whole, the least susceptible pathogen was P. aeruginosa with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 80%, while Moraxella sp. represented the most sensitive pathogen with sensitivities ranging from 71.4% to 100%. Other bacterial isolates also elicited antibiotic sensitivities in the range of 33.3-100%. A total of 101 isolates were screened for plasmids, of which 45 harbored plasmids, yielding a plasmid frequency of 44.6%. Conjugal transfer of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin was detected in the transconjugants after the mating experiment. The antibiotic resistances were transferred either singly or in combination from six of the seven selected donor strains. The antibiotic resistance pattern transferred by these donor strains was partial and was associated with the transfer of R plasmids of sizes 21.3, 15.2, and 5.0 kb from three of the six transferable strains. The frequencies of transfer of antibiotype or R plasmids to the transconjugants ranged from 1.8 x 10(-7) to 1.4 x 10(-5) transconjugants per donor strain. CONCLUSION: Conjunctivitis as an eye problem in Lagos is polymicrobial with infections associated with transferable R plasmids for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin. Continuous surveillance of conjunctivitis in relation to etiology, drug susceptibility, and plasmid transferability in the study area is therefore recommended.
TI  - Deposition behavior of self-assembled monolayers and bacteria on metallic surfaces using an electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance.
AB  - This paper presents an investigation on the deposition behavior of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and bacteria on titanium and gold surfaces using an electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN). The tests included alkanethiol and alkanesilane and three bacteria, namely: E. coli, P. fluorescens and K. aerogenes. The mass change with respect to immersion time was measured by EQCN. The results showed SAM formation on both titanium and gold surfaces, but SAM formation on gold was generally higher by 26-74% as compared to that of titanium. On the other hand, bacteria also adhered well on the two metal surfaces. E. coli and P. fluorescens had high affinity on gold and titanium surfaces, respectively, while K. aerogenes was more adherent to titanium. The results showed that titanium and gold are good metals for biomaterials yet at the same time, their bioinert property provide excellent condition for bacterial adhesion. Therefore, there is a need for proper surface preparation to optimize the use of titanium and gold as biomaterials.
TI  - The activity of antimicrobial peptide S-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the activity of S-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. The result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of S-thanatin against all isolates of the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all MICs to Gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except Enterococcus faecium. S-thanatin was more effective toward Gram-negative strains, especially for Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The MICs of S-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (P>0.05). Likewise, no notable difference could be observed between E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, K. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to S-thanatin (P>0.05). It was implied that the antimicrobial activity of S-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.
TI  - Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter, and Proteus
AB  - The Gram-negative bacilli of the genera Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter,and Proteus(Table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. With the exception of Proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. Many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. Today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. A limited number of species, including E coli, K pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, S marcescens,and P mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. The increasing incidence of the coliforms, Proteus, and other Gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. The widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (R factors). Also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host defenses.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities from Siamese crocodile blood.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the Siamese crocodile blood against bacteria and fungi. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Thirty Siamese crocodile blood samples including freeze dried whole blood (FDWB), fresh serum (FS), and freeze dried serum (FDS) were evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility and MIC values against ATCC-registered strains of nine bacterial species and two fungal species and one fungus isolated from a clinical specimen, by using the standard broth microdilution method and a modified resazurin microtiter plate assay. RESULTS: The result showed that FS (80 mg/ml) and FDS (100 mg/ml) inhibited Gram negative bacteria including Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 27736, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 13311 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 with the susceptibility rate at 23.30%, 10.00%, 40.00%, 70.00%, and 86.67%, respectively for FS, and 30.00%, 10.00%, 43.33%, 76.67% and 90.00%, respectively for FDS. The MIC and MBC were in the range of 12.50-100.00 mg/ml and 25.00-100.00 mg/m1 respectively. FS and FDS also inhibited Cryptococcus neoformans 250309 and Aspergillus niger with the susceptibility rate at 90.00% and 80.00%, respectively for FS and 100.00% and 83.33%, respectively for FDS. The MIC was in the range of 25.00-100.00 mg/ml. However, FS and FDS did not inhibit Gram positive bacteria and did not kill fungi. FDWB (100 mg/ml) could neither inhibit bacteria nor fungi. CONCLUSION: FS and FDS from Siamese crocodile exhibited potential antibacterial and antifungal activities.
TI  - Antibacterial abietane-type diterpenoid, taxodone from Metasequoia glyptostroboides Miki ex Hu.
AB  - In an attempt to isolate bioactive constituents, ethyl acetate cone extract of Metasequoia glyptostroboides was subjected to a column chromatographic analysis that resulted in isolation of an abietane-type diterpenoid, taxodone. Its structure was elucidated by spectroscopic means. Further, taxodone showed potential antibacterial effect as diameters of zones of inhibition against foodborne pathogenic bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19166, Salmonella typhimurium KCTC 2515, S. enteritidis KCTC 2021, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 43888, Enterobacter aerogenes KCTC 2190, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and S. aureus KCTC 1916, were found in the range of 9.4 to 14.2 mm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of taxodone against the employed bacterial pathogens were found in the range of 250 to 1000 and 250 to less than 2000 microg/ml, respectively. Also the compound had a strong antibacterial effect on the viable counts of the tested bacteria. These findings indicate that the bioactive compound taxodone present in M. glyptostroboides could be used as an antibacterial agent in food industry to inhibit the growth of certain important foodborne pathogens.
TI  - SERS-based sandwich immunoassay using antibody coated magnetic nanoparticles for  Escherichia coli enumeration.
AB  - A method combining immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was developed to enumerate Escherichia coli (E. coli). Gold-coated magnetic spherical nanoparticles were prepared by immobilizing biotin-labeled anti-E. coli antibodies onto avidin-coated magnetic nanoparticles and used in the separation and concentration of the E. coli cells. Raman labels have been constructed using rod shaped gold nanoparticles coated with 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and subsequently with a molecular recognizer. Then DTNB-labeled gold nanorods were interacted with gold-coated magnetic spherical nanoparticle-antibody-E. coli complex. The capture efficiency and calibration graphs were obtained and examined in different E. coli concentrations (10(1)-10(7) cfu mL(-1)). The correlation between the concentration of bacteria and SERS signal was found to be linear within the range of 10(1)-10(4) cfu mL(-1) (R(2) = 0.992). The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) values of the developed method were found to be 8 and 24 cfu mL(-1), respectively. The selectivity of the developed immunoassay was examined with Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter dissolvens, and Salmonella enteriditis which did not produce any significant response. The ability of the immunoassay to detect E. coli in real water samples was also investigated and the results were compared with the experimental results from plate-counting methods. There was no significant difference between the methods that were compared (p > 0.05). This method is rapid and sensitive to target organisms with a total analysis time of less than 70 min.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the latex of Argemone ochroleuca Sweet.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial effect of the crude latex of Argemone ochroleuca (A. ochroleuca) as antibacterial potential against a range of human pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: This study was carried out at King Khalid University, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from January to March 2010. Seventeen ml of fresh latex from A. ochroleuca Sweet was collected, and the antibacterial activity of crude and diluted latex were examined using one ml of standardized inoculum suspension, and using the agar diffusion method test against Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. All inoculated plates were incubated aerobically at 290C for 48 hours. The diameter of the zones of inhibition was measured to the nearest mm. RESULTS: The crude latex of A. ochroleuca exhibited a potent antibacterial effect on all bacterial strains examined. The zones of inhibition against the tested bacteria were found in the range of 9.30 - 40.3 mm along with their respective minimum inhibitory concentration values 100 ul/ml. CONCLUSION: The observable inhibition on selected bacteria by latex of A. ochroleuca makes it a promising alternative as a potential source of natural antibacterial.
TI  - Trends in production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae of clinical interest: results of a nationwide survey in Belgian hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to assess the frequency and diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Belgium. METHODS: during 2006 and 2008, non-duplicate clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime were collected in 100 Belgian hospitals. ESBL production was confirmed by phenotypic and genotypic tests. MICs of 13 antimicrobial agents were determined by Etest. ESBL-encoding genes were identified by PCR sequencing and the bla(CTX-M) environment was characterized by PCR mapping. Selected isolates were genotyped by PFGE, multilocus sequence typing analysis and phylogenetic grouping by PCR. RESULTS: overall, 733 isolates were confirmed as ESBL producers. Carbapenems and temocillin were active against >/= 95% of all tested isolates. Co-resistance to co-trimoxazole and to ciprofloxacin was found in almost 70% and 80% of the strains, respectively. Overall, Escherichia coli (49%), Enterobacter aerogenes (32%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) represented the most prevalent species. Isolates harboured predominantly TEM-24 (30.7%), CTX-M-15 (24.2%) and TEM-52 (12.1%). Compared with 2006, the proportion of CTX-M-type enzymes increased significantly in 2008 (54% versus 23%; P < 10(-6)), mostly linked to a rising proportion of CTX-M-15-producing E. coli. TEM-24 decreased (19% in 2008 versus 43% in 2006; P < 10(-6)) during the same period, while the prevalence of TEM-52 remained unchanged (10% in 2008 versus 14% in 2006; not significant). Over 80% of the CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates clustered into a single PFGE type and phylogroup B2, corresponding to the sequence type (ST) 131 clone. Intra- and inter-species gene dissemination (CTX-M-15, CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-9) and wide epidemic spread of the CTX-M-15-producing E. coli ST131 clone in several Belgian hospitals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: the rapid emergence of multiresistant CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in Belgium.
TI  - Microbial transformation of albendazole.
AB  - Screening scale studies were performed to biotransform anthelmintic drug albendazole by using twelve bacterial strains representing six genera and five actinomycetes cultures. Among the cultures studied, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 619, Escherichia coli MTCC 118 and Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 109 could transform albendazole to one metabolite whereas, Enterobacter aerogenes NCIM 2695, Klebsiella aerogenes NCIM 2258, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCIM 2074 and Streptomyces griseus NCIM 2622 could transform albendazole into two metabolites in significant quantities. The transformation of albendazole was identified by HPLC. Based on LC-MS-MS data, the two metabolites were predicted to be albendazole sulfoxide (M1) and albendazole sulfone (M2), the major mammalian metabolites reported previously. Since M1 is active metabolite, the results prove the versatility of microorganisms to perform industrially attractive chemical reactions.
TI  - In vitro ciprofloxacin resistance profiles among gram-negative bacteria isolated  from clinical specimens in a teaching hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the trends of ciprofloxacin resistance pattern in commonly isolated gram-negative bacteria over time in a Saudi Arabian teaching hospital. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out for ciprofloxacin resistance patterns of 10089 isolates of gram-negative bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens submitted to microbiology laboratories at King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Alkhobar, Saudi Arabia during the period January 2002 to August 2005. RESULTS: Increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates in these isolates during the years 2002 and 2005 were as follows: Escherichia coli, 23.85 to 33.1%; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 15.93 to 27.55%; Enterobacter cloacae, 12.32 to 18.05%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 4.16 to 25.64%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 17.05 to 39.53%, Pseudomonas spp., 20.58 to 58.77%; H. influenzae, 00.00% to 11.11% and H. aegyptius, 00.00% to 1.73%. CONCLUSION: There was a gradual increase in resistance from year 2002 to 2005 in most of the gram negative isolates i.e. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp showing that ciprofloxacin is no more a drug of choice for gram negative infections by these microbes.
TI  - Synergistic interaction of phenylpropanoids with antibiotics against bacteria.
AB  - Phenylpropanoids constitute a large part of our daily diet and there is a possibility that they might interact with synthetic drugs. The present work was aimed at studying the interaction of seven phenylpropanoids (cinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic and 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid) with five antibiotics (amikacin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and vancomycin) against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. The interaction studies were performed by chequerboard and time-kill curve assays. Both assays revealed that cinnamic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids were the most active. They combined synergistically with the majority of the antibiotics and exhibited enhanced activity against all the micro-organisms. The time-kill curve parameters were better (P<0.05) for the combinations of amikacin with ferulic, cinnamic or p-coumaric acid than for the individual treatments. Amikacin was the most favourable antibiotic and S. aureus was the most sensitive microbe to most of the combinations. These phenylpropanoids damaged the bacterial membrane as assessed by the LIVE/DEAD BacLight kit, and structure-activity relationship studies indicated that hydrophilic groups enhanced this activity.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a phospholipase A2 from the venom of the Saw-scaled viper: Novel bactericidal and membrane damaging activities.
AB  - Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. In this study, a basic myotoxic PLA(2), named EcTx-I was isolated from Echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on Superdex G-75, and reverse phase HPLC on C18 and C8 Sepharose columns. PLA(2), EcTx-I was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by MALDI-TOF (15 kD by SDS-PAGE), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. The N-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic PLA(2)s from other snake venoms. The purified PLA(2) EcTx-I was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW&TES), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. EcTx-I showed strong antibacterial activity against B. pseudomallei (KHW) and E. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. Other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. However, the Gram-positive bacterium E. aerogenes failed to show any effect on EcTx-I protein at tested doses. The most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of EcTx-I was observed at MICs of >15 mug/ml against (B. pseudomallei, KHW) and MICs >30 mug/ml against E. aerogenes. Mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. EcTx-I was able to induce cytotoxicity on THP-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in BALB/c mice. EcTx-I also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. It is shown that the toxic effect induced by E. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic PLA(2) (EcTx-I). The result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. In conclusion, EcTx-I displays a heparin binding C-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.
TI  - Isolation, structure determination and antibacterial activities of succinamide conjugate diacid from Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L.
AB  - Strain BJ-L was isolated from the a water sample taken from Xiao Yue River in Beijing and identified as Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L based on the study of its morphology, physiology, biochemistry and 16S rRNA gene sequence. A new antimicrobial substance was produced after the strain was incubated in potato extract medium at 15 degrees C for 72 h. The antimicrobial substance was sequentially purified by reduced pressure condensation, EtOAc extract, and silica gel column chromatography. The structure of the antimicrobial substance was elucidated as succinamide conjugate diacid (SCD) by spectroscopic data interpretation. Structure analysis indicated that SCD is a novel compound and that it could inhibit the growth of some tested bacterial strains with the MIC of 2mg/ml, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Moreover, no obvious toxicity has been found on cultured HUVEC cells with different concentrations of SCD at 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/ml.
TI  - Banana peel extract mediated synthesis of gold nanoparticles.
AB  - Gold nanoparticles were synthesized by using banana peel extract (BPE) as a simple, non-toxic, eco-friendly 'green material'. The boiled, crushed, acetone precipitated, air-dried peel powder was used to reduce chloroauric acid. A variety of nanoparticles were formed when the reaction conditions were altered with respect to pH, BPE content, chloroauric acid concentration and temperature of incubation. The reaction mixtures displayed vivid colors and UV-vis spectra characteristic of gold nanoparticles. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies revealed that the average size of the nanoparticles under standard synthetic conditions was around 300nm. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) confirmed these results. A coffee ring phenomenon, led to the aggregation of the nanoparticles into microcubes and microwire networks towards the periphery of the air-dried samples. X-ray diffraction studies of the samples revealed spectra that were characteristic for gold. Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated the involvement of carboxyl, amine and hydroxyl groups in the synthetic process. The BPE mediated nanoparticles displayed efficient antimicrobial activity towards most of the tested fungal and bacterial cultures.
TI  - Coliform accumulation in Amphibalanus amphitrite (Darwin, 1854) (Cirripedia) and  its use as an organic pollution bioindicator in the estuarine area of Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil.
AB  - Samples of water and barnacles Amphibalanus amphitrite were collected from Recife, Brazil, to assess if it accumulates total (TC) and thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) related with sewage pollution. The Most Probable Number (MPN) values and the standard procedures for examination of shellfish were used. Comparatively with the water samples, the highest coliform values came from the barnacles, with TC values ranging from < 3.0 x 10(3) to > 2.4 x 10(6) MPN.g-1, and TTC ranging from > 2.4 x 10(3) to 2.9 x 10(5) MPN.g-1. Barnacles accumulate the TC Ewingella americana, and the TTC Escherichia coli, Enterobacter gergoviae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter sakazakii. The results provided an indication of the level of organic contamination at the sampling locations and that this species could be a good organic pollution bioindicator.
TI  - Mutagenesis of Klebsiella aerogenes UreG to probe nickel binding and interactions with other urease-related proteins.
AB  - UreG is a GTPase required for assembly of the nickel-containing active site of urease. Herein, a Strep-tagged Klebsiella aerogenes UreG (UreG(Str)) and selected site-directed variants of UreG(Str) were constructed for studying the in vivo effects on urease activation in recombinant Escherichia coli cells, characterizing properties of the purified proteins, and analysis of in vivo and in vitro protein-protein interactions. Whereas the Strep tag had no effect on UreG's ability to activate urease, enzyme activity was essentially abolished in the K20A, D49A, C72A, H74A, D80A, and S111A UreG(Str) variants, with diminished activity also noted with E25A, C28A, and S115A proteins. Lys20 and Asp49 are likely to function in binding/hydrolysis of GTP and binding of Mg, respectively. UreG(Str) binds one nickel or zinc ion per monomer (K(d) approximately 5 microM for each metal ion) at a binding site that includes Cys72, as shown by a 12-fold increased K(d) for nickel ions using C72A UreG(Str) and by a thiolate-to-nickel charge-transfer band that is absent in the mutant protein. Based on UreG homology to HypB, a GTPase needed for hydrogenase assembly, along with the mutation results, His74 is likely to be an additional metal ligand. In vivo pull-down assays revealed Asp80 as critical for stabilizing UreG(Str) interaction with the UreABC-UreDF complex. In vitro pull-down assays demonstrated UreG binding to UreE, with the interaction enhanced by nickel or zinc ions. The metallochaperone UreE is suggested to transfer its bound nickel to UreG in the UreABC-UreDFG complex, with the metal ion subsequently transferring to UreD and then into the nascent active site of urease in a GTP-dependent process.
TI  - [Clinical assessment of novel ChromID ESBL agar plates for detection of ESBL producers in the family Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producers in the family Enterobacteriaceae are recognized worldwide as nosocomial pathogens, however it is difficult to screen them in the routine laboratory processing. ChromID ESBL agar newly developed for screening ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was released in Japan in April, 2007. We evaluated the clinical assessment of ChromID ESBL agar in routine microbiology laboratory. The 47 strains investigated were clinical isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae with the MICs of cefpodoxime greater than 2 mug/ml. The 27 ESBL-producers examined were comprising of 19 Escherichia coli, 3 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 3 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 S. marcescens (ESBL group) and 20 ESBL non-producers consiating of 5 K. oxytoca, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 P. vlugaris, 2 Serratia marcescens, 8 C. freundii, 2 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 E. aerogenes (non-ESBL group). Characterization of beta-lactamase genes was carried out by use of polymerase chain reaction. As the results, the sensitivity and the specificity of ChromID ESBL agar plates after incubation for 18 hours was 100% and 20%, respectively. It should be noted that the values of specificity was extremely low compared with those of the sensitivity. These findings clearly suggested that in cases of utilizing ChromID ESBL agar plates, it should be important to consider its characteristic properties, as even the ESBL-non-producers could grow on these media only when they were resistant to CPDX.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocin-like substances producing bacteria from finished cattle-manure compost and activity evaluation against some food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - A finished compost sample was examined for bacteriocin-like substance production  against five pathogenic bacteria: Salmonella typhimurium EF 85-9, Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43888, Enterococcus faecalis JCM 8726, Staphylococcus aureus JCM 2151, and Yersinia enterocolitica JCM 7577. At the preliminary detection of bacterial strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity from the compost sample, thirteen strains could be isolated. Screening of the inhibitory activity was done using agar-well diffusion assay and Microtiter plate growth assay. Six bacterial strains from the compost showed an antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested indicator strains. Four strains (M1-M4) belonged to Shigella species and the other two strains (M5 and M6) belonged to Salmonella species. The antimicrobial activity was sensitive for alpha-chymotrypsin and papain. The antimicrobial substances from M3, M4 and M6 were heat stable when heated for 15 min at 121 degrees C with 100% relative activity. The bacteriocin-like substance produced by strain M2 was partially characterized. It exhibited an inhibitory activity against the tested food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, except Enterobacter aerogenes JCM 1235 and Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum JCM 1149. It was stable at a wide range of pH (3-11). There was no loss of activity for up to 3 weeks when stored at 4 and -20 degrees C or for up to 2 weeks when stored at 28 and -80 degrees C. This is the first report indicating the presence of bacteriocin-like activity in animal manure compost.
TI  - The role of bioactive substances in controlling foodborne pathogens derived from  Metasequoia glyptostroboides Miki ex Hu.
AB  - In an attempt to isolate bioactive substances, ethyl acetate cone extract of Metasequoia glyptostroboides was subjected to a column chromatographic analysis that resulted in isolation of an abietane type diterpenoid, taxoquinone. Its structure was elucidated by spectroscopic means. In further, taxoquinone showed potential antibacterial effect as diameters of zones of inhibition against foodborne pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19166, Salmonella typhimurium KCTC 2515, Salmonella enteritidis KCTC 2021, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 43888, Enterobacter aerogenes KCTC2190, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and S. aureus KCTC 1916, which were found in the range of 10.6-15.8mm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of taxoquinone against the employed bacterial pathogens were found in the range of 62.5-250 and 125-500 microg/ml. Also the compound had strong antibacterial effect on the viable counts of the tested bacteria. Further, scanning electron microscopic study demonstrated potential detrimental effect of taxoquinone on the morphology of E. coli ATCC 8739. These findings indicate that bioactive compound taxoquinone present in M. glyptostroboides could be used as a promising antibacterial agent in food industry to inhibit the growth of certain important foodborne pathogens.
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis due to gram-negative bacilli in adults].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gram-negative bacilli are causative agents of bacterial meningitis  in the neonatal period but rarely cause meningitis in adults without risk factors. AIM: To report on meningitis due to gram-negative bacilli (MGNB) in adults diagnosed in a hospital over a 25-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients with an age > or = 14 years who had been diagnosed with MGNB between 1982 and 2006. RESULTS: Fifteen cases of MGNB are included (10.5% of the cases of bacterial meningitis with an identified aetiology), with a mean age of 48 years (14-79). Twelve (80%) were post-operative: recent neurosurgery (9 cases, 75%) and having a neurosurgical device (8 cases, 67%) were risk factors. Three (20%) were spontaneous: two were of a urinary origin and one had an undetermined origin. The aetiology was: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3 cases), Escherichia coli (3 cases), Enterobacter aerogenes (2 cases), Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 case), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 case), Morganella morganii (1 case), Acinetobacter anitratus (1 case), Acinetobacter iwoffii (1 case) and Flavobacterium brevis (1 case); in one patient with Gram positive staining for gram-negative bacilli, the culture was negative, and three of them (20%) were mixed infections (Staphylococcus spp.). Three patients (20%) died. CONCLUSIONS: In adults, gram-negative bacilli rarely cause spontaneous meningitis, but are a common causation of post-neurosurgical meningitis and in those with neurosurgical devices. The mortality rate of MGNB is high.
TI  - A highly sensitive detection platform based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering  for Escherichia coli enumeration.
AB  - A very sensitive and highly specific heterogeneous immunoassay system, based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and gold nanoparticles, was developed for the detection of bacteria and other pathogens. Two different types of gold nanoparticles (citrate-stabilized gold nanosphere and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-stabilized gold nanorod particles) were examined and this immunoassay was applied for the detection of Escherichia coli. Raman labels were constructed by using these spherical and rod-shaped gold nanoparticles which were first coated with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and subsequently with a molecular recognizer. The working curve was obtained by plotting the intensity of the SERS signal of the symmetric NO(2) stretching of DTNB at 1,333 cm(-1) versus the concentration of the E. coli. The analytical performance of gold particles was evaluated via a sandwich immunoassay, and linear calibration graphs were obtained in the E. coli concentration range of 10(1)-10(5) cfu/mL with a 60-s accumulation time. The sensitivity of the Raman label fabricated with gold nanorods was more than three times higher than spherical gold nanoparticles. The selectivity of the developed sensor was examined with Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter dissolvens, which did not produce any significant response. The usefulness of the developed immunoassay to detect E. coli in real water samples was also demonstrated.
TI  - Evaluation of efflux activity of bacteria by a semi-automated fluorometric system.
AB  - A semi-automated method that uses the common efflux pump (EP) substrate ethidium  bromide (EB) is described for the assessment of EP systems of bacteria. The method employs the Rotor-Gene(TM) 3000 thermocycler (Corbett Research) for the real-time assessment of accumulation and efflux of EB in Phosphate-Buffered Solution (PBS) under varying physiological conditions, such as temperature, pH, presence and absence of the energy source, and presence of efflux pumps inhibitors (EPIs). The method is sufficiently sensitive to characterize intrinsic EP systems of reference strains, a prime necessity if there is a need for assessment of EP-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR). The method has been successfully applied by us to characterize intrinsic and over-expressed EP systems of Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium avium, suggesting that if the organism can be maintained in PBS, the system described may suffice for the evaluation and assessment of its EP system.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an Italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  - The emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. Producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents around Bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. All routine Enterobacteriaceae isolates from a Bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for MBLs, with case details reviewed for the source patients. In total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 Escherichia coli, six Klebsiella pneumoniae, four Klebsiella oxytoca, four Citrobacter freundii, two Enterobacter cloacae and two Morganella morganii, as well as single Citrobacter amalonaticus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia stuartii and Proteus mirabilis isolates. All were PCR-positive for bla(VIM) and 25 were PCR-positive for qnrS; 19 non-K. pneumoniae had bla(SHV) and one had bla(CTX-M-group1); 13 were from 12 LTCF residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. All these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or LTCF stay; only seven had infections due to the MBL producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. Five patients had more than one MBL-producing organism. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related E. coli, whereas pairs of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. Transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be PCR-positive for bla(VIM), qnrS and bla(SHV); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(VIM-1), qnrS1 and bla(SHV-12) were detected by sequencing.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Leaves of Cadaba trifoliata (Roxb.) Wt. & Arn.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of aqueous and ethanol leaf extracts of Cadaba trifoliata  was evaluated by cup plate method against bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia and Escherichia coli. The ethanol extract of the leaves demonstrated a high degree of activity against all the tested bacterial strains except Erwinia and Acinetobacter, whereas the aqueous extract of the leaves showed moderate activity against E. coli, B. subtilis and Staph. aureus and Enterobacter aerogenes.
TI  - Characterization of the Klebsiella aerogenes urease accessory protein UreD in fusion with the maltose binding protein.
AB  - Assembly of the Klebsiella aerogenes urease metallocenter requires four accessory proteins, UreD, UreE, UreF, and UreG, to effectively deliver and incorporate two Ni2+ ions into the nascent active site of the urease apoprotein (UreABC). Each accessory protein has been purified and characterized with the exception of UreD due to its insolubility when it is overproduced in recombinant cells. In this study, a translational fusion was made between the maltose binding protein (MBP) and UreD, with the resulting MBP-UreD found to be soluble in Escherichia coli cell extracts and able to complement a DeltaureD-urease cluster in this host microorganism. MBP-UreD was purified as a large multimer (> 670 kDa) that bound approximately 2.5 Ni2+ ions (K(d) of approximately 50 microM, where K(d) is the dissociation constant) per UreD protomer according to equilibrium dialysis measurements. Zn2+ directly competes with 10-fold higher affinity (approximately 4 Zn2+ ions per protomer; K(d) of 5 microM) for the Ni2+ binding sites. MBP pulldown experiments demonstrated that the UreD domain of MBP-UreD formed in vivo complexes with UreF, UreG, UreF plus UreG, or UreABC when these proteins were overproduced in the same E. coli cells. In addition, a UreABC-(MBP-UreD)-UreFG complex was observed in cells producing all urease components. Comparative in vitro binding experiments with purified proteins demonstrated an approximate 1:1 binding ratio between the UreD domain of MBP-UreD and the UreF domain of the UreEF fusion, only weak or transient interaction between MBP-UreD and UreG, and no binding with UreABC. These studies are the first to describe the properties of purified UreD, and they extend our understanding of its binding partners both in vitro and in the cell.
TI  - Efflux pumps are involved in the defense of Gram-negative bacteria against the natural products isobavachalcone and diospyrone.
AB  - The activities of two naturally occurring compounds, isobavachalcone and diospyrone, against documented strains and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial isolates were evaluated. The results indicated that the two compounds exhibited intrinsic antibacterial activity against several Gram-negative bacteria, and their activities were significantly improved in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor (MIC values decreased to below 10 microg/ml). In addition, the activities of isobavachalcone and diospyrone against various strains exhibiting deletions of the major efflux pump components (AcrAB, TolC) were significantly increased. The overall results indicate that isobavachalcone and diospyrone could be candidates for the development of new drugs against MDR strains and that their use in combination with efflux pump inhibitors reinforces their activity.
TI  - Patterns of antimicrobial therapy in severe nosocomial infections: empiric choices, proportion of appropriate therapy, and adaptation rates--a multicentre, observational survey in critically ill patients.
AB  - This prospective, observational multicentre (n=24) study investigated relationships between antimicrobial choices and rates of empiric appropriate or adequate therapy, and subsequent adaptation of therapy in 171 ICU patients with severe nosocomial infections. Appropriate antibiotic therapy was defined as in vitro susceptibility of the causative pathogen and clinical response to the agent administered. In non-microbiologically documented infections, therapy was considered adequate in the case of favourable clinical response <5 days. Patients had pneumonia (n=127; 66 ventilator-associated), intra-abdominal infection (n=23), and bloodstream infection (n=21). Predominant pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=29) Escherichia coli (n=26), Staphylococcus aureus (n=22), and Enterobacter aerogenes (n=21). In 49.6% of infections multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were involved, mostly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (EBSL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and MDR non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria. Prior antibiotic exposure and hospitalisation in a general ward prior to ICU admission were risk factors for MDR. Empiric therapy was appropriate/adequate in 63.7% of cases. Empiric schemes were classified according to coverage of (i) ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria ("meropenem-based"), (ii) non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria (schemes with an antipseudomonal agent), and (iii) first-line agents not covering ESBL-Enterobacteriaceae nor non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria. Meropenem-based schemes allowed for significantly higher rates of appropriate/adequate therapy (p<0.001). This benefit remained when only patients without risk factors for MDR were considered (p=0.021). In 106 patients (61%) empiric therapy was modified: in 60 cases following initial inappropriate/inadequate therapy, in 46 patients in order to refine empiric therapy. In this study reflecting real-life practice, first-line use of meropenem provided significantly higher rates of the appropriate/adequate therapy, irrespective of presence of risk factors for MDR.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Artemisia nilagirica leaf extracts against clinical and phytopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The six organic solvent extracts of Artemisia nilagirica were screened for the potential antimicrobial activity against phytopathogens and clinically important standard reference bacterial strains. METHODS: The agar disk diffusion method was used to study the antibacterial activity of A. nilagirica extracts against 15 bacterial strains. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the plant extracts were tested using two fold agar dilution method at concentrations ranging from 32 to 512 microg/ml. The phytochemical screening of extracts was carried out for major phytochemical derivatives in A. nilagirica. RESULTS: All the extracts showed inhibitory activity for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The hexane extract was found to be effective against all phytopathogens with low MIC of 32 microg/ml and the methanol extract exhibited a higher inhibition activity against Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhi, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (64 microg/ml) and Shigella flaxneri (128 microg/ml). The phytochemical screening of extracts answered for the major derivative of alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids, phenol, quinines, tannins and terpenoids. CONCLUSION: All the extracts showed antibacterial activity against the tested strains. Of all, methanol and hexane extracts showed high inhibition against clinical and phytopathogens, respectively. The results also indicate the presence of major phytochemical derivatives in the A. nilagirica extracts. Hence, the isolation and purification of therapeutic potential compounds from A. nilagirica could be used as an effective source against bacterial diseases in human and plants.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Trends in antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from blood in Jakarta from 2002 to 2008.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined the susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream to antimicrobials with the aim of providing information relevant to the guidance of therapy. METHODOLOGY: Blood specimens received by the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, from 2002 to 2008, were analyzed for the presence of Gram-negative bacteria and their susceptibility to four antibiotic groups frequently administered in hospitals and community settings. RESULTS: During the seven-year period leading up to 2008, approximately 68% of Gram-negative bacteria were identified among all positive isolates from blood specimens. The eight most frequent species found were Acinetobacter anitratus (25.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (14.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (8%), Salmonella Typhi (7.5%), Escherichia coli (6.2%), Alcaligenes faecalis (5.6%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (3.2%). At 80% susceptibility or greater, Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime were active only on E. coli and S. Typhi. Cefepime demonstrated activity on all eight species tested except K. pneumonia while Amikacin showed activity against five species, A. faecalis, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and S. Typhi. Gentamycin was active against three species: E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca and S. Typhi. Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin significantly differed in their spectrum: while Ciprofloxacin was active against four of the eight species tested (E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. oxytoca, and S. Typhi ), Levofloxacin was similar to Cefepime and was active against all eight species except K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Since antimicrobials are broadly used in Jakarta, it is important that the information captured in this study be disseminated.
TI  - Method to detect only viable cells in microbial ecology.
AB  - Propidium monoazide can limit the analysis of microbial communities derived from  genetic fingerprints to viable cells with intact cell membranes. However, PMA treatment cannot completely suppress polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification when the targeted gene is too short. PMA treatment in combination with two-step nested PCR was designed to overcome this problem. Four experiments were performed to determine the limitation of PMA treatment and to evaluate the suitability of the method by applying the following samples: (1) pure cultures of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Alcaligenes faecalis; (2) pond water samples spiked with heat-killed E. coli O157:H7 and E. aerogenes; (3) anaerobic sludge samples exposed to increasing heat stress; and (4) selected natural samples of estuarine sediment and lake mud. Results from the first two experiments show that PMA treatment cannot efficiently suppress dead cells from PCR amplification when the targeted gene is as short as 190 bp, however, the two-step nested PCR can overcome this problem. The last two experiments indicate the method that PMA treatment in combination with two-step nested PCR is useful for viable cells detection in microbial ecology.
TI  - Transfer of a phage T4 gene into Enterobacteriaceae, determined at the single-cell level.
AB  - The transfer range of phage genes was investigated at the single-cell level by using an in situ DNA amplification technique. After absorption of phages, a phage T4 gene was maintained in the genomes of non-plaque-forming bacteria at frequencies of 10(-2) gene copies per cell. The gene transfer decreased the mutation frequencies in nonhost recipients.
TI  - Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of volatiles obtained by four different techniques from Salvia rosifolia Sm., and evaluation for biological activity.
AB  - Four different isolation techniques, conventional hydrodistillation (HD), microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MWHD), microdistillation (MD) and micro-steam distillation-solid-phase microextraction (MSD-SPME), have been used to analyze the volatile constituents from the aerial parts of Salvia rosifolia Sm. by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. HD and MWHD techniques produced quantitatively (yield, 0.39% and 0.40%) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar essential oils. alpha-Pinene (15.7-34.8%), 1,8-cineole (16.6-25.1%), beta-pinene (6.7-13.5%), beta-caryophyllene (1.4-5.0%) and caryophyllene oxide (1.4-4.4%) were identified as major constituents of this Turkish endemic species. Besides, the hydrodistilled oil of S. rosifolia was evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. The hydrodistilled oil of S. rosifolia showed antibacterial activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with a MIC value of 125microg/mL. Other human pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans) were also inhibited within a moderate range (MIC=125-1000microg/mL). Antifungal activity of the oil was also observed against the strawberry anthracnose-causing fungal plant pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum, C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides. No cytotoxicity was observed for S. rosifolia oil up to 25mg/mL against malignant melanoma, epidermal, ductal and ovary carcinoma.
TI  - Reconstruction of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from Duganella sp. B2 in different heterologous hosts.
AB  - Violacein is a bacteria-originated indolocarbazole pigment with potential applications due to its various bioactivities such as anti-tumor, antiviral, and antifungal activities. However, stable mass production of this pigment is difficult due to its low productivities and the instability of wild-type violacein-producing strains. In order to establish a stable and efficient production system for violacein, the violacein synthesis pathway from a new species of Duganella sp. B2 was reconstructed in different bacterial strains including Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes by using different vectors. The gene cluster that encodes five enzymes involved in the violacein biosynthetic pathway was first isolated from Duganella sp. B2, and three recombinant expression vectors were constructed using the T7 promoter or the alkane-responsive promoter PalkB. Our results showed that violacein could be stably synthesized in E. coli, C. freundii, and E. aerogenes. Interestingly, we found that there were great differences between the different recombinant strains, not only in the protein expression profiles pertaining to violacein biosynthesis but also in the productivity and composition of crude violacein. Among the host strains tested, the crude violacein production by the recombinant C. freundii strain reached 1.68 g L(-1) in shake flask cultures, which was 4-fold higher than the highest production previously reported in flask culture by other groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficient production of violacein by genetically engineered strains.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of pre-cut fruits sold in Kano metropolis, Kano State, Nigeria.
AB  - One hundred and fifty (150) pre-cut fruit samples comprising of Pineapples (50),  Paw-paw (50) and Watermelon (50) at the point of stand retail outlets were tested by standard bacteriological methods to determine bacterial contamination of the fruits. Out of these 150 examined 136 (90.67%) were contaminated with bacteria. The bacterial distribution were; Escherichia coli 69 (46.00%), Staphylococcus aureus 29 (19.33%), Salmonella species 13 (8.67%), Proteus species 18 (12.00%), Enterobacter aerogenes 3 (2.00%), Klebsiella pneumoniae 2 (1.33%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 (1.33%). Among the 50 Pineapple pre-cuts, Escherichia coli 26 (17.33%), Staphylococcus aureus 6 (4.00%), Salmonella species 7 (4.67%), Proteus species 9 (6.00%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 (1.33%); the 50 Watermelon had Escherchia coli 22 (14.67%), Staphylococcus aureus 13 (8.67%), Salmonella species 3 (2.00%), Proteus species 5 (3.33%), Enterobacter aerogenes 2 (1.33%), Klebsiella species 2 (1.33%). Of the 50 Paw-paw pre-cuts were: Escherichia coli 21 (14.00%), Staphylococcus aureus 10 (6.67%), Salmonella species 3 (2.00%), Proteus species 4 (2.67%), Enterobacter aerogenes 1 (0.67%) were isolated. The findings in this study have shown that the food vendors failed to adopt adequate hygiene for food handling and thus, suggest that the quality of all the pre-cut fruits sold at the retail outlets were not bacteriologically satisfactory. The public health risks associated with these pre-cut fruits may suggest that these fruits could serve as the vehicles for foodborne illnesses. This study has shown the need to educate the vendors on how to protect utensils and fruits to avoid contamination and spoilage.
TI  - International spread and persistence of TEM-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an IncA/C2 plasmid containing Tn1696::Tn1 and IS5075-Tn21.
AB  - TEM-24 remains one of the most widespread TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among Enterobacteriaceae. To analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative TEM-24 producers from Belgium, France, Portugal, and Spain (13 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 Escherichia coli isolates, 6 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 Proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). Clonal relatedness (XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] and E. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. Plasmid analysis included determination of the incompatibility group (by PCR, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns. Characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (Tn3, Tn21, and Tn402). Similar PFGE patterns were identified among E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates, while E. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups A, B2, and D). Highly related 180-kb IncA/C2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. Each plasmid contained defective In0-Tn402 (dfrA1-aadA1, aacA4, or aacA4-aacC1-orfE-aadA2-cmlA1) and In4-Tn402 (aacA4 or dfrA1-aadA1) variants. These integrons were located within Tn21, Tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with IS5075 interrupting their IRtnp and IRmer. In all cases, blaTEM-24 was part of an IS5075-DeltaTn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blaTEM-2 and blaTEM-3 variants. The international dissemination of TEM-24 is fuelled by an IncA/C2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. This work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of TEM-2 ESBL derivatives.
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - Novel cyclic hexapeptides from marine-derived fungus, Aspergillus sclerotiorum PT06-1.
AB  - Two novel cyclic hexapeptides containing both anthranilic acid and dehydroamino acid units, sclerotides A (1) and B (2), were isolated from the marine-derived halotolerant Aspergillus sclerotiorum PT06-1 in a nutrient-limited hypersaline medium. Both 1 and 2 are photointerconvertible and could be interconverted via a radical reaction initiated by direct photoisomerization. Both compounds showed moderate antifungal activity. Compound 2 also showed weak cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) fruits from different regions.
AB  - Structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) obtained from different regions (Germany, India, and Turkey). The main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. It was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. The highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from Turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from Germany and India was higher than that of Kefe cumin fruits obtained from Turkey. The fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris (FMC 1), Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus (FMC 19), Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7965), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 15753), Klebsiella pneumoniae (FMC 5), Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes (CCM 2531) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
TI  - Isolation of Salmonella and Shigella from fish harvested from the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria, Kenya.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human infections caused by pathogens transmitted from fish are quite  common. The aim of this study was to isolate enteric pathogenic bacteria from fish that might be transmitted to humans after the handling or consumption of such fish. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and twenty Nile tilapia fish harvested using various fishing methods were collected from fishermen in five fish landing beaches within Winam Gulf and disinfected externally using 70% ethyl alcohol for 2 minutes then washed three times with autoclaved distilled water. Isolation of Salmonella and Shigella species from fish samples was performed using standard bacteriological procedures. Five milliliters of each fish tissue slurry was microbiologically analyzed for any Enterobacteriaceae. Twelve Nile tilapia collected from three open-air markets were analyzed for Enterobacteriaceae comparison as controls. Identification of Salmonella by using housekeeping genes and species-specific primers was performed. RESULTS: Among 120 Nile tilapia, 63 (52.5%) were infected with Enterobacteriaceae. Out of these, 25 (39.7%) were Shigella spp, 9 (14.3%) Salmonella typhimurium, 7 (11.1%) S. typhi, 4 (6.3%) S. enteritidis, 16 (25.4%) Escherichia coli, 1 (1.6%) Proteus spp. and Enterobacter aerogenes respectively. Ten fish collected from open-air markets yielded E. coli (50%), S. typhimurium (20%), S. paratyphi (10%) and S. typhi (20%). CONCLUSION: Nile tilapia within Winam Gulf are infected by human enteric pathogens. Shigella spp., Salmonella and E. coli were the most frequently isolated, an indication that the beaches may be contaminated by untreated municipal sewage, runoff, and storm-water. S. typhimurium, S. typhi and S. enteritidis were the most common Salmonella isolates.
TI  - Biological properties of the Chilean native moss Sphagnum magellanicum.
AB  - An ethanol extract prepared from the gametophyte Chilean native moss Sphagnum magellanicum was dried out, weighed and dissolved in distilled water. This extract was then assayed for its antibacterial activity against the G(-) bacteria Azotobacter vinelandii, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, and the G(+) bacteria Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, and Streptococcus type beta. The growth of the cultures of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, and V. cholerae was inhibited at a concentration of 581 microg/ml of extract, while the cultures of E. coli, S. typhi and Streptococcus type beta were inhibited at a concentration of 1.16 microg/mL of extract. The concentration of phenolic compounds was 4.294 mg/mL; the presence of vanillic, chlorogenic, syringic, caffeic, gallic, 3-4 hydrozybenzoic, p-coumaric and salicylic acids was identified using RP- High Pressure Liquid Chromatography.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in Brazil.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. In this study, 127 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at Sao Paulo, Brazil, were submitted to analysis by PCR with specific primers for bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M genes. From the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) Escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%) Morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) Proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) Providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) Providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter cloacae were identified as ESBL producers. Bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. Pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of K. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. PCR results showed a high variety of ESBL groups among strains, in nine different species. The results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.
TI  - Chemical composition, antifungal and antibacterial activity of the essential oil  of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis from Spain.
AB  - The chemical composition of the oil of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach. has been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 34 compounds were identified representing more than 90% of the total oil. The oil was richer in monoterpenes than in sesquiterpenes, the major constituents being limonene (53.2%), 6-3-carene (21.0%) and a-pinene (12.2%). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the oil were also tested against Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp. and Serratia marcescens. Only two of these, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans, were sensitive to the treatment, inhibition zones of 11 and 14 mm diameter being obtained, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first report of the antifungal and antibacterial activity of this species.
TI  - Use of boronic acid disk tests to detect extended- spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of KPC carbapenemase-possessing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - We evaluated boronic acid (BA)-based methods for their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among clinical isolates of KPC-producing members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. A total of 155 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 141), Escherichia coli (n = 6), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 6), and Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2) genotypically confirmed to be KPC producers were analyzed. As many as 118 isolates harbored ESBLs (103 harbored SHV-type ESBLs, 13 harbored CTX-M-type ESBLs, and 2 harbored both SHV- and CTX-M-type ESBLs); the remaining 37 isolates were genotypically negative for ESBL production. The CLSI ESBL confirmatory test was positive for 79 of the 118 ESBL producers (sensitivity, 66.9%), while all 37 non-ESBL producers were negative (specificity, 100%). When a > or =5-mm increase in the zone diameter of either the cefotaxime (CTX)-clavulanate (CA) or the ceftazidime (CAZ)-CA disks containing BA compared with the zone diameter of the CTX or CAZ disks containing BA was considered to be a positive result for ESBL production, the method detected all 118 ESBL producers (sensitivity, 100%) and showed no false-positive results for non-ESBL producers (specificity, 100%). Double-disk synergy tests, in which disks of CTX, CAZ, aztreonam, or cefepime in combination with BA were placed at distances of 20, 25, and 30 mm (center to center) from a disk containing amoxicillin (amoxicilline)-clavulanate-BA, were able to detect 116 (98.3%), 101 (85.6%), and 28 (23.7%) of the ESBL-positive isolates, respectively; no false-positive results for non-ESBL-producing isolates were detected. Our results demonstrate that the modified CLSI ESBL confirmatory test with antibiotic disks containing BA is the most accurate phenotypic method for the detection of ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae producing KPC carbapenemases.
TI  - Genetic structure and distribution of the colibactin genomic island among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A genomic island encoding the biosynthesis and secretion pathway of putative hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide colibactin has been recently described in Escherichia coli. Colibactin acts as a cyclomodulin and blocks the eukaryotic cell cycle. The origin and prevalence of the colibactin island among enterobacteria are unknown. We therefore screened 1,565 isolates of different genera and species related to the Enterobacteriaceae by PCR for the presence of this DNA element. The island was detected not only in E. coli but also in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter koseri isolates. It was highly conserved among these species and was always associated with the yersiniabactin determinant. Structural variations between individual strains were only observed in an intergenic region containing variable numbers of tandem repeats. In E. coli, the colibactin island was usually restricted to isolates of phylogenetic group B2 and inserted at the asnW tRNA locus. Interestingly, in K. pneumoniae, E. aerogenes, C. koseri, and three E. coli strains of phylogenetic group B1, the functional colibactin determinant was associated with a genetic element similar to the integrative and conjugative elements ICEEc1 and ICEKp1 and to several enterobacterial plasmids. Different asn tRNA genes served as chromosomal insertion sites of the ICE-associated colibactin determinant: asnU in the three E. coli strains of ECOR group B1, and different asn tRNA loci in K. pneumoniae. The detection of the colibactin genes associated with an ICE-like element in several enterobacteria provides new insights into the spread of this gene cluster and its putative mode of transfer. Our results shed light on the mechanisms of genetic exchange between members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Magnetic circular dichroism study of a dicobalt(II) complex with mixed 5- and 6-coordination: a spectroscopic model for dicobalt(II) hydrolases.
AB  - The magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) study of [Co(2)(mu-OH)(mu-Ph(4)DBA)(TMEDA)(2)(OTf)], in which Ph(4)DBA is the dinucleating bis(carboxylate) ligand dibenzofuran-4,6-bis(diphenylacetate) and TMEDA is N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine, is presented. This complex serves as an excellent spectroscopic model for a number of dicobalt(II) enzymes and proteins that have both the mu-hydroxo, mu-carboxylato bridging and asymmetric 6- and 5-coordination. The low-temperature MCD spectrum of the model complex shows bands at 490, 504, and 934 nm arising from d-d transitions on the 6-coordinate Co(II) and bands at 471, 522, 572, 594, and 638 nm arising from d-d transitions on the 5-coordinate Co(II). The most intense MCD bands are at 504 and 572 nm for 6- and 5-coordinate Co(II), respectively, and these two bands are found in the MCD spectra of dicobalt(II)-substituted methionine aminopeptidase from Escherichia coli (CoCoMetAP), glycerophosphodiesterase from Enterobacter aerogenes (CoCoGpdQ), aminopeptidase from Aeromonas proteolytica (CoCoAAP), and myohemerythrin from Themiste zostericola (CoCoMyoHry). These dicobalt(II)-substituted proteins are known to have one 5- and one 6-coordinate Co(II) bridged by one or two carboxylates and either a water or a hydroxide. The uncertainty of the bridging water's state of protonation is problematic, as this is a likely candidate for the attacking nucleophile in the dimetallohydrolases. Analysis of the variable-temperature variable-field (VTVH) MCD data determined that the Co(II) ions in the model complex are ferromagnetically coupled with a J of 3.0 cm(-1). A comparison of all dicobalt(II) complexes and dicobalt(II)-substituted protein active sites with the mu-hydroxo/aqua, mu-carboxylato bridging motif reveals that J is either zero or negative (antiferromagnetic) in the mu-aqua systems and positive (ferromagnetic) in the mu-hydroxo systems. It was also determined that the Co(II) ions in CoCoAAP and CoCoMyoHry are ferromagnetically coupled, each with a J of 3.4 cm(-1), which suggests that these ions have a mu-hydroxo bridging ligand.
TI  - Association of the bla(CMY-10) gene with a novel complex class 1 integron carrying an ISCR1 element in clinical isolates from Korea.
AB  - The bla(CMY-10) gene responsible for beta-lactam resistance was located on a new  complex class 1 integron within a conjugative plasmid. The sul1-type class 1 integron, containing an aadA2a gene cassette, was identified upstream of bla(CMY-10). A unique gene array (yqgF-yqgE-gshB-orf97--orf105) was identified downstream of bla(CMY-10.).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Huge symbiotic organs in giant scale insects of the genus Drosicha (Coccoidea: Monophlebidae) harbor flavobacterial and enterobacterial endosymbionts.
AB  - Giant scale insects (Drosicha: Coccoldea: Monophlebidae) were investigated for their symbiotic organs and bacterial endosymbionts. Two types of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences, flavobacterial and enterobacterial, were consistently detected in D. corpulenta and D. pinicola. The former sequences formed a compact clade in the Bacteroidetes, allied to the symbionts of cushion and armored scales. The latter sequences formed a robust clade in the gamma-Proteobacteria, allied to enteric bacteria like Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Another type of 16S sequence derived from Wolbachia was also detected in D. pinicola. In-situ hybridization demonstrated that the flavobacterial and enterobacterial symbionts were localized in a pair of huge bacteriomes in the abdomen, the former in uninucleated peripheral bacteriocytes and the latter in syncytial central bacteriocytes. Electron microscopy confirmed the endocellular locations of the pleomorphic flavobacterial symbiont and the rod-shaped enterobacterial symbiont, and also revealed the location and fine structure of the Wolbachia symbiont in D. pinicola. Infection frequencies of the flavobacterial and enterobacterial symbionts were consistently 100% in populations of D. corpulenta and D. pinicola, while the Wolbachia symbiont exhibited 0% and 100% infection frequencies in D. corpulente and D. pinicola, respectively. Neither the flavobacterial symbiont nor the enterobacterial symbiont exhibited AT-biased nucleotide composition or accelerated molecular evolution. The huge bacteriomes of Drosicha giant scales would provide a useful system for investigating biochemical, physiological, and genomic aspects of the host-symbiont and symbiont-symbiont interactions.
TI  - Combining capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection for the analysis of Escherichia coli lysates.
AB  - With the goal of improving water quality control, in this study we combined CE-LIF for the analysis of Escherichia coli lysates under discontinuous conditions. Prior to injecting a large-volume protein sample, a plug of 0.2% w/v SDS was injected into the capillary filled with 2.0 M Tris-borate (TB) solution (pH 10.3). During the courses of the process stacking, proteins migrated against the electroosmotic flow (EOF) and entered a 1.7% w/v poly(ethylene oxide) solution that has been prepared in 200 mM TB (pH 9.0). The stacked proteins were then separated through sieving and then detected at the cathodic end. The use of TB solutions containing 0.01% w/v poly(ethylene oxide) was essential for the preparation of the protein samples and E. coli lysates to minimize the extent of protein adsorption on the capillary wall. Under the optimized CE-LIF conditions, we detected beta-Galactosidase with and without concentration at levels as low as 0.23 and 7.52 nM, respectively. Our approach allowed the detection of 3 x 10(2) E. coli cells based on the characteristic peaks of its lysates; in addition, we could detect the presence of 20 E. coli cells in a 50 mL sample of pond water within 24 h. In terms of the analyte migration time, the relative standard deviation of this CE-LIF method was less than 1.3%. We also extended the practicality of this technique by applying it to the separation of mixtures of E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Salmonella enterica.
TI  - Molecular identification of coliform bacteria from colicky breastfed infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of intestinal coliform bacteria in colicky vs healthy infants. STUDY DESIGN: We isolated coliform strains from faeces and performed quantitative bacterial cultures in 41 colicky and 39 healthy breastfed infants, identified using PCR with species-specific primers, strain-specific Automated Ribotyping and the API-50E kit for Enterobacteriaceae to identify the most frequent strains. RESULTS: Coliform strains were more abundant in colicky infants (median 6.04 log(10) CFU/g faeces, range 2.00-8.76) vs controls (median 4.47 log(10) CFU/g faeces, range 1.00-8.08) (p = 0.026). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes and Enterococcus faecalis were the predominant species in colicky and healthy infants. The counts of each bacterial species differed between the two groups, and the difference was significant (p = 0.002) for E. coli: median 6.30 log(10) CFU/g faeces (range 3.00-8.74) in colicky infants, and median 4.70 log(10) CFU/g faeces (range 2.00-5.85) in controls. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the colonization patterns of gas-forming coliforms in colicky infants and healthy controls identified by molecular methods. Coliform bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli, were found to be more abundant in colicky infants. Our data could help to shed light on the cause of infantile colic.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in vitro of Thymus capitatus from Jordan.
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the antibacterial activity of aqueous and  organic extracts of Thymus capitatus L. (Lamiaceae) leaves and stems. Dried ground powder leaves and stems were extracted with water (aqueous extracts), ethanol, dichloromethane and hexane (Soxhlet extracts). The antibacterial activity of these extracts was evaluated against bacteria using disc diffusion method. The result obtained showed that the leaves had stronger antibacterial activity than the stems extracts. The ethanolic extract had the highest yield products and the high antibacterial activity than all other solvents. The results suggest that essential oil as non-polar organic compounds could be the main active compounds in this plant. Therefore the antibacterial activity of leaves ethanol extracts (LEE) was compared with essential oils leaves extracts (LEO) of T. capitatus. The LEO showed greater antibacterial activity than LEE. The LEO showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most sensitive bacteria.
TI  - Incidence of multiple antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolated from surface and underground water sources in south western region of Nigeria.
AB  - In most rural and urban settlements, particularly in Nigeria, wells, spring, streams or rivers and lakes serves as major sources of water supply for drinking and other domestic purposes. Unfortunately, many of the available water sources are not potable without some form of treatment which is seldom available in most settings. The use of untreated surface water sources for drinking and for domestic purposes remains a major threat to public health as these could serve as reservoirs the for transfer of antibiotic resistant pathogens. The incidence of resistant bacteria isolated from surface and underground water in six rural settlements in Ekiti State Nigeria was thus investigated. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from wells, streams and boreholes in six rural settlements in Ekiti State Nigeria between January and April, 2006 and the prevalence of organisms exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, nitofurantoin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid and ofloxacin was observed. Gram-negative bacterial isolates comprised Escherichia coli (22.7%), Enterobacter aerogenes (2.5%), Salmonella spp. (13.3%), Shigella spp. (19.3%), Proteus spp. (18.5%), Klebsiella spp. (19.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.2%). Over 10% of the bacteria were resistant to four or more antibiotic. Antibiotic resistance was highest in members of the genera Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Proteus. Given the prevalence of appalling sanitary facilities and inappropriate public antibiotic use, the possibility of antibiotic resistance selection, faecal dissemination and subsequent contamination of local water sources available for rural residents of the developing world is highlighted. The implication for clinical practice of infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains especially among immunodeficient individuals is also discussed.
TI  - How beta-lactam antibiotics enter bacteria: a dialogue with the porins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections have become a major concern in  hospitals worldwide. This study investigates membrane translocation, which is the first step required for drug action on internal bacterial targets. beta-lactams, a major antibiotic class, use porins to pass through the outer membrane barrier of Gram-negative bacteria. Clinical reports have linked the MDR phenotype to altered membrane permeability including porin modification and efflux pump expression. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here influx of beta-lactams through the major Enterobacter aerogenes porin Omp36 is characterized. Conductance measurements through a single Omp36 trimer reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer allowed us to count the passage of single beta-lactam molecules. Statistical analysis of each transport event yielded the kinetic parameters of antibiotic travel through Omp36 and distinguishable translocation properties of beta-lactams were quantified for ertapenem and cefepime. Expression of Omp36 in an otherwise porin-null bacterial strain is shown to confer increases in the killing rate of these antibiotics and in the corresponding bacterial susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We propose the idea of a molecular "passport" that allows rapid transport of substrates through porins. Deciphering antibiotic translocation provides new insights for the design of novel drugs that may be highly effective at passing through the porin constriction zone. Such data may hold the key for the next generation of antibiotics capable of rapid intracellular accumulation to circumvent the further development MDR infections.
TI  - Biological activity of alkaloids from Solanum dulcamara L.
AB  - Alkaloids are well known for their antimicrobial activity. Though all natural alkaloids come from plants, not all plants produce alkaloids. Plants of the Solanaceae family are known for their high alkaloid content. Alkaloids are found in all plant parts like roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds. In the present study, those plant parts of Solanum dulcamara were selected which have been reported to produce a high content of a specific alkaloid: solanine (from unripe fruits), solasodine (from flowers) and beta-solamarine (from roots). These alkaloids were extracted from various parts of S. dulcamara by well-established methods and were screened for their antibacterial activity. Human pathogenic bacteria, viz., Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, were selected for the study. All three alkaloids inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus. However, no significant activity was observed against E. aerogenes. Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were also evaluated.
TI  - Novel CTX-M {beta}-lactamase genotype distribution and spread into multiple species of Enterobacteriaceae in Changsha, Southern China.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to undertake a survey of the occurrence of  CTX-M and SHV extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genotypes in Enterobacteriaceae from Hunan Province, China. METHODS: Clinical isolates (425) from three major hospitals in Changsha, Hunan Province, were collected between October 2004 and July 2005, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities of the genotype of bla(CTX-M) and bla(SHV) were determined. Random amplified polymorphic DNA was used to characterize the clonality of all of the isolates. RESULTS: The overall rate of ESBL-positive isolates was 33.4% (142/425). The dominant ESBLs were CTX-M types, and were found in 109/142 (76.8%) isolates comprising seven different genera/species, namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia stuartii. The most common bla(CTX-M) genotypes were bla(CTX-M-14) (47.7%), bla(CTX-M-3) (29.4%) and bla(CTX-M-15) (17.4%). A novel gene derived from bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-82) (Ala-40-->Pro), was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The dominant ESBL genotype in Hunan Province was bla(CTX-M). The high prevalence (17.4%) of bla(CTX-M-15) has not previously been reported from China. Our results identify that an epidemic of bla(CTX-M) in Changsha, Hunan Province, has evolved with the appearance and spread of bla(CTX-M-15) against the dominant genotypes bla(CTX-M-14) and bla(CTX-M-3.) The worldwide dominance of bla(CTX-M-15) could be poised to spread to China, displacing the current prevailing genotypes.
TI  - Synthesis, biological evaluation, mechanism of action and quantitative structure-activity relationship studies of chalcones as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Forty-eight chalcone analogs were synthesized and their in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus NCIM 5021, Bacillus subtilis NCIM 2718, Phaseolus vulgaris NCIM 2813, Escherichia coli NCIM 2931, Salmonella typhi 2501 and Enterobacter aerogenes NCIM 5139 were evaluated by microdilution broth assay. Quantitative structure-activity relationships were developed for all the cases (r(2) = 0.68-0.79; r(2)(adj) = 0.58-0.78; q(2) = 0.51-0.68; F = 13.02-61.51). Size, polarizability, electron-donating/withdrawing and hydrophilic nature of the molecule determine the activity against these Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus was the most and S. typhi was the least hydrophobic of these organisms. These chalcones act better against more hydrophobic organisms. The more active chalcones have log P between 1.5 and 3. Compound 24, one of the most active compounds, was found to act by damaging the cell wall of S. aureus. Slimicidal activity of five of the most active compounds (24, 31, 32, 34 and 37) was found to be in the range of 48-60% against S. aureus and 40-54% against E. coli. A correlation was observed among the hydrophobicity of the compounds, hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell surface and the antibacterial activity of the compound.
TI  - Geraniol restores antibiotic activities against multidrug-resistant isolates from gram-negative species.
AB  - The essential oil of Helichrysum italicum significantly reduces the multidrug resistance of Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Combinations of the two most active fractions of the essential oil with each other or with phenylalanine arginine beta-naphthylamide yield synergistic activity. Geraniol, a component of one fraction, significantly increased the efficacy of beta-lactams, quinolones, and chloramphenicol.
TI  - Role of TolC in Klebsiella oxytoca resistance to antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Gram-negative human pathogen Klebsiella oxytoca is often resistant to several antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and others. The aim of this study was to look at the mechanisms leading to this resistance and particularly the role of TolC and efflux mechanisms in determining resistance. METHODS: Ciprofloxacin accumulation was measured spectrofluorometrically. Growth inhibition assays were performed in the presence or absence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (10 mg/L, final concentration). The genome of K. oxytoca was analysed for the existence of loci encoding tolC by PCR using primers for the Enterobacter aerogenes tolC gene and subsequently sequenced. A plasmid named pUC18TolC was constructed and inserted into Escherichia coli C600tolC,Tn5, and the function of TolC was analysed. The structure modelling was performed using the Modeller program. RESULTS: The existence of the AcrAB efflux mechanism was demonstrated in the species, and a TolC-like protein, a channel-forming protein at the external membrane that allows the extrusion of antibiotics by the AcrAB efflux pump, was cloned, sequenced and a model proposed. CONCLUSIONS: K. oxytoca express a functional TolC that lacks a fragment of six amino acids characteristic of the external loops of TolC in E. coli. This makes this species resistant to a few colicins.
TI  - Isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from Raphanus sativus L.
AB  - Acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of Raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and resistant pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Total and individual isothiocyanate (ITC) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of R. sativus were also evaluated. Both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. Antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. Of the different parts of R. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different ITCs such as allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (MTBITC) in different parts of the plant. The low linear correlation between the total ITC content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of R. sativus was not dependent on the total ITC content. However, the antibacterial activity of R. sativus was well correlated with AITC, PITC, and BITC for all organisms except for Enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to MTBITC.
TI  - AmpC beta-lactamases.
AB  - SUMMARY: AmpC beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the Enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. In many bacteria, AmpC enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. Overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy. Transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for AmpC enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(AmpC) gene, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance due to plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. AmpC enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. Techniques to identify AmpC beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates this resistance mechanism. Carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to AmpC-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance efflux (efflux pump activation).
TI  - Screening of antibacterial potentials of some medicinal plants from Melghat forest in India.
AB  - Cyperus rotundus, Caesalpinia bonducella, Tinospora cordifolia, Gardenia gummifera, Ailanthus excelsa, Acacia arabica, Embelia ribes and Ventilago maderspatana from Melghat forest were screened for their antibacterial potential against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes by disc diffusion method. Out of these medicinal plants Caesalpinia bonducella, Gardenia gummifera and Acacia arabica showed remarkable antibacterial potential. The phytochemical analysis had showed the presence of Cardiac glycosides in all extracts (aqueous, acetone, ethanol and methanol) of Acacia arabica, Gardenia gummifera and ethanol, methanol extracts of Caesalpinia bonducella. Flavonoids were present in Gardenia gummifera, Ailanthus excelsa and acetone, methanol extracts of Acacia Arabica. Tannins and phenolic were present in Cyperus rotundus, Embelia ribes, and organic extracts of Ventilago maderspatana.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - [Detection of AmpC beta-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria isolated from urine].
AB  - AmpC beta-lactamases, enzymes produced by a range of Gram-negative bacteria and able to hydrolyse penicillins, monobactams, cephalosporins and cephamycins, are not inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors. They are spread via plasmids and pose a huge epidemiological and diagnostic problem. The production of AmpC B-lactamases was tested in various Gram-negative bacteria. Of strains isolated from urine of patients diagnosed with urinary tract infection, we selected those that were resistant to third generation cephalosporins and did not produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). The production of inducible AmpC was assayed by modified DDST (double disk synergy test) and that of constitutive AmpC was tested on agar containing oxacillin as an AmpC inhibitor. All constitutive AmpC producers were also tested for susceptibility to amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazon/sulbactam, imipenem, meropenem and colistin by the disk diffusion method on MH-agar. Altoghether 119 strains (68 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 20 strains of Escherichia coli and 12 strains of Enterobacter aerogenes) were tested. We detected 38 constitutive AmpC producers, including primarily K. pneumoniae (17 strains), E. coli (10 strains) and E. aerogenes (4 strains). Thirty-two strains were inducible AmpC producers (21 K pneumoniae strains, 6 Morganella morganii strains and 3 E. aerogenes strains). Two K. pneumoniae strains were ESBL/AmpC coproducers. The constitutive AmpC producers showed relatively good susceptibility to cefepim (84.2%) and carbapenems.
TI  - Microbiological and toxicological effects of Perla black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - We investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three Perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over Vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. Three different solvents were used to obtain Perla black bean extracts. All three Perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (IC(50)). Methanol Perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. All Perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes did not. Acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. The best IC(50) was observed for Giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The Vero cells toxicity levels (IC(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were [mean +/- S.D. (95% CI)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. In vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. The acetic acid and methanol Perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water Perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba hystolitica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The three Perla black bean extracts assayed over Vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol Perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - [Recent evolution and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteria in the CHU of Nice (2005-2007)].
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: ESBL producing enterobacteria (E-ESBL+) are always a public health concern, mainly due to increase of CTX-M beta-lactamase. So, 542 new strains were isolated in the CHU de Nice during the 2005-2007 period. The aim of this work was to characterize the ESBL and to type isolates suspected to be implicated in outbreaks. METHODS: Every first E-ESBL+ was studied, the antibiotype was defined by the agar diffusion technique. Type of ESBL was determined by PCR, followed by sequencing for CTX-M and SHV enzymes. Typing was performed when several strains of one species had same antibiotype and beta-lactamase. RESULTS: CTX-M type ESBL are predominant (45% of all E-ESBL+), mainly in Escherichia coli (34.5%). The TEM24 ESBL was the second predominant type (34.5%), mainly in Enterobacter aerogenes (18.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.4%). SHV5/12 ESBL was found mainly in Enterobacter cloacae (7.5%). Several epidemic situations were identified, with CTX-M15 in Escherichia coli (2005/2006: 27 patients), SHV5/12 in Enterobacter cloacae (2006: 10 patients) and TEM in Proteus mirabilis (2007: nine patients). Enterobacter aerogenes is still endemic (101 patients) while an epidemic clone of TEM24 producing K. pneumoniae persists especially in an intensive care unit (26 patients during the three years). CONCLUSION: Caracterization of E-ESBL+ is essential to better understand their mode of dissemination, monitor the emergence of new enzymes and adapt the efforts against BMR cross transmission.
TI  - Horizontol dissemination of TEM- and SHV-typr beta-lactamase genes-carrying resistance plasmids amongst clonical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria have been isolated at increasing frequency worldwide. Expression of ESBL is often associated with multidrug resistance and dissemination by resistance plasmids. During a two-month period in 2000, 133 clinical isolates of enterobacterial strains were randomly collected from outpatients and inpatients at a university hospital in Turkey. The ESBL producing strains were determined by double-disk synergy (DDS) testing. Twenty ESBL producing strains (15%) including Escherichia coli (n = 9), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2) and Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2) were detected and further analyzed for their resistance transfer features, plasmid profile and nature of the resistance genes. Plasmid transfer assays were performed using broth mating techniques. TEM- and SHV- genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization using specific probes. EcoRI restriction enzyme analyses of R plasmids were used in the detection of epidemic plasmids. Fourteen plasmid profiles (A, B1, B2, C1, and C2 to L) were obtained with EcoRI restriction enzyme analysis. Most of these plasmids were detected to carry both TEM- and SHV-derived genes by PCR, and confirmed by localizing each gene by hybridization assay. Epidemiological evidence indicated that there was an apparent horizontal dissemination of conjugative R plasmids among multidrug-resistant enterobacterial genera and species in this hospital.
TI  - Efficacy of plant essential oils against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria associated with ready-to-eat vegetables: antimicrobial and sensory screening.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils (EOs) against foodborne pathogens and key spoilage bacteria pertinent to ready-to-eat vegetables and to screen the selected EOs for sensory acceptability. The EOs basil, caraway, fennel, lemon balm, marjoram, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme were evaluated. The bacteria evaluated were Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus spp., Bacillus cereus, Salmonella, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas spp. Quantitative antimicrobial analyses were performed using an absorbance-based microplate assay. Efficacy was compared using MIC, the half maximum inhibitory concentration, and the increase in lag phase. Generally, gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to EOs than were gram-negative bacteria, and Listeria monocytogenes strains were among the most sensitive. Of the spoilage organisms, Pseudomonas spp. were the most resistant. Oregano and thyme EOs had the highest activity against all the tested bacteria. Marjoram and basil EOs had selectively high activity against B. cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, and Salmonella, and lemon balm and sage EOs had adequate activity against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus. Within bacterial species, EO efficacy was dependent on strain and in some cases the origin of the strain. On a carrot model product, basil, lemon balm, marjoram, oregano, and thyme EOs were deemed organoleptically acceptable, but only oregano and marjoram EOs were deemed acceptable for lettuce. Selected EOs may be useful as natural and safe additives for promoting the safety and quality of ready-to-eat vegetables.
TI  - Wound healing, anti-microbial and antioxidant potential of Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh.
AB  - Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh (Loranthaceae) of the order Santalales, is used ethnomedicinally for treating ulcers, asthma, impotence, paralysis, skin diseases, and wounds. In this context, validations of the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in wound healing activity was studied, besides anti-microbial activity and antioxidant activity were performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. The ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Dendrophthoe falcata ethanolic extract (DFEE) was investigated for the evaluation of its healing efficiency on excision and incision wound models in rats. The results showed that Dendrophthoe falcata extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expressions were also well correlative with the healing pattern observed. Three of the fractions A-C (petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol, respectively) obtained from the extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Serratia marcescens, and five fungi Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis: dimorphic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger: systemic fungi, and some infectious bacteria Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi. The results also indicated that DFEE possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase levels and increased the catalase activity.
TI  - Identification and evolution of drug efflux pump in clinical Enterobacter aerogenes strains isolated in 1995 and 2003.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high mortality impact of infectious diseases will increase due to accelerated evolution of antibiotic resistance in important human pathogens. Development of antibiotic resistance is a evolutionary process inducing the erosion of the effectiveness of our arsenal of antibiotics. Resistance is not necessarily limited to a single class of antibacterial agents but may affect many unrelated compounds; this is termed 'multidrug resistance' (MDR). The major mechanism of MDR is the active expulsion of drugs by bacterial pumps; the treatment of gram negative bacterial infections is compromised due to resistance mechanisms including the expression of efflux pumps that actively expel various usual antibiotics (beta-lactams, quinolones, ...). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Enterobacter aerogenes has emerged among Enterobacteriaceae associated hospital infections during the last twenty years due to its faculty of adaptation to antibiotic stresses. Clinical isolates of E. aerogenes belonging to two strain collections isolated in 1995 and 2003 respectively, were screened to assess the involvement of efflux pumps in antibiotic resistance. Drug susceptibility assays were performed on all bacterial isolates and an efflux pump inhibitor (PAbetaN) previously characterized allowed to decipher the role of efflux in the resistance. Accumulation of labelled chloramphenicol was monitored in the presence of an energy poison to determine the involvement of active efflux on the antibiotic intracellular concentrations. The presence of the PAbetaN-susceptible efflux system was also identified in resistant E. aerogenes strains. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: For the first time a noticeable increase in clinical isolates containing an efflux mechanism susceptible to pump inhibitor is report within an 8 year period. After the emergence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in E. aerogenes and the recent characterisation of porin mutations in clinical isolates, this study describing an increase in inhibitor-susceptible efflux throws light on a new step in the evolution of mechanism in E. aerogenes.
TI  - Membrane permeability and regulation of drug "influx and efflux" in enterobacterial pathogens.
AB  - In Enterobacteriaceae, membrane permeability is a key in the level of susceptibility to antibiotics. Modification of the bacterial envelope by decreasing the porin production or increasing the expression of efflux pump systems has been reported. These phenomena are frequently associated with other resistance mechanisms such as alteration of antibiotics or modification of the drug targets, in various clinical isolates showing a Multi Drug Resistant phenotype (MDR). In Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica several genes and external factors are involved in the emergence of MDR isolates. These bacterial isolates exhibit a noticeable reduction of functional porins per cell due to a decrease, a complete shutdown of synthesis, or the expression of an altered porin and a high expression of efflux systems (e.g. overexpression of the pump). The combined action of these mechanisms during an infection confers a significant decrease in bacterial sensitivity to antibiotherapy ensuring dissemination and colonization of the patient and favours the acquisition of additional mechanisms of resistance. MarA and ramA are involved in a complex regulation cascade controlling membrane permeability and actively participate in the triggering of the MDR phenotype. Mutations in regulator genes have been shown to induce the overproduction of efflux and the down-regulation of porin synthesis. In addition, various compounds such as salicylate, imipenem or chloramphenicol are able to activate the MDR response. This phenomenon has been observed both in vitro during culture of bacteria in the presence of drugs and in vivo during antibiotic treatment of infected patients. These effectors activate the expression of specific global regulators, marA, ramA, or target other genes located downstream in the regulation cascade.
TI  - NXL104 combinations versus Enterobacteriaceae with CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The beta-lactamase landscape is changing radically, with CTX-M types  now the most prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) worldwide, except maybe in the USA. In addition, there are growing numbers of Enterobacteriaceae with KPC and metallo-carbapenemases. We examined whether combinations of oxyimino-cephalosporins with NXL104, a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor, overcame these resistances. METHODS: NXL104 was tested at 4 mg/L in combination with cefotaxime and ceftazidime versus: (i) Escherichia coli transconjugants and wild-type Enterobacteriaceae with CTX-M ESBLs; (ii) Enterobacteriaceae with ertapenem resistance contingent on combinations of impermeability and ESBLs or AmpC; and (iii) Enterobacteriaceae with KPC, SME, metallo- or OXA-48 carbapenemases. RESULTS: MICs of cefotaxime + NXL104 were < or = 1 mg/L for most Enterobacteriaceae with CTX-M, KPC or OXA-48 enzymes and were < or = 2 mg/L for those that also had ertapenem resistance contingent on combinations of beta-lactamase and impermeability. MICs of the ceftazidime + NXL104 combination were < or = 4 mg/L, except for a single Enterobacter aerogenes with KPC and AmpC enzymes together with porin loss, which required an MIC of 32 mg/L. The major gap was that NXL104 could not potentiate cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae with IMP or VIM metallo-enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Oxyimino-cephalosporin + NXL104 combinations have potential against strains with the prevalent ESBLs and non-metallo-carbapenemases.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - Synthesis and in-vitro antibacterial activity of 5-substituted 1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazoles.
AB  - A series of 5-substituted 1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for in-vitro antibacterial activity against a panel of microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Helicobacter pylori using conventional agar dilution method. Among the test compounds, 1-methyl-4-nitro-5-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-imidazole was the most potent against Gram-positive bacteria, with a MIC value of < or =8 microg/mL. All compounds showed no significant activity against Gram-negative bacteria at concentrations < or =64 microg/mL. The MIC values against 15 clinical isolates of H. pylori indicated that compounds 10 and 11 were the most active compounds in this series in terms of inhibiting the growth of H. pylori (MIC = 2 microg/mL). It was also demonstrated that their corresponding activities were four times larger than that of metronidazole.
TI  - Combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin AS-48 for inactivation of Gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against Gram-negative bacteria. Although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on Salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at pH 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. Greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees C in an alkaline (pH 9.0) enterocin AS-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. Bactericidal activity against S. enterica increased greatly when enterocin AS-48 was used in washing solutions in combination with several chemical compounds: EDTA, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. The combined treatment of enterocin AS-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other Gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. The bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin AS-48 was confirmed in all cases. Combinations of enterocin AS-48 (25 microg/ml) and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of S. enterica, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees C and 15 degrees C. The combined treatment could therefore be applied to reduce the risks of Gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.
TI  - The culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  - AIM: Traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. AIM: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. METHODS: A cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. After surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. Identification of bacteria as well as computation of mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. Wilcoxon's paired and Chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. Positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (P<0.001). The microorganisms identified were Escherichia coli (14 cases) and Enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (P<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (P<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. CONCLUSION: The neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. This difference might be attributed to the presence of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the region.
TI  - Influence of extended-spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance.
AB  - PURPOSE: The influence of extended- spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance was studied. METHODS: Hospital pharmacists were asked to provide data on antimicrobial use and bacterial susceptibilities. Defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam were assessed for significant associations with gram-negative susceptibility. To account for midyear changes in usage patterns and the lag between changes in usage and resistance, susceptibility over two-year periods was evaluated. RESULTS: Susceptibility data of more than 300,000 gram-negative isolates, representing 10 species of interest, were provided by 82 U.S. hospitals. Two-year periods (n = 45) were evaluable for 25 hospitals, containing 159 hospital-years of data and 204,513 clinical isolates. Use of cefepime increased, while use of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam decreased. Excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteria were most susceptible to cefepime, followed by piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime. Significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics themselves were observed with ceftazidime (Enterobacter aerogenes) and ceftriaxone (Escherichia coli). Extended-spectrum beta-lactams associated with significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to other beta-lactams included cefepime (E. aerogenes and E. coli susceptibility to ceftazidime), ceftazidime (Enterobacter cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), ceftriaxone (E. cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), piperacillin-tazobactam (E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa susceptibility to cefepime). There were insufficient susceptibility data to allow for impact analysis for piperacillin-tazobactam. CONCLUSION: Use of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with variably changing susceptibilities of several key gram-negative bacteria, either to themselves or to each other. Despite the increased use of cefepime, gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cefepime remained high.
TI  - [Influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  - The influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, WalkAway-40 (Dade MicroScan, West Sacramento, CA, USA), VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo). In the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. For the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. Enterobacter cloacae plus Klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in K. ornithinolytica or E. aerogenes with 93% to 97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. Whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-producing Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (VR) and vancomycin-susceptible (VS) Enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. However, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, RAISUS required 70% of MRSA, VITEK 2 Compact was 8%, and the WalkAway-40 was 1%. Also, when the cell suspension of VS E. faecalis spiked with Proteus mirabilis was tested, the WalkAway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both VITEK 2 Compact and RAISUS reported as the test inoculum being VR E. faecalis. With these results, it can be concluded that: First, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. Secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from reporting very major error interpretation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and synergism of some substituted flavonoids.
AB  - Natural and synthetic substituted chalcones, flavones and flavanones were tested  for antibacterial activity. In order to determine synergism, new combinations of substituted flavonoids against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes were assayed. The results allow us to establish relationships between antimicrobial effect of the compounds and membrane structures of these microorganisms. When flavonoid combinations were employed a stronger effect was found against E. coli than against S. aureus. This fact is due to the existence of porins in the outer membrane of G(-)-bacteria. The compound that acts as enhancer acts by blocking the charges of amino acids in the porins and thus facilitates the passage of the other compound by diffusion into the bacterial cell.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some medicinal plant extracts.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of hot aqueous and methanolic extracts prepared from six plants (Terminallia chebula, Terminallia bellerica, Phyllanthus emblica, Punica granatum, Lawsonia alba and Mikania micrantha) used in traditional folk medicines of India were screened against five pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 2940, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441, Escherichia coli MTCC 739, Proteus vulgaris MTCC 426 and Enterobacter aerogenes MTCC 111). The highest antibacterial potentiality was exhibited by the methanolic leaf extract of T. chebula, followed by the aqueous fruit extract of T. bellerica. The leaf extract of T. chebula can be considered to be as equally potent as the most effective antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, kanamycin, ofloxacin and cephalexin. A sensitivity test performed with commonly used sensitivity test disks resulted in the appearance of multiple drug resistance phenotypes of the bacteria tested. A comparison of data in the inhibition zones of pathogenic bacteria showed that gentamycin, ofloxacin, kanamycin and tobramycin were effective against all of the bacterial strains tested.
TI  - Occurrence of ESBL & Amp-C beta-lactamases & susceptibility to newer antimicrobial agents in complicated UTI.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpC beta-lactamases are the most common mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in Gram negative bacilli. A prospective study was undertaken to know the occurrence of ESBL and AmpC producing strains and their antibiotic susceptibilities to newer agents to guide empirical therapy for complicated urinary tract infections. METHODS: Over a period of five months (January to May 2003), organisms grown in pure culture and in significant numbers from urine sample were identified by standard biochemical tests and antibiotic susceptibility determined by disc diffusion method. Gram-negative bacilli that were resistant to third generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin/amikacin were defined as highly drug resistant uropathogens (HDRU). HDRU were further tested for ESBL and AmpC phenotypes. RESULTS: Uropathogens were isolated in significant numbers in 1979 (21.8%) of the total 9,072 samples, of which 438(22.1%) were HDRU. Two hundred and five consecutive HDRU isolates were tested for ESBL production and 36.5 per cent were found to be ESBL producers. The highest positivity was found to be in Klebsiella spp. (51.2%), followed by Escherichia coli (40.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (33.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27.9%). Both ESBL producers and non producers showed a high degree resistance to piperacillin (93.1 and 90.9%), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (93.4 and 90.9%), aztreonam (79.4 and 78%), cefepime (76.7 and 78%), and ampicillin-sulbactam (76.7 and 70.4%). The most effective antibiotics for ESBL producers were imipenem (8.2% resistance), piperacillin-tazobactam (9.5%) and ceftazidime-clavulanic acid (23.2%). Among ESBL non-producers, piperacillin-tazobactam (31.06%), ceftazidime-clavulanic acid (49.2%) and imipenem (11%) were less effective when compared to ESBL producers. Fifty three piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam positive and 20 negative isolates were further tested for AmpC production and found that all 53 positive isolates were also positive by for AmpC beta-lactamase. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Overall, 22.1 per cent of our isolates were highly drug resistant, and ESBL producers could explain only 36.5 per cent of HDRU in our study. Therefore, we assume that AmpC beta-lactamases are more important in our setting. Based on our finding a test using discs containing piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam ( PtPc) disc at a distance of 20 mm would act as a useful screening procedure for AmpC production as AmpC beta-lactamase producers are more susceptible to tazobactam as compared to clavulanic acid.
TI  - Viper metalloproteinase (Agkistrodon halys pallas) with antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  - Metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. A 23.1 kDa protein was isolated from Agkistrodon halys (pallas, Chinese viper) snake venom. The toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an N-terminal sequence (MIQVLLVTICLAVFPYQGSSIILES) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the Viperidae family. The antibacterial effect of Agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (AHM) on Burkholderia pseudomallei (strains TES and KHW), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microM. Interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against S. aureus, P. vulgaris, P. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant B. pseudomallei (strain KHW) bacteria. AHM variants with high bacteriostatic activity (MIC 1.875-60 microM) also tended to be less cytotoxic against U-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mM concentrations. These results suggest that this metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.
TI  - Decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  Part II: new insights.
AB  - The second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. A simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast Candida albicans, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria sicca, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Gram-positive bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of Geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. A similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. Measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. Counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. Reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. The area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the Wartburg law depending on exposure time. Qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.
TI  - Succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a PCR-based approach.
AB  - The goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using PCR. In a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, PCR enabled detection of Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. Subsequently, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. Nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of Pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. PCR also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin A producers and accounted for the LAB succession in the fermenting samples. A total of 328 LAB isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which PCR could identify an overwhelming 186 Lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 Pediococcus and 29 Leuconostoc isolates, respectively. Based on antimicrobial assay against target strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B640, 28% of the LAB were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin A and mesentericin producers. The bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of Gram-positive target LAB strains and pathogenic bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the conjugative plasmid pOLA52, enhance biofilm formation and transfer frequencies in Enterobacteriaceae strains.
AB  - The conjugative plasmid pOLA52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other  antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. Screening of a transposon-mutagenized pOLA52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkABCDF operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. Biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pOLA52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. The conjugative transfer rate of pOLA52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. Through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be expressed as a single operon. Immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (MrkA)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. When transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhimurium, Kluyvera sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes, pOLA52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pOLA52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3 fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of the plasmid-harbouring strain.
TI  - E240V substitution increases catalytic efficiency toward ceftazidime in a new natural TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, TEM-149, from Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia marcescens clinical isolates.
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize a novel extended-spectrum beta-lactamase that belongs to the TEM family, the TEM-149 enzyme, and that was isolated from the urine of two hospitalized patients from different hospitals in southern Italy. The peculiarity of this enzyme was the finding of a valine residue at position 240. The array of amino acid substitutions found in TEM-149 was as follows: E104K, R164S, M182T, and E240V. A reversion of a threonine residue at position 182 was also performed to create a new mutant, TEM-149 T182M, in order to assess the contribution of this substitution on the kinetic profile and the stability of TEM-149. The bla TEM-149 and bla TEM-149/T182M genes were cloned into pBC-SK, and the corresponding enzymes were purified from recombinant Escherichia coli HB101 by the same procedure. Both enzymes hydrolyzed all beta-lactams tested, with a preference for ceftazidime, which was found to be the best substrate. By comparison of the kinetic parameters of the TEM-149 and the TEM-149 T182M enzymes, a reduction of the catalytic efficiency for the TEM-149 T182M mutant was observed against all substrates tested except benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime, and aztreonam. Tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam were good inhibitors of the TEM-149 beta-lactamase.
TI  - Nationwide study of the prevalence, characteristics, and molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in France.
AB  - Among 10,872 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from a nationwide study of 88 French  hospitals in 2005, 169 (1.7%) expressed an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. The most prevalent species were Escherichia coli (48.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (23.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%). Molecular analysis underlined the polyclonal spread of CTX-M-expressing E. coli, primarily isolates of the CTX-M-1 subgroup.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of guanylsulfonamides.
AB  - A series of guanylsulfonamides, 2-amino-9-[2-substituted-4-(4-substituted piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenyl]-1,9-dihydropurin-6-ones, was synthesized by adopting reductive aminoformylation of 2-amino-5-nitro-6-[4-(piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenylamino]-3H-pyrimidin- 4-one and subsequent intramolecular ring condensation as key steps. All the guanylsulfonamides were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis, and their antifungal activities against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans. Of the guanylsulfonamides, 13e and 13f displayed better antibacterial activities than that of Norfloxacin against the bacterial strains S. aureus and S. faecalis except 13f against S. faecalis, which exhibited the activity similar to that of Norfloxacin. Against the fungal strains A. flavus and A. niger, 13g and 13h showed similar activities to that of Griseoflavin-16 except 13h against A. niger, which displayed a profound drop in the activity compared to that of Griseoflavin-16. The remarkable inhibition of the growth of the bacterial and fungal strains makes these substances promising microbial agents.
TI  - Sperm motility changes after coincubation with various uropathogenic microorganisms: an in vitro experimental study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between semen motility and various uropathogenic microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semen specimens from healthy donors were divided into portions and incubated with uropathogenic microorganisms in concentrations varying from 2 x 10 to 2 x 10(7) microorganisms/ml(-1). Uninfected suspensions of spermatozoa served as controls. In all samples, sperm motility was examined at the second, fourth, and sixth hours after incubation in order to assess motility as a function of time. Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli were used as bacterial agents. Besides these bacterial strains, Candida albicans was also used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Observed negative impact on sperm motility was not correlated with microorganism concentration. However, until a certain concentration threshold, this impact was prominent. Regardless of the microorganism, this deleterious effect could not be confirmed in specimens coincubated with lower microorganism concentration. No or poor correlation was found between motility and bacteria concentration except with E. aerogenes at the second hour. The data indicates that sperm function impairment is not related to direct sperm and bacteria interaction. Instead, bacterial concentration enough to change the environment or to consume high energy might result in motility loss.
TI  - Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel lipoamino acid-based glycolipids for oral drug delivery.
AB  - A series of lipoamino acid-based glycolipids were synthesised. Suitably derivatised lipoamino acid derivatives were prepared and conjugated to monosaccharides (including glycosyl azides, isothiocyanates, thiols and sulphones) to yield novel O-, N-, S- and C-linked glycolipids in good yields. Their potential to improve the oral absorption of piperacillin is reported.
TI  - Incidence of class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Champagne-Ardenne (France): a 1 year prospective study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency and diversity of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in the Champagne-Ardenne region France, and to identify genetic elements associated with the bla(CTX-M) genes. METHODS: During 2004, all the non-duplicate isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to ceftazidime and of Enterobacteriaceae intermediate or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime, screening samples excluded, were collected in 10 public hospitals and 3 private clinics. bla genes were sequenced and bla(CTX-M) environment characterized by PCR mapping. RESULTS: In Enterobacteriaceae (138/21 861; 0.6%), ESBLs were predominantly TEM-24 (n = 52; 37.7%) and CTX-M-15 (n = 37; 26.8%). Three new enzymes were identified, CTX-M-61 (CTX-M-1 group), TEM- and SHV-type. A. baumannii (n = 5) produced VEB-1 and P. aeruginosa (n = 2) SHV-2a. ISEcp1 was detected in 22/27 strains, disrupted in 7 of them. The IS903-like element was downstream of bla(CTX-M-14) and bla(CTX-M-16). ISCR1 was found upstream of bla(CTX-M-2) and bla(CTX-M-9), and ISCR1 and bla(CTX-M-2) were located on a sul1-type class 1 integron. In comparison with 2001-02, ESBL distribution among Enterobacteriaceae showed an increase in CTX-M-type (44.9% vs 3.7% P < 10(-7)) due to Escherichia coli CTX-M-15 and to the almost total disappearance of TEM-3 (0.9% vs 51.2%). E. coli was the most frequent species (50.0% vs 5.1% in 1998) despite a similar prevalence to that in 1998 (0.5% vs 0.2%). CONCLUSIONS: A careful detection of bla(CTX-M)-type spread to other species would help to anticipate clonal endemics such as those observed in Enterobacter aerogenes TEM-24.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the United States between 1993 and 2004.
AB  - During the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in United States hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. MICs for 12 different agents were determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. The 11 organisms most frequently isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), Escherichia coli (18.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), Acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), Serratia marcescens (5.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), Proteus mirabilis (4.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and Citrobacter freundii (2.0%). Specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). Rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. Carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. E. coli and P. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. Mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with Acinetobacter spp. Rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study period for most species. Ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (Acinetobacter spp., C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens) became more susceptible. The prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among ICU isolates of Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae.
TI  - Synthesis, partition coefficients and antibacterial activity of 3'-phenyl (substituted)-6'-aryl-2' (1H)-cis-3',3'a-dihydrospiro [3-H-indole-3,5'-pyrazolo (3',4'-d)-thiazolo-2-(1H)-ones].
AB  - Condensation of isatin with primary aryl amines gave a series of Schiff bases (1) which on reaction with thioglycolic acid in 1,4-dioxane afforded the formation of the corresponding 4- thiazolidinones (2). Compound 2 on condensation with substituted benzaldehydes in anhydrous sodium acetate furnished 3-aryl -5'-phenyl (substituted) spiro [3H-indole-3,2'-thiazolidines]-2-(1H), 4'(5'H)-diones (3). The latter (3) on reaction with hydrazine hydrochloride in anhydrous sodium acetate gave 3'-phenyl (substituted) -6'-aryl-2'(1H)-cis-3',3'a-dihydrospiro [3H-indole-3,5'-pyrazolo (3',4'-d)-thiazolo-2-(1H)-ones] (4). The structure has been established on the basis of spectral data. The partition coefficient for n-octanol/water solvent system and in vitro antibacterial activity of the 2'(1H)-cis-3',3'a-dihydrospiro [3H-indole-3,5'-pyrazolo (3',4'-d)-thiazolo-2-(1H)-one] derivatives have been evaluated.
TI  - Characterization of a phosphodiesterase capable of hydrolyzing EA 2192, the most  toxic degradation product of the nerve agent VX.
AB  - Glycerophosphodiesterase (GpdQ) from Enterobacter aerogenes is a nonspecific diesterase that enables Escherichia coli to utilize alkyl phosphodiesters, such as diethyl phosphate, as the sole phosphorus source. The catalytic properties of GpdQ were determined, and the best substrate found was bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate with a kcat/Km value of 6.7 x 10(3) M-1 s-1. In addition, the E. aerogenes diesterase was tested as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of a series of phosphonate monoesters which are the hydrolysis products of the highly toxic organophosphonate nerve agents sarin, soman, GF, VX, and rVX. Among the phosphonate monoesters tested, the hydrolysis product of rVX, isobutyl methyl phosphonate, was the best substrate with a kcat/Km value of 33 M-1 s-1. The ability of GpdQ to hydrolyze the phosphonate monoesters provides an alternative selection strategy in the search of enhanced variants of the bacterial phosphotriesterase (PTE) for the hydrolysis of organophosphonate nerve agents. This investigation demonstrated that the previously reported activity of GpdQ toward the hydrolysis of methyl demeton-S is due to the presence of a diester contaminant in the commercial material. Furthermore, it was shown that GpdQ is capable of hydrolyzing a close analogue of EA 2192, the most toxic and persistent degradation product of the nerve agent VX.
TI  - The distribution of acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil bacteria.
AB  - Most bacteria possess the enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase, which is used to produce branched-chain amino acids. Enteric bacteria contain several isozymes suited to different conditions, but the distribution of acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil bacteria is largely unknown. Growth experiments confirmed that Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, and Enterobacter aerogenes contain isozymes of acetohydroxyacid synthase, allowing the bacteria to grow in the presence of valine (which causes feedback inhibition of AHAS I) or the sulfonylurea herbicide triasulfuron (which inhibits AHAS II) although a slight lag phase was observed in growth in the latter case. Several common soil isolates were inhibited by triasulfuron, but Pseudomonas fluorescens and Rhodococcus erythropolis were not inhibited by any combination of triasulfuron and valine. The extent of sulfonylurea-sensitive acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil was revealed when 21 out of 27 isolated bacteria in pure culture were inhibited by triasulfuron, the addition of isoleucine and/or valine reversing the effect in 19 cases. Primers were designed to target the genes encoding the large subunits (ilvB, ilvG and ilvI) of acetohydroxyacid synthase from available sequence data and a approximately 355 bp fragment in Bacillus subtilis, Arthrobacter globiformis, E. coli and S. enterica was subsequently amplified. The primers were used to create a small clone library of sequences from an agricultural soil. Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant sequence variation, but all 19 amino acid sequences were most closely related to published large subunit acetohydroxyacid synthase amino acid sequences within several phyla including the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The results suggested the majority of soil microorganisms contain only one functional acetohydroxyacid synthase enzyme sensitive to sulfonylurea herbicides.
TI  - Substrate specificity of the OqxAB multidrug resistance pump in Escherichia coli  and selected enteric bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A plasmid-encoded multidrug efflux pump, OqxAB, identified in Escherichia coli of porcine origin, was tested for substrate specificity against selected antibiotics, detergents and disinfectants. The ability of horizontal transfer to food-borne pathogens of the Enterobacteriaceae family was also investigated. METHODS: The MICs of selected substrates were determined with a broth dilution assay using two isogenic E. coli strains, except for the presence of the oqxAB operon. A derivative of the plasmid encoding OqxAB (pOLA52) was constructed and horizontal transfer to Salmonella Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Kluyvera sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes was investigated. The effect of the presence of the OqxAB pump on susceptibility for selected compounds was investigated using broth dilution assays. RESULTS: The OqxAB pump conferred antimicrobial resistance or reduced susceptibility towards a variety of substrates in E. coli. These included animal growth promoters, antimicrobials, disinfectants and detergents. pOLA52 could readily be transferred to enterobacterial pathogens. Transconjugants showed reduced susceptibility towards chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and olaquindox. CONCLUSIONS: The plasmid-encoded OqxAB pump has a wide substrate specificity and can be transferred between Enterobacteriaceae conferring reduced susceptibility to a multitude of substrates. These results could indicate some dependence on the outer membrane proteins present in the different species.
TI  - Inhibition of hydrogen uptake in Escherichia coli by expressing the hydrogenase from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular hydrogen is an environmentally-clean fuel and the reversible (bi-directional) hydrogenase of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as well as the native Escherichia coli hydrogenase 3 hold great promise for hydrogen generation. These enzymes perform the simple reaction 2H+ + 2e- <--> H2 (g). RESULTS: Hydrogen yields were enhanced up to 41-fold by cloning the bidirectional hydrogenase (encoded by hoxEFUYH) from the cyanobacterium into E. coli. Using an optimized medium, E. coli cells expressing hoxEFUYH also produced twice as much hydrogen as the well-studied Enterobacter aerogenes HU-101, and hydrogen gas bubbles are clearly visible from the cultures. Overexpression of HoxU alone (small diaphorase subunit) accounts for 43% of the additional hydrogen produced by HoxEFUYH. In addition, hydrogen production in E. coli mutants with defects in the native formate hydrogenlyase system show that the cyanobacterial hydrogenase depends on both the native E. coli hydrogenase 3 as well as on its maturation proteins. Hydrogen absorption by cells expressing hoxEFUYH was up to 10 times lower than cells which lack the cloned cyanobacterial hydrogenase; hence, the enhanced hydrogen production in the presence of hoxEFUYH is due to inhibition of hydrogen uptake activity in E. coli. Hydrogen uptake by cells expressing hoxEFUYH was suppressed in three wild-type strains and in two hycE mutants but not in a double mutant defective in hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2; hence, the active cyanobacterial locus suppresses hydrogen uptake by hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2 but not by hydrogenase 3. Differential gene expression indicated that overexpression of HoxEFUYH does not alter expression of the native E. coli hydrogenase system; instead, biofilm-related genes are differentially regulated by expression of the cyanobacterial enzymes which resulted in 2-fold elevated biofilm formation. This appears to be the first enhanced hydrogen production by cloning a cyanobacterial enzyme into a heterologous host. CONCLUSION: Enhanced hydrogen production in E. coli cells expressing the cyanobacterial HoxEFUYH is by inhibiting hydrogen uptake of both hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2.
TI  - Frequency of urinary tract infection in pediatric liver transplantation candidates.
AB  - An increased frequency of infections has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease. The tendency of patients in this population to acquire UTI is not completely understood. We aimed at investigating the incidence of UTI in children with cirrhosis, before liver transplantation. Twenty-six children (9 girls, 17 boys; mean age, 7.66 +/- 5.73 yr) with chronic liver disease who had undergone liver transplantation between 2002 and 2004 were included. On admission for liver transplantation, patients were examined for presence of UTI. Serum biochemistry, complete blood cell count, urinalysis and culture, glomerular filtration rate, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed prior to liver transplantation. Ten of 26 patients (38.5%) were found to have symptomatic UTI. Urine cultures revealed E. coli in five (50%), Klebsiella pneumoniae in three (30%), Enterococcus faecalis in one (10%), and Enterobacter aeruginosa in one (10%) patient(s), respectively, as etiologic factors. The etiologies of chronic liver disease in our patients with UTI were BA in five, PFIC in three, Wilson's disease in one, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in one patient. We found a significantly greater number of UTIs in patients with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia (p < 0.05). The mean age of the patients with UTI was 2.75 +/- 3.49 yr, which was significantly lower than in those without UTI (9.75 +/- 4.86 yr, p < 0.05). Levels for white blood cells, thrombocytes, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in patients with UTI than in those without UTI. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to serum albumin, bilirubin, AST, GGT, BUN, or creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate, duration of disease, and PELD scores. In patients with bacteriuria, renal USG revealed normal findings in all, but except one patient who had pelvicalyceal dilatation. Scintigraphic findings demonstrated acute pyelonephritis in six (60%) patients with UTI. VCUG demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in two patients. In conclusion, symptomatic UTI is common in children with cirrhosis. It occurs more frequently in patients with biliary atresia than it does in patients with other types of chronic liver disease. In febrile children with chronic liver disease, UTI should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
TI  - Regional variations in multidrug resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in the USA and comparative activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - We report here on the activity of tigecycline and comparators against multidrug-resistant (resistant to >or=3 antimicrobial classes; MDR) Enterobacteriaceae from the USA collected between January 2004 and January 2006 as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST). Nationally, 131 (5.9%) Escherichia coli, 174 (10.1%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 (1.2%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 24 (4.9%) Enterobacter aerogenes, 126 (9.5%) Enterobacter cloacae and 20 (2.6%) Serratia marcescens isolates were MDR. Four isolates (two K. pneumoniae and two E. cloacae) were resistant to nine antimicrobials. Tigecycline performed well against MDR E. coli (MIC(90) 0.5 microg/mL, 0% resistant) and K. pneumoniae (MIC(90) 4 microg/mL, 9.2% resistant). A MIC(90) of 8 microg/mL was reported for tigecycline against the other MDR organisms studied here, notably lower than those of most comparators.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of snake, scorpion and bee venoms: a comparison with purified venom phospholipase A2 enzymes.
AB  - AIMS: Venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified PLA(2)s and two L-amino acid oxidases (LAAO) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). Several snake venoms (Daboia russelli russelli, Crotalus adamanteus, Naja sumatrana, Pseudechis guttata, Agkistrodon halys, Acanthophis praelongus and Daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. Daboia russelli russelli and Pseudechis australis venoms exhibited the most potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. The order of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -S. aureus > Proteus mirabilis > Proteus vulgaris > Enterobacter aerogenes > Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against S. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). A stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). The MIC were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that viperidae (D. russelli russelli) and elapidae (P. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the PLA(2) enzymes. The results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The activity of LAAO and PLA(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.
TI  - Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  - Three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), the VITEK 2 System (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and the MicroScan WalkAway-96 System (Dade Behring, Inc., West Sacramento, CA), using routine testing panels. One hundred fifty putative ESBL producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. Conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the CLSI double-disk synergy test, and the Etest ESBL were also evaluated. Biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. One hundred forty-seven isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii were investigated. Of these isolates, 85 were identified as ESBL producers by the reference method. The remaining isolates were identified as non-ESBL producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal AmpC, Koxy, or SHV enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. The system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of ESBLs was the Phoenix (99%), followed by the VITEK 2 (86%) and the MicroScan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (Phoenix) to 78% (VITEK 2). The performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. The sensitivities of the conventional test methods ranged from 93 to 94%. The double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.
TI  - Management of risk of microbial cross-contamination from uncooked frozen hamburgers by alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
AB  - This research was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer on hands contaminated with a nonpathogen surrogate for Escherichia coli O157:H7, where the source of the contamination was frozen hamburger patties. A nonpathogenic nalidixic acid-resistant food-grade strain of Enterobacter aerogenes was used to inoculate frozen hamburger patties composed of 76% lean beef and 24% fat. Thirty-two individuals participated to produce the data used in this study. Each participant handled nine patties at least three times, a sample for microbiological analysis was collected from the surface of one hand, the participant sanitized both hands, and a sample was collected from the other hand. Burger handling created perceptible and visible food debris on the hands of most participants. Computer simulations also were used to perform a variety of risk calculations. The average reduction in bacteria from the use of sanitizer on hands contaminated by frozen burgers containing E. aerogenes was 2.6 +/- 0.7 log CFU per hand. An experiment designed to simultaneously test the effect of sanitizer on E. aerogenes and E. coli O157:H7 also revealed no significant difference in sanitizer effectiveness against the two organisms. The results of the real-world risk estimation calculations (using the actual prevalence and concentration of E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef) predict that once in 1 million trials, a single pathogen cell will be transferred to a single lettuce piece. The effectiveness of this sanitizer intervention was similar to that for hand washing and glove use previously reported. The person-to-person microbial reduction variability from sanitizer use is similar to published data for glove use and was less variable than published data on hand washing effectiveness.
TI  - Synthesis of pseudopeptides based L-tryptophan as a potential antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Four compounds named L-BTrpPA, L-Trp-o-PA, L-Trp-m-PA and L-Trp-p-PA, pseudopeptides constructed from pyridine and tryptophan units, were synthesized and tested against the Gram-positive, Gram-negative strains of bacteria and human pathogenic fungi. L-Trp-o-PA proved to be a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, showing a significant inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus), and pathogenic fungi (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodotorula glutinis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus spp., Rhizopus nigricans) tested and activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) tested. The in vitro cell cytotoxicity of L-Trp-o-PA was evaluated using haemolytic assay, in which the compound was found to have low lytic property, even up to the concentration of 4000 microg/mL, it only lysed 6-7% of erythrocytes, which was 100-fold greater than the MICs (minimum inhibitory concentration).
TI  - Emerging bacterial pathogens: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis clinical isolates harbouring the same transferable plasmid coding for metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-1 in Greece.
TI  - Effect of a chronic nail-biting habit on the oral carriage of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Nail biting is a common oral habit in children and young adults. However, its effect on the oral carriage of Enterobacteriaceae is unclear. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the differences in prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae in saliva samples from subjects with and without a nail-biting habit. METHODS: Saliva samples were taken from 25 subjects who were nail-biters and 34 subjects with no oral habit. The mean chronological age for all subjects was 13.5 +/- 1.9 years. The saliva samples were studied microbiologically. A Pearson chi-squared test was performed to compare the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae in the saliva samples of the subjects with and without nail-biting habits. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found in the prevalence of Escherichia coli and total Enterobacteriaceae between both groups (P < 0.001). E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter gergoviae were found in the saliva samples of 19 of the 25 nail-biting subjects (76%), whereas E. coli, E. aerogenes and E. cloacae were detected in the saliva samples of only nine of the 34 subjects who were not nail-biters (26.5%). CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, the Enterobacteriaceae were more prevalent in the oral cavities of children with nail-biting habits than in children with no oral habit.
TI  - Emergence of ArmA and RmtB aminoglycoside resistance 16S rRNA methylases in Belgium.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: 16S rRNA methylase-mediated high-level resistance to aminoglycosides  has been reported recently in clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli only from a limited number of countries. This study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of this type of resistance in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from two Belgian hospitals and the characteristics of the strains. METHODS: We screened for high-level gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin resistance in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae consecutively collected between 2000 and 2005 at two laboratories by PCR for the armA, rmtA and rmtB 16S rRNA methylase genes. The beta-lactamase presence in the strains was also determined by phenotypic and genotypic methods. RESULTS: Overall armA genes were detected in 18 Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter amalonaticus whereas rmtB was detected in a single E. coli isolate. The rmtA gene was not found. All 16S rRNA methylase-bearing strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), predominantly type CTX-M-3, as well as various types of beta-lactamases. In the majority of the strains, the armA gene was carried by conjugative plasmids of the IncL/M incompatibility group whereas rmtB was borne by an IncFI plasmid. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the emergence of 16S rRNA methylases in Enterobacteriaceae in Belgium. The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant isolates producing both ESBLs and 16S rRNA methylases raises clinical concern and may become a major therapeutic threat in the future.
TI  - Evaluation of a new selective chromogenic agar medium for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A novel chromogenic agar medium (ESBL-Bx; bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was compared to MacConkey agar supplemented with 2 mg ceftazidime/liter (MCKC) for the selective isolation and presumptive identification of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae directly from clinical samples. Of a total of 644 clinical specimens (including 551 fecal samples), 496 yielded no growth and 148 yielded growth on one or both media. Overall, 44 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains (Escherichia coli [n=17], Enterobacter aerogenes [n=17], Klebsiella spp. [n=5], and Citrobacter freundii [n=5]) were isolated from 37 specimens by a combination of both methods after 18 to 24 h of incubation. The sensitivities were 97.7 and 84.1% for ESBL-Bx and MCKC, respectively, with 43 ESBL-positive strains isolated as colored colonies from 36 specimens on ESBL-Bx versus 37 ESBL-positive organisms isolated from 32 specimens on MCKC. The specificities by specimens were 89 and 91% for ESBL-Bx and MCKC, respectively. On either one of the two media, natural AmpC-hyperproducing Enterobacter spp. (n=25) and Citrobacter spp. (n=14) were the most common false positives as well as non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca (n=18) on ESBL-Bx and Morganella morganii (n=10) on MCKC. We conclude that ESBL-Bx is a sensitive and specific medium for the isolation of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae from clinical samples. The main advantages of ESBL-Bx over MCKC reside in its chromogenic character and its sensitivity and selectivity, which enabled the recovery and presumptive identification of most ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae within 24 h and reduced by 27% the need for unnecessary identification and confirmation of ESBL testing when disregarding all colorless colonies growing on this medium.
TI  - The UreEF fusion protein provides a soluble and functional form of the UreF urease accessory protein.
AB  - Four accessory proteins (UreD, UreE, UreF, and UreG) are typically required to form the nickel-containing active site in the urease apoprotein (UreABC). Among the accessory proteins, UreD and UreF have been elusive targets for biochemical and structural characterization because they are not overproduced as soluble proteins. Using the best-studied urease system, in which the Klebsiella aerogenes genes are expressed in Escherichia coli, a translational fusion of ureE and ureF was generated. The UreEF fusion protein was overproduced as a soluble protein with a convenient tag involving the His-rich region of UreE. The fusion protein was able to form a UreD(EF)G-UreABC complex and to activate urease in vivo, and it interacted with UreD-UreABC in vitro to form a UreD(EF)-UreABC complex. While the UreF portion of UreEF is fully functional, the fusion significantly affected the role of the UreE portion by interrupting its dimerization and altering its metal binding properties compared to those of the wild-type UreE. Analysis of a series of UreEF deletion mutants revealed that the C terminus of UreF is required to form the UreD(EF)G-UreABC complex, while the N terminus of UreF is essential for activation of urease.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli in the fecal microflora of children.
AB  - The extent to which antibiotic-resistant bacteria are excreted by humans who have not been exposed to antibiotics is not known. Children, who rarely receive fluoroquinolones, provide opportunities to assess the frequency of fecal excretion by fluoroquinolone-naive hosts of fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacilli. Fresh nondiarrheal stools from children were processed by screening them on agar containing ciprofloxacin to recover ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli. Resistant isolates were identified, and ciprofloxacin MICs were determined. Resistant Escherichia coli isolates were also analyzed for urovirulence-associated loci. Thirteen (2.9%) of 455 stools yielded ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli (seven children), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (four children), and Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Enterobacter aerogenes (one child each). Neither the subjects themselves nor members of their households used fluoroquinolones in the 4 weeks preceding collection. Six of the seven resistant E. coli isolates belonged to phylogenetic groups B2 and D, in which extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli bacteria are frequently found. All resistant E. coli isolates contained at least three putative E. coli virulence loci. Most ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria were resistant to additional antibiotics. Potentially pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to therapeutically important antimicrobial agents are excreted by some humans, despite these persons' lack of exposure to the particular drugs. The sources of these resistant organisms are unknown. This underrecognized reservoir of drug-resistant potential pathogens poses public health challenges.
TI  - Evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (MSPs) in Dar es Salaam region. Total bacterial count (TBC) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the California mastitis test (CMT) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. Moreover, a water sample at each MSP was taken for bacteriological culturing. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the MSPs to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. A total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in Dar es Salaam region. The mean TBC was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were Escherichia coli (6.3%), Bacillus cereus (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), Enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). In most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. Of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the CMT and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. TBC was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of TBC were identified by fitting two linear regression models. In a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log TBC. In a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log TBC. It was concluded that the milk sold in Dar es Salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
TI  - Intracellular accumulation of linezolid in Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes: role of enhanced efflux pump activity and inactivation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The oxazolidinone class of antibiotics such as linezolid have a narrow spectrum of activity that targets Gram-positive bacteria. We hypothesized that the poor activity of linezolid in Gram-negative bacteria is in part caused by relatively low intracellular concentration due to efflux. METHODS: Using whole cell accumulation assays we estimated the intracellular concentration of linezolid in Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae. We included test strains with enhanced RND-type multidrug efflux pump activity and with genetic inactivation of the pump or functional inhibition by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone as inhibitor of the proton motive force or 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (NMP), an efflux pump inhibitor. RESULTS: Consistent with susceptibility studies, enhanced pump activity caused decreased accumulation, and pump inactivation and inhibition caused increased accumulation, of linezolid. The accumulation levels in test strains of E. coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes with functional pumps were lower than in control strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium, but were higher after pump inactivation and correlated with ethidium bromide and pyronin Y accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: The intracellular concentration of linezolid is comparatively low owing to efficient efflux of the drug and could be increased substantially by inhibition of RND-type efflux pumps.
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and biological activity of cobalt(II) and copper(II) complexes of valine-derived schiff bases.
AB  - We have synthesized two cobalt(II) 2 and copper(II) 3 complexes of valine-derived Schiff bases. The obtained complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR and X-ray diffraction. Biological studies of complexes 2 and 3 had been carried out in vitro for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and human pathogenic fungi. Compound 3 was proven to be a broad spectrum agent, showed a significant inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus), and pathogenic fungi (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodothece glutinis, Saccharomyces cerevisia, Aspergillus spp., Rhizopus nigricans) tested and a moderate activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes) tested. The in vitro cytotoxicity of compound 3 was evaluated using hemolytic assay, in which the compound 3 was found to be non-toxic to human erythrocytes even at a concentration of 500mug/mL.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of bioconverted eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) against foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of bioconversion extracts of EPA and DHA against a range of foodborne pathogenic bacteria was investigated. The bioconverted EPA and DHA exhibited antibacterial activities against four gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) and S. aureus (KCTC 1916) and seven gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, E. coli O157:H7 (human), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium. The growth inhibition by both bioconverted EPA and DHA was similar against gram-positive bacteria, while the bioconverted extract of DHA was more effective than EPA against gram-negative bacteria as determined by minimum inhibitory concentration.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of 6-methylidene penems bearing 6,5 bicyclic heterocycles as broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitors: evidence for 1,4-thiazepine intermediates with C7 R stereochemistry by computational methods.
AB  - The design and synthesis of a series of 6-methylidene penems containing [6,5]-fused bicycles (thiophene, imidazole, or pyrazle-fused system) as novel class A, B, and C beta-lactamase inhibitors is described. These penems proved to be potent inhibitors of the TEM-1 (class A) and AmpC (class C) beta-lactamases and less so against the class B metallo-beta-lactamase CcrA. Their in vitro and in vivo activities in combination with piperacillin are discussed. On the basis of the crystallographic structures of a serine-bound reaction intermediate of 2 with SHV-1 (class A) and GC1 (class C) enzymes, compounds 14a-l were designed and synthesized. Penems are proposed to form a seven-membered 1,4 thiazepine ring in both class A and C beta-lactamases. The interaction energy calculation for the enzyme-bound intermediates favor the formation of the C7 R enantiomer over the S enantiomer of the 1,4-thiazepine in both beta-lactamases, which is consistent with those obtained from the crystal structure of 2 with SHV-1 and GC1.
TI  - The purification, crystallization and preliminary diffraction of a glycerophosphodiesterase from Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - The metallo-glycerophosphodiesterase from Enterobacter aerogenes (GpdQ) has been  cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Initial screening of crystallization conditions for this enzyme resulted in the identification of needles from one condition in a sodium malonate grid screen. Removal of the metals from the enzyme and subsequent optimization of these conditions led to crystals that diffracted to 2.9 angstroms and belonged to space group P2(1)3, with unit-cell parameter a = 164.1 angstroms. Self-rotation function analysis and V(M) calculations indicated that the asymmetric unit contains two copies of the monomeric enzyme, corresponding to a solvent content of 79%. It is intended to determine the structure of this protein utilizing SAD phasing from transition metals or molecular replacement.
TI  - [Photometric method for differentiation of bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae at the level of strain affiliation].
TI  - Gram-negative meningitis and infections in individuals treated with intrathecal baclofen for spasticity: a retrospective study.
AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to describe signs, symptoms, and clinical outcomes of individuals undergoing intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy who experienced pump-related Gram-negative infections including meningitis. Participants included 12 individuals (nine males, three females) aged 10 to 32 years (mean 17y 9mo), nine of whom had quadriplegic CP. A total of 571 baclofen pump surgeries were performed with 45 total infections. Of the 45 infections, 12 were by Gram-negative organisms, two resulting in meningitis. Ten of 12 Gram-negative infections (21 site encounters) occurred within 60 days of surgery. Eleven of 12 pumps were explanted. By site encounters, Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for eight Gram-negative infections, Escherichia coli for five, Proteus for three, Enterobacter cloacae for two, and Klebsiella, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter vulnaris for one each. Two individuals with Gram-negative meningitis were admitted 72 to 96 hours after hospital discharge following pump replacement. Both patients had rapid deterioration requiring transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit, and developed coagulopathy and decrease in responsiveness. Both have improved and have elected not to replace the ITB pump. In Gram-negative infections in ITB therapy, the progression of signs and symptoms can be swift and devastating. Identification of the infectious agent in such cases is imperative; these infections can quickly become life threatening.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Surrogates for validation of electron beam irradiation of foods.
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify a potential surrogate to describe the radiation sensitivity of the most common pathogens encountered in fruits. Three pathogens: Escherichia coli O157:H7 933, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 51414, and Salmonella Poona, and five non-pathogens: E. coli K-12 MG1655, Listeria innocua Seeliger 1983 (NRRL B-33003 and NRRl B-33014), Enterobacter aerogenes, and Salmonella LT2 were inoculated (populations of 10(7)-10(9) CFU/ml) into model food systems (10% w/w gelatin) and exposed to doses up to 1.0 kGy using a 2 MeV Van der Graaf linear accelerator. The non-pathogen E. coli K-12 MG1655 was highly resistant to radiation (D(10)=0.88 kGy) in comparison to the other strains while L. monocytogenes was the more radiation-resistant pathogen (D(10)=1.09 kGy). Thus, E. coli K-12 MG1655 could be a suitable surrogate for e-beam studies with L. monocytogenes as the indicator pathogen. L. innocua strains were more radiation-sensitive (D(10)=0.66, 0.72 kGy) than their pathogenic counterpart. S. Poona and E. coli O157:H7 were even more radiation-sensitive (D(10)=0.38, 0.36 kGy, respectively). S. LT2 was the least radiation-resistant pathogen with D(10)=0.12 kGy. In a later study, the radiation resistance of the pathogens and the surrogate was evaluated when inoculated in a real food (i.e., fresh cantaloupe). The D(10) values obtained in this experiment were higher than those obtained with the model foods. However, the surrogate was still more radiation-resistant and could therefore be used to indicate decontamination of the target pathogens under electron beam irradiation.
TI  - [Microbial description of bacteriuria in long-term care facilities: a prospective study in the French Teaching Hospital of Strasbourg].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors had for aim to assess, the incidence of symptomatic bacteriuria and the level of antibiotic resistance in bacteria identified in long-term care facilities (LTC). DESIGN: Symptomatic bacteriuria cases were prospectively collected, during 9 months in the two LTC of the Strasbourg French Teaching Hospital (196 beds). RESULTS: One hundred and eleven bacteriuria cases were included. They concerned 67 of the 274 residents (cumulative incidence: 2.07/1,000 patients-day). A gram-negative bacillus was identified in 85% of the symptomatic bacteriuria cases, and Escherichia coli in 40%. Sixty percent of the identified bacterial strain was resistant to amoxicillin (Amx-R) and 42% to the clavulanic acid combination (AmC-R). Third generation cephalosporins (3GC) were effective in 90% of Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and fluoroquinolones in 65% (Fq). Four bacterias with broad beta-lactamase spectrum were identified (0.04%) including 3 Enterobacter aerogenes. No yeast infection was diagnosed. E. coli strains were 65% Amx-R and 50% AmC-R. Concerning the Fq-R strains (15%), 50% were cotrimoxazole resistant (Stx-R) and 70% Amx-R; 3GC remained effective (82%). CONCLUSION: In LTC, multi-drug resistance bacteria are rare and 3GCs seem to be the best first line treatment. Nevertheless, Fq-R is increasing (15 vs 8%), and attention must be paid to the antibiotic therapy used.
TI  - Late infection of an endovascular stent graft with septic embolization, colonic perforation, and aortoduodenal fistula.
AB  - We report on a 52-year-old male who developed late stent graft infection resulting in infective aneurysm formation with systemic septic embolization and aortoduodenal fistulation 9 months following endoluminal repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Although endoluminal stent graft infection and erosion into surrounding viscera is rare, we highlight the need for awareness of this potentially catastrophic complication.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - Evaluation of the methods for enumerating coliform bacteria from water samples using precise reference standards.
AB  - AIMS: To use BioBall cultures as a precise reference standard to evaluate methods for enumeration of Escherichia coli and other coliform bacteria in water samples. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight methods were evaluated including membrane filtration, standard plate count (pour and spread plate methods), defined substrate technology methods (Colilert and Colisure), the most probable number method and the Petrifilm disposable plate method. Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes BioBall cultures containing 30 organisms each were used. All tests were performed using 10 replicates. The mean recovery of both bacteria varied with the different methods employed. CONCLUSIONS: The best and most consistent results were obtained with Petrifilm and the pour plate method. Other methods either yielded a low recovery or showed significantly high variability between replicates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The BioBall is a very suitable quality control tool for evaluating the efficiency of methods for bacterial enumeration in water samples.
TI  - Urinary tract infection and hyperbilirubinemia.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in newborns with asymptomatic, unexplained indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the first two weeks of life. Jaundiced infants, otherwise clinically well, less than two weeks of ages, with a total bilirubin level above 15 mg/dl were eligible for the study. A bilirubin work-up including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6 PD) level, as well as urinalysis and a urine culture were performed in all patients. Patients with UTI, defined as more than 10,000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen obtained by bladder catheterization, were evaluated for sepsis. Renal function tests and renal ultrasound were performed in cases with UTI. During follow-up, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) were performed as well. A total of 102 patients were enrolled. The bilirubin work-up of patients did not demonstrate any significant underlying disorder. None of the infants had a high direct bilirubin level. UTI was diagnosed in eight (8%) cases [Enterobacter aerogenes (3/8:38%), Enterococcus faecalis (2/8:25%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/8:25%) and Escherichia coli (1/8:12%)]. Of those eight patients, only four (50%) had pyuria. Bacteriuria was present in seven (88%) patients. The sepsis screen was negative in all but one case with a high C-reactive protein (CRP) level. None of the patients had a positive blood culture. Renal function tests were within normal levels in all patients. Renal ultrasound showed urinary tract abnormalities in three (38%) patients (hydronephrosis, n=1 and pelviectasis, n=2). VCUG was performed in all patients during the study period and one had unilateral grade 3-4 reflux, while only one patient had a diverticulum of the bladder. DMSA was performed in seven patients and none had renal scars. It is of importance that UTI can occur in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants even in the first week of life. Although it is well known that UTI is a common cause of prolonged jaundice, urine culture should be considered in the bilirubin work-up of infants older than three days of age with an unknown etiology.
TI  - Enterobacter gergoviae and the prevalence of efflux in parabens resistance.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In order to characterize the mechanism involved in parabens resistance, we studied 13 Enterobacter gergoviae collected from diverse cosmetic formulations containing parabens as preservatives and 10 isolates from clinical or industrial sources. METHODS: RAPD and ERIC-PCR were employed and compared for the epidemiological typing. To study antibiotic and paraben susceptibility, the standard disc diffusion method and the 2-fold dilution method in Luria-Bertani medium were used. Characterization of porins was performed using immunodetection with polyclonal antibodies. Resistance mechanisms against parabens membrane permeabilization were evaluated by measuring K(+) efflux using a specific electrode. mar regulon identification and comparison were carried out. RESULTS: Epidemiological typing confirmed that most of the cosmetic formulations were contaminated by unrelated strains. All of the E. gergoviae strains presented high methylparaben MICs, ranging from 1 to 3.8 g/L, values that were 2-5 times higher than for Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes, even in strains overexpressing MarA. These MICs decreased in the presence of phenylalanine arginine beta-naphthylamide, pinpointing efflux as a major mechanism of parabens resistance even in E. gergoviae clinical strains. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing the role of active efflux in the parabens resistance in E. gergoviae, a mechanism that may explain its frequent isolation in parabens-containing cosmetics compared with other enterobacterial species. Paraben efflux seems to be regulated by a mar-independent process in E. gergoviae.
TI  - Induction by Klebsiella aerogenes of a melanin-like pigment in Cryptococcus neoformans.
AB  - While studying the interaction of Cryptococcus neoformans with Dictyostelium discoideum, we noticed that yeast colonies in agar with a feeder lawn of Klebsiella aerogenes were brown. This finding was intriguing because C. neoformans colonies are not pigmented unless they are provided with precursors for melanization. Strains of all C. neoformans serotypes produced brown pigment in response to K. aerogenes at 22, 30, and 37 degrees C. Pigment production required fungal laccase and was suppressed by high concentrations of glucose. Treatment of brown cells with guanidinium isothiocyanate and hot concentrated HCl yielded particulate material that had the physical and chemical characteristics of melanins. No pigment formation was observed when C. neoformans was exposed to live Escherichia coli or heat-killed K. aerogenes. Analysis of K. aerogenes supernatants revealed the presence of dopamine, which can be a substrate for melanin synthesis by C. neoformans. Our findings illustrate a remarkable interaction between a pathogenic fungus and a gram-negative bacterium, in which the bacterium produces a substrate that promotes fungal melanization. This observation provides a precedent that could explain the source of a substrate for C. neoformans melanization in the environment.
TI  - Distribution of a transposon-like element carrying bla(CMY-2) among Salmonella and other Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The dissemination of cephamycin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and  its correlation with a transposon-like DNA element consisting of a specific tnpA-bla(CMY-2)-blc-sugE structure were investigated. METHODS: A total of 140 enterobacterial isolates belonging to 17 species (10 genera) of Enterobacteriaceae phenotypically characterized as putative AmpC-producers were evaluated. The isolates were examined by PCR analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization and nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: The bla(CMY-2)-carrying element was detected in 34 isolates from 10 species (9 genera), including all 14 Salmonella and 4 Shigella isolates as well as 7 of the 10 Escherichia coli isolates tested. The remaining 9 isolates were from 112 isolates of the other 14 species tested. The genetic structure of the bla(CMY-2)-carrying element was identical in 29 isolates, while in 3 E. coli and 2 Citrobacter isolates an additional insertion sequence IS1 was found inserted at various nucleotide positions close to the 3' end, either within or downstream, of tnpA. In 12 of the 14 representative isolates examined, the bla(CMY-2)-carrying element was found inserted in the finQ gene of various-sized plasmids with highly conserved 8 bp direct repeats flanking the junction regions. Among the other 106 non-CMY-2-producing isolates, plasmid-mediated ampC genes were found only in one isolate of Enterobacter aerogenes which carried a bla(DHA-1)-like gene. CONCLUSIONS: bla(CMY-2) is the most prevalent plasmid-mediated ampC gene among Enterobacteriaceae. All the bla(CMY-2) genes identified in the present study were associated with a specific transposon-like element that may be responsible for the spread of bla(CMY-2) among Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Determination of the antimicrobial properties of oligo-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde.
AB  - Oligo-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (OHNA) was synthesized by oxidative polycondensation using H2O2 (35%, aqueous solution), air O2 and NaOCl (34%, aqueous solution) by Kaya and Senol and the products were characterized by spectral techniques. Antimicrobial activities of the first and second fractions of OHNA were tested against Corynobacterium xerosis CCM 2824, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6897, Staphylococcus epidermidis NRRL B-4877, S. aureus ATCC 6538, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048, Salmonella thyphimurium CCM 5445, Pseudomonas aeroginosa ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli ATCC 11230, E. coli ATCC 23998, Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064, B. cereus ATCC 99, B. subtilis ATCC 6633, Yersinia spp., Neisseria canis, Rhodotorula rubra, Kluyveromyces fragilis NRRL 2415, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 9763, S. ovarum, Debaryomyces hensenii, Hansenula anamola, Candida albicans, C. utilis, Aspergillus niger, A. fumigates, A. versicolor, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, Penicillium granulatum, P. chrysogenum, and P. herque. OHNA demonstrated antimicrobial activity against various bacteria and yeast, but did not affect filamentous fungi.
TI  - Effect of 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine, a novel putative efflux pump inhibitor, on antimicrobial drug susceptibility in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae other than Escherichia coli.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: 1-(1-Naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (NMP) has been shown to reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) in Escherichia coli overexpressing RND type efflux pumps, but there is no data on its activity in Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibilities of laboratory strains and 167 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae to a variety of antimicrobial agents were determined in the absence and presence of NMP and, for comparison, of Phe-Arg-beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN), another putative efflux pump inhibitor (EPI). A 4-fold or greater reduction of the MIC after EPI addition was considered significant. RESULTS: NMP consistently reduced the MIC of linezolid in Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates. Significant effects of NMP addition in >50% of tested isolates were also seen for levofloxacin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol in E. aerogenes, and for levofloxacin and tetracycline in K. pneumoniae, whereas no or minor effects were observed in Serratia marcescens. MDR reversal by NMP was more likely in isolates with decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. In most fluoroquinolone-resistant strains the activity was sufficient to render isolates drug-susceptible at clinically achievable concentrations. The activity of PAbetaN was different from that of NMP, suggesting different modes of action of the two putative EPIs. CONCLUSION: NMP has moderate activity in reversing MDR in many but not all members of the Enterobacteriaceae family including clinical isolates. Its effects on resistance reversal depend on bacterial species and drug, and are different from those seen with PAbetaN.
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - [Profiles of the utilization of 20 amino acids as the only source of nitrogen and carbon in bacteria of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia].
AB  - The profiles of the utilization of 20 protein amino acids in 118 Klebsiella pneumoniae sub- sp. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. planticola, K. mobilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marscescens, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli strains isolated from clinical material were studied. The utilization of amino acids was determined on minimal saline agar containing amino acid as the only source of nitrogen and carbon; the results were evaluated after 72-hour incubation at 37 degrees C. 17 profiles of amino-acid utilization were thus determined, most of them genus-specific in enterobacteria: Klebsiella (profiles No. 1--6, 9, 10), Enterobacter (No. 11--13), Serratia (No. 14--16), Escherichia (No. 17). The full coincidence of amino-acid utilization profiles in bacteria of K. mobilis (No. 1, 6) and K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae with out of such profiles in bacteria of the genera Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia was established, which confirmed that K. mobilis (formerly Enterobacter aerogenes) belonged to the genus Klebsiella.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Acid phosphatase/phosphotransferases from enteric bacteria.
AB  - We have investigated the enzymatic phosphorylation of nucleosides and found that  Morganella morganii phoC acid phosphatase exhibits regioselective pyrophosphate (PP(i))-nucleoside phosphotransferase activity. In this study, we isolated genes encoding an acid phosphatase with regioselective phosphotransferase activity (AP/PTase) from Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia blattae and Klebsiella planticola, and compared the primary structures and enzymatic characteristics of these enzymes with those of AP/PTase (PhoC acid phosphatase) from M. morganii. The enzymes were highly homologous in primary structure with M. morganii AP/PTase, and are classified as class A1 acid phosphatases. The synthesis of inosine-5'-monophosphate (5'-IMP) by E. coli overproducing each acid phosphatase was investigated. The P. stuartii enzyme, which is most closely related to the M. morganii enzyme, exhibited high 5'-IMP productivity, similar to the M. morganii enzyme. The 5'-IMP productivities of the E. aerogenes, E. blattae and K. planticola enzymes were inferior to those of the former two enzymes. This result underlines the importance of lower K(m) values for efficient nucleotide production. As these enzymes exhibited a very high degree of homology at the amino acid sequence level, it is likely that local sequence differences in the binding pocket are responsible for the differences in the nucleoside-PP(i) phosphotransferase reaction.
TI  - Clinical and molecular analysis of extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase-producing enterobacteria in the community setting.
AB  - During a previous survey, five extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  enterobacteria (ESBLE) (two Enterobacter aerogenes isolates expressing TEM-24 b, two Escherichia coli isolates expressing TEM-21 or TEM-24 b, and one Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate expressing SHV-4/TEM-15) responsible for urinary tract infections (UTIs) were found among 1,584 strains collected from community patients. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the route of emergence of these typically nosocomial organisms in the community. Thus, the files of the five patients were analyzed over at least a decade, and potentially related ESBLE from hospitals or clinics were examined. Their enzymes were characterized at a molecular level, and the strains were typed by amplified-primed PCR, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, and restriction plasmid profile. All patients (C1 to C5) had risk factors for ESBLE acquisition, including past history of hospitalization (2.5 to 23 months before). Four (C1 and C3 to C5) had previously received antibiotics (concomitantly to 35 months earlier), two (C1 and C3) had indwelling urinary catheters and recurrent UTIs, and three (C2, C3, and C5) formerly experienced ESBLE-induced UTIs (2 to 11 months before). The same ESBLE and/or an identical or similar ESBL-encoding plasmid was identified in the hospital ward (C1 to C4) or in a clinic (C5) where the patients had previously resided. Patients C1 and C4, infected with different ESBLE carrying a closely related plasmid, were hospitalized in the same unit. Persistence of ESBLE over at least a 5-year period was demonstrated for patient C3. Thus, community-acquired UTIs in these patients likely resulted from nosocomially acquired ESBLE or an ESBL-encoding plasmid followed by a prolonged digestive carriage.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - Occurrence and regulation of the ferric citrate transport system in Escherichia coli B, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Photorhabdus luminescens.
AB  - In Escherichia coli K-12, transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes fecABCDE is initiated by binding of diferric dicitrate to the outer membrane protein FecA which elicits a signaling cascade from the cell surface to the cytoplasm. The FecI sigma factor is only active in the presence of FecR, which transfers the signal across the cytoplasmic membrane. In other bacteria, fecIRA homologues control iron transport gene transcription by siderophores other than citrate. However, in most cases, the FecI homologues are active in the absence of the FecR homologues, which might function as anti-sigma factors. Since not all E. coli strains contain a fec system, we determined the occurrence of fec genes in selected Enterobacteriaceae and the dependence of FecI activity on FecR. Incomplete FecIRA systems were chromosomally encoded in Enterobacter aerogenes strains and plasmid-encoded in K. pneumoniae. E. coli B, Photorhabdus luminescens and one of three Klebsiella pneumoniae strains had a functional FecIRA regulatory system as in E. coli K-12. The cytoplasmic N-terminal FecR fragments caused constitutive FecI activity in the absence of ferric citrate. The PCR-generated mutant FecI(D40G) was inactive and FecI(S15P) was partially active. FecR of E. coli K-12 activated FecI of all tested strains except FecI encoded on the virulence plasmid pLVPK of K. pneumoniae, which differed from E. coli K-12 FecI by having mutations in region 4, which is important for interaction with FecR. The C-terminally truncated FecR homologue of pLVPK was inactive. pLVPK-encoded FecA contains a 38-residue sequence in front of the signal sequence that did not prevent processing and proper integration of FecA into the outer membrane of E. coli and lacks the signaling sequence required for transcription initiation of the fec transport genes, making it induction-incompetent but transport-competent. The evidence indicates that fecIRABCDE genes are acquired by horizontal DNA transfer and can undergo debilitating mutations.
TI  - Bacterial species specificity in proU osmoinducibility and nptII and lacZ expression.
AB  - Reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. To more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. A comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptII promoter (P(nptII)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacZ promoter (P(lacZ)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than P(lacZ). For the species that expressed P(lacZ), however,P(lacZ) was expressed 3-fold more than P(nptII), on average. The Escherichia coli proU promoter, which is induced by low water potential in E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas syringae, was shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of Clavibacter michiganensis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. Surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in proU inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.
TI  - Investigations on anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergilli. The culture supernatant and lysates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli (BL21, DH5alpha, HB101, XL Blue), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptomyces thermonitrificans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. The lysate of Salm. typhi and E. coli BL21 exhibited the maximum activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. In disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of Salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against Aspergilli. Escherichia coli BL21 exhibited similar activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. The work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. CONCLUSION: The products of Salm. typhi and E. coli demonstrated significant activity against Aspergillus species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that E. coli has been reported for anti-Aspergillus activity. It could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.
TI  - The susceptibility of certain bacterial strains to imidazotriazine derivatives.
AB  - The synthesized imidazo[2,1-c]triazines were tested for their antimicrobial activity. Microbiological screening tests conducted in relation to 54 strains of Gram-positive and 52 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, 6 strains of yeast-like fungi and 3 strains of moulds showed significant activity of compound 19 against 52 Gram-negative bacterial strains. This compound was active against 16 strains of Escherichia coli, 12 strains of Pseudomonas, 10 strains of Proteus spp., 8 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 6 strains of Enterobacter aerogenes in the examined concentrations (100 microg ml(-1) and 200 microg ml(-1)).
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Aetiology of catheter-associated bacteriuria in Lagos University Teaching Hospital.
AB  - A prospective study to determine the causative agents of catheter-related bacteriuria was carried out on 99 patients with median age of 55 years, on admission in the Oncology, Paediatric Surgery and Obstetric and Gynaecology wards of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. There was significant bacteriuria in seventy-one (72%) of the 99 urine samples. All catheter urine samples were contaminated by day 5 Gram-negative bacilli were predominant (89.3%) of which Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.2%) was the most common, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes accounted for 15.5% each, closely followed by Proteus mirabilis (14.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.5%). The Gram positive isolates Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.4%) made up only 10.7% of isolates. Most of the isolates from catheterised patients were resistant to the common antibiotics such as ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin and ceftriaxone with high susceptibility to ofloxacin and ceftazidime though the isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was also resistant to ofloxacin. However, isolates of S. saprophyticus were still susceptible to the penicillins and tetracycline.
TI  - Gram-negative bacilli associated with catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated bloodstream infections and hand carriage by healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in neonatal intensive care units. This study describes the species of Gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections in two neonatal intensive care units, compares characteristics of catheter-related and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections, and compares species and antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms with those isolated from the hands of nurses working in the same neonatal intensive care units. DESIGN: Interventional study. SETTING: Two high-risk neonatal intensive care units. PATIENTS: Neonates hospitalized for >or =24 hrs. INTERVENTIONS: Prospective surveillance for bloodstream infections was performed in two neonatal intensive care units from March 2001 to January 2003. Hand cultures were obtained quarterly from participating nurses immediately after they performed hand hygiene. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 298 episodes of bloodstream infections among 2,935 admissions (5.75 episodes per 1,000 patient-days); 77 of 298 (26%) episodes were caused by Gram-negative bacilli. Among these, 47 (61.0%) were catheter-related bloodstream infections (2.61 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days). Eleven and 24 Gram-negative bacilli species were isolated from neonates and nurses, respectively. The most common Gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections were Klebsiella pneumoniae (38.7%), Escherichia coli (21.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (11.2%), and Serratia marcescens (11.2%). In contrast, Acinetobacter lwoffi (18.1%), K. pneumoniae (11.7%), E. cloacae (10.6%), K. oxytoca (10.6%), and Pseudomonas spp. (7.4%) were most commonly isolated from hands of nurses. E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and E. aerogenes were significantly more likely to cause bloodstream infections than to be isolated from nurses' hands (all p < .001). Although 39% of bloodstream infections were non-catheter-related, there were no significant differences in types of organisms or antimicrobial resistance patterns between catheter-related bloodstream infections and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections (all p > or = .35). Resistance patterns were similar between Gram-negative bacilli isolates from neonates and nurses' hands except for a significantly higher proportion of resistance to cefotaxime and gentamicin among neonatal isolates of K. pneumoniae (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli species isolated from neonatal bloodstream infections and nurses' hands varied significantly. Clean hands of providers are an unlikely source of endemic Gram-negative bacilli, suggesting that prevention strategies should focus more on control of endogenous neonatal flora or environmental sources.
TI  - Spread of novel expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae in a university hospital in the Paris area, France.
AB  - In 2002, 28 non-duplicate enterobacterial isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were collected from infected patients at the Bicetre Hospital in Paris, France. Escherichia coli was the predominant ESBL-positive enterobacterial species, comprising ten (36%) of the isolates. CTX-M enzymes (CTX-M-3, CTX-M-10, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15) were produced by 11 (39%) of the isolates (six E. coli, two Enterobacter cloacae, one Enterobacter aerogenes, one Proteus mirabilis and one Citrobacter freundii). Other ESBLs, such as VEB-1 and PER-1, were also detected, but less frequently.
TI  - Multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs).
AB  - In 1983, just two years after the introduction of the oxymino-beta-lactams to the market , the first extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were isolated in Germany from Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Since then several outbreaks have been reported in many European countries and the USA, and nowadays in several places worldwide the problem seems to reach endemic dimensions, with rates exceeding 50% in some countries, such as Portugal and Turkey. On the other hand not only K. pneumoniae but also Escherichia coli strains, with Enterobacter aerogenes predominating among the other enterobacteriaceal species, are increasingly reported as ESBL producers. In this review types, molecular characteristics, detection methods, epidemiology as well as interventions for therapy and antibiotic strategies to prevent and control infections caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms, are presented and discussed.
TI  - Antidiarrhoeal activity of the methanol extract of the barks of Xylocarpus moluccensis in castor oil- and magnesium sulphate-induced diarrhoea models in mice.
AB  - The methanol (MeOH) extract of the barks of Xylocarpus moluccensis, and different fractions of this extract were studied for antidiarrhoeal activity using castor oil- and magnesium sulphate-induced diarrhoea models in mice. At the doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg, the MeOH extract showed significant antidiarrhoeal activity in both models. The EtOAc fraction (EAF) and the residual MeOH fraction (RMF) exhibited similar activity using a dose of 250 mg/kg in both models. No antidiarrhoeal activity was observed with the chloroform fraction (CHF) at the test doses. When tested for antibacterial effect, the MeOH extract displayed moderate inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholera, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Shigella dysentery, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes. While the CHF inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus epidermis, Staphylococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the EAF was active against all test organisms except Vibrio cholera and Staphylococcus epidermis. The RMF inhibited the growth of all the test organisms with moderate zone of inhibition. On the basis of these findings, it can be assumed that Xylocarpus moluccensis could be a potential source for novel 'lead' discovery for antidiarrhoeal drug development.
TI  - The eefABC multidrug efflux pump operon is repressed by H-NS in Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - The Enterobacter aerogenes eefABC locus, which encodes a tripartite efflux pump,  was cloned by complementation of an Escherichia coli tolC mutant. E. aerogenes deltaacrA expressing EefABC became less susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics. Data from eef::lacZ fusions showed that eefABC was not transcribed in the various laboratory conditions tested. However, increased transcription from Peef was observed in an E. coli hns mutant. In addition, EefA was detected in E. aerogenes expressing a dominant negative E. coli hns allele.
TI  - Microbial partitioning to settleable particles in stormwater.
AB  - The degree to which microbes in the water column associate with settleable particles has important implications for microbial transport in receiving waters, as well as for microbial removal via sedimentation (i.e. detention basins). The partitioning behavior of several bacterial, protozoan and viral indicator organisms is explored in three urban streams under both storm and dry weather conditions. The fraction of organisms associated with settleable particles in stormwater is estimated through use of a centrifugation technique which is calibrated using suspensions of standard particles (e.g., glass, latex). The fraction of organisms associated with settleable particles varies by type of microbe, and the partitioning behavior of each organism generally changes between dry weather and storm conditions. Bacterial indicator organisms (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci) exhibited relatively consistent behavior, with an average of 20-35% of organisms associated with these particles in background samples and 30-55% in storm samples. Clostridium perfringens spores exhibited the highest average level of particle association, with storm values varying from 50% to 70%. Results related to total coliphage partitioning were more variable, with 20-60% associated with particles during storms. These estimates should be valuable in surface water quality modeling efforts, many of which currently assume that all microbes exist as free (unattached) organisms.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Increased expression of a bacterial phosphotriesterase in Escherichia coli through directed evolution.
AB  - We devised a growth-based strategy for screening phosphotriesterase mutant libraries for variants with enhanced activity towards organophosphates that generate dimethyl phosphate when hydrolysed. Phosphotriesterase mutants were screened for activity by growing transformed Escherichia coli on agar plates containing methyl paraoxon as a sole phosphorus source. E. coli is capable of growth under these conditions when coexpressing the phosphotriesterase from Agrobacterium radiobacter P230 (OpdA) and the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase from Enterobacter aerogenes (GpdQ). The latter enzyme can hydrolyse the dimethyl phosphate produced by the phosphotriesterase to methyl phosphate, which can then be used by E. coli as a source of phosphate. Phosphotriesterase was expressed from the lac promoter at levels such that its activity was growth-rate limiting. Cultures of the largest colonies (1% of the transformants) were assayed for activity towards paraoxon spectrophotometrically in microtitre plates. This process produced E. coli variants with higher whole cell activity than wild-type, which was found to be a consequence of increased protein expression rather than any increase in enzymatic activity. The mutations present in these mutant enzymes with increased expression were exclusively in the coding region, suggesting the improvement occurs post-transcriptionally.
TI  - Analysis of etiology and drug resistance of biliary infections.
AB  - The bile was collected from fro patients with biliary infections, with the bacterium isolated to study the sensitivity of each kind of the bacterium to several antibiotics in common use. Except G- bacterium, we also found some kinds of G+ bacterium in infection bile. G- bacterium were not sensitive to Clindamycin, G+ bacterium were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. Escherichia coli, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to Ampicillin. G+ bacterium were not sensitive to Azactam. Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae were not sensitive to Ceftazidime. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not sensitive to Ceftriaxone Sodium. We didn't found any bacterium resistance Imipenem. The possibility of the existence of G+ bacterium as well as drug resistance should be considered n patients with biliary infections. The value of susceptibility test should be respected to avoid drug abuse of antibiotics.
TI  - (1)H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  - The utility of (1)H NMR spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (UTI). The specific property of P. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-OHNA) is exploited. The quantity of 6-OHNA produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. The method provides a single-step documentation of P. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The NMR method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with UTI caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Beta-lactam screening by specific residues of the OmpF eyelet.
AB  - Beta-lactams use aqueous channels of porins to penetrate Gram-negative bacteria.  The L3 loop of Escherichia coli OmpF porin is a key feature that actively contributes to both channel size and electrostatic properties. Acid residues D113, E117, and D121 are responsible for the negative part of the local electrostatic field on this loop. Two substitutions, D113A and D121A, located in the negatively charged cluster of the OmpF eyelet, increase the likelihood of producing bacteria susceptible to several beta-lactams. D113A substitution results in an increase in the ampicillin, cefoxitin, and ceftazidime susceptibility. Molecular modeling suggests that the charges harbored by the beta-lactam molecules interact with the charged residues located inside the porin eyelet.
TI  - Chloramphenicol and expression of multidrug efflux pump in Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - Chloramphenicol has been reported to act as an inducer of the multidrug resistance in Escherichia coli. A resistant variant able to grow on plates containing 64 microg/ml chloramphenicol was obtained from the Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048-type strain. Chloramphenicol resistance was due to an active efflux of this antibiotic and it was associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and tetracycline, but not to aminoglycoside or beta-lactam antibiotics. MDR in the chloramphenicol-resistant variant is linked to the overexpression of the major AcrAB-TolC efflux system. This overexpression seems unrelated to the global Mar and the local AcrR regulatory pathways.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and specificity of the six human {alpha}-defensins.
AB  - We developed a kinetic, 96-well turbidimetric procedure that is capable of testing the antimicrobial properties of six human alpha-defensins concurrently on a single microplate. The defensins were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and tested against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli). Analysis of the growth curves provided virtual lethal doses (vLDs) equivalent to conventional 50% lethal doses (LD(50)s), LD(90)s, LD(99)s, and LD(99.9)s obtained from colony counts. On the basis of their respective vLD(90)s and vLD(99)s, the relative potencies of human myeloid alpha-defensins against S. aureus were HNP2 > HNP1 > HNP3 > HNP4. In contrast, their relative potencies against E. coli and E. aerogenes were HNP4 > HNP2 > HNP1 = HNP3. HD5 was as effective as HNP2 against S. aureus and as effective as HNP4 against the gram-negative bacteria in our panel. HD6 showed little or no activity against any of the bacteria in our panel, including B. cereus, which was highly susceptible to the other five alpha-defensins. The assay described provides a quantitative, precise, and economical way to study the antimicrobial activities of host-defense peptides. Its use has clarified the relative potencies of human alpha-defensins and raised intriguing questions about the in vivo function(s) of HD6.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in 45 crows in Ueno Zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 Escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) captured from July to  December 2002 at Ueno Zoo, Tokyo were identified as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas maltophila, Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. E. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). In an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of E. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. Several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were O8, O114 and O144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some netropsin analogues.
AB  - Nine novel lexitropsins were synthesized by linking two netropsin-like moieties through three different dicarboxylic acids; 9,10-dihydro-2,7-phenanthrenedicarboxylic acid; [(3-[[(carboxymethyl)amino]carbonyl]benzoyl)amino]acetic acid and indole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid. The netropsin residues were modified by the use of N-isopentylpyrrole, 5-methylthiophene or 5-isopropylthiazole heterocyclic building blocks in place of the usual N-methylpyrrole. The compounds were tested against five gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces faecalis, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Mycobacterium fortuitum, three gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and three fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Aspergillus nidulans. Some of the compounds showed significant inhibitory effects on the growth of the microorganisms.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the performance of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of various species. METHODS: Organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains comprising Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Enterobacter cloacae (10), Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (26), Klebsiella oxytoca (3) and Proteus mirabilis (4). Also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking ESBLs, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of AmpC enzyme in Citrobacter freundii (2), E. aerogenes (3), E. cloacae (3), E. coli (4), Hafnia alvei (1) and Morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase in K. pneumoniae (3) and E. coli (3) or hyperproduction of K1 enzyme in K. oxytoca (6). RESULTS: The MicroScan MIC-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 ESBL strains as ESBL-positive and 23 of 30 non-ESBL strains as ESBL-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). False negatives among ESBL producers were highest with Enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases. False-positive classifications occurred in two Acinetobacter spp., one E. coli producing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase and two K. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: The MicroScan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for ESBL confirmation. However, this test has limitations in detecting ESBLs in Enterobacter spp. and in discriminating ESBL-related resistance from the K1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp.
TI  - Detection of low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  - Biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. An antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. The principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture Listeria cells on the fiber. Capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. A cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, C11E9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by launching a 635-nm laser light from an Analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. This immunosensor was specific for L. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other Listeria species or other microorganisms, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Lactobacillus plantarum, Carnobacterium gallinarum, Hafnia alvei, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. Fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. The sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) CFU/ml for a pure culture of L. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees C. When L. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees C with 3.5% NaCl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) CFU/ml, respectively. In less than 24 h, this method could detect L. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 CFU/g after enrichment in buffered Listeria enrichment broth.
TI  - The AcrAB-TolC pump is involved in macrolide resistance but not in telithromycin  efflux in Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The role of the AcrAB-TolC pump in macrolide and ketolide susceptibility in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes was studied. Efflux pump inhibitor restored erythromycin, clarithromycin, and telithromycin susceptibilities to multidrug-resistant isolates. No modification of telithromycin accumulation was detected in E. aerogenes acrAB or tolC derivatives compared to that in the parental strain. Two independent efflux pumps, inhibited by phenylalanine arginine beta-naphthylamide, expel macrolides and telithromycin in E. aerogenes.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - RamA is an alternate activator of the multidrug resistance cascade in Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - Multidrug resistance (MDR) in Enterobacter aerogenes can be mediated by induction of MarA, which is triggered by certain antibiotics and phenolic compounds. In this study, we identified the gene encoding RamA, a 113-amino-acid regulatory protein belonging to the AraC-XylS transcriptional activator family, in the Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 type strain and in a clinical multiresistant isolate. Overexpression of RamA induced an MDR phenotype in drug-susceptible Escherichia coli JM109 and E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, as demonstrated by 2- to 16-fold-increased resistance to beta-lactams, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and quinolones, a decrease in porin production, and increased production of AcrA, a component of the AcrAB-TolC drug efflux pump. We show that RamA enhances the transcription of the marRAB operon but is also able to induce an MDR phenotype in a mar-deleted strain. We demonstrate here that RamA is a transcriptional activator of the Mar regulon and is also a self-governing activator of the MDR cascade.
TI  - Evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated the performance of a new ESBL Etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate ESBL Etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on Enterobacter spp. METHODS: Overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: Enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), Enterobacter cloacae (n=10), Escherichia coli (n=10), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and Proteus mirabilis (n=3). To check Etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to ESBL, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of K. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. RESULTS: With this panel, ESBL Etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. Concentrating on Enterobacter spp., reliable ESBL detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed ESBL production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of Enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. A limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with K1 phenotypes of K. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by Etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. CONCLUSION: The new Etest ESBL strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to current methods for detection of ESBLs. In our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of ESBLs, particularly in Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Sanitary and bacteriological aspects of sewage treatment.
AB  - A study into the removal of contamination load and indicator bacteria was carried out in 1992-1996 in the mechanical, biological and chemical waste-water treatment plant WTP in Lezany, in the County of Reszel, in the Province of Warmia and Mazury in Poland. The results of chemical analyses found a high efficiency of removal of carbon compounds, COD (90%) and BOD (98%), in the process of purification of household sewage. In addition, a high effectiveness of total nitrogen, on average 71%, and unsatisfactory removal of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were found. The results of microbiological analyses confirmed the high efficiency of removal of indicator bacteria in the process of sewage treatment from 94 to 97%. In the sewage after the final phase of purification in stabilization ponds, the following pathogenic bacteria were identified with the use of the EPL 21tests: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter georgoriae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Ervinia herbicola, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia odoriefra, Serratia marcescens, Providencia alcalifaciens, Hafnia alvei, Yersina pestis, Yersina pseudotuberculosis, Yersinia fredericksenii, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromons hydrophila, Pseudomonas aerulginosa. The obtained results show that although the sewage purification system is efficient and reduces the contamination load to the level required by the regulations (Ministry of Environmental Protection, Natural Resources and Forestry from 20 September 1991) and removes a great percentage of indicator bacteria, the purified sewage may be a source of pathogenic bacteria in inland waters.
TI  - Composition and the in vitro antimicrobial activities of the essential oils of some Thymus species.
AB  - The genus Thymus (Lamiaceae) is represented by 38 species (64 taxa) in Turkey, and 24 of which are endemic to Turkey. Aerial parts of Thymus longicaulis subsp. chaubardii var. chaubardii, T. zygioides var. lycaonicus, T. longicaulis subsp. longicaulis var. subisophyllus and T. pulvinatus collected from three different localities in Balikesir province were subjected to hydrodistillation to yield essential oils which were subsequently analysed by GC and GC/MS. The main constituents of the oils were identified, and antimicrobial bioassay was applied. Thymol (56.6%, 42.8%, 36.9%) was the main component in the oils of T. longicaulis subsp. chaubardii var. chaubardii (chemotype I), T. longicaulis subsp. chaubardii var. chaubardii (chemotype II) and T. zygioides var. lycaonicus respectively. The oil of T. longicaulis subsp. longicaulis var. subisophyllus contained carvacrol (60.0%) and the oil of T. pulvinatus borneol (27.9%) as main constituents.
TI  - Occurrence & detection of AmpC beta-lactamases at a referral hospital in Karnataka.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: AmpC beta-lactamases confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs except for cefepime, cefpirome and carbapenems. They are known to be responsible for nosocomial outbreaks, therapeutic failures and multidrug resistance. Although reported with increasing frequency the true rate of occurrence of these beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae is not known. Hence the present study was undertaken to determine the occurrence of AmpC enzymes among clinical isolates. METHODS: A total of 520 consecutive, non-repeat clinical isolates were included in the present study. Twenty eight strains resistant to cefoxitin were tested for AmpC beta-lactamases by the modified 3-dimensional extract method. Isolates harbouring AmpC beta-lactamases were tested for inducible beta-lactamases by disc diffusion. RESULTS: Sixteen (3.3%) isolates were positive for AmpC beta-lactamases. Based on the species 9 (3.3%) Escherichia coli, 4 (2.2%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 (5%) Citrobacter freundii and 1 (5.5%) isolate of Enterobacter aerogenes harboured AmpC enzymes. Nine (56.3%) of AmpC harbouring strains, were urinary isolates. All the isolates were sensitive to imipenem and variably sensitive to aminoglycosides and co-trimoxazole. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our findings document the presence of AmpC enzymes in this region. Hence AmpC beta-lactamase detection should be undertaken in clinical isolates showing resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins.
TI  - Growth of Escherichia coli coexpressing phosphotriesterase and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, using paraoxon as the sole phosphorus source.
AB  - Phosphotriesterases catalyze the hydrolytic detoxification of phosphotriester pesticides and chemical warfare nerve agents with various efficiencies. The directed evolution of phosphotriesterases to enhance the breakdown of poor substrates is desirable for the purposes of bioremediation. A limiting factor in the identification of phosphotriesterase mutants with increased activity is the ability to effectively screen large mutant libraries. To this end, we have investigated the possibility of coupling phosphotriesterase activity to cell growth by using methyl paraoxon as the sole phosphorus source. The catabolism of paraoxon to phosphate would occur via the stepwise enzymatic hydrolysis of paraoxon to dimethyl phosphate, methyl phosphate, and then phosphate. The Escherichia coli strain DH10B expressing the phosphotriesterase from Agrobacterium radiobacter P230 (OpdA) is unable to grow when paraoxon is used as the sole phosphorus source. Enterobacter aerogenes is an organism capable of growing when dimethyl phosphate is the sole phosphorus source. The enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing dimethyl phosphate has been previously characterized as a nonspecific phosphohydrolase. We isolated and characterized the genes encoding the phosphohydrolase operon. The operon was identified from a shotgun clone that enabled E. coli to grow when dimethyl phosphate is the sole phosphorus source. E. coli coexpressing the phosphohydrolase and OpdA grew when paraoxon was the sole phosphorus source. By constructing a short degradative pathway, we have enabled E. coli to use phosphotriesters as a sole source of phosphorus.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - Protistan grazing analysis by flow cytometry using prey labeled by in vivo expression of fluorescent proteins.
AB  - Selective grazing by protists can profoundly influence bacterial community structure, and yet direct, quantitative observation of grazing selectivity has been difficult to achieve. In this investigation, flow cytometry was used to study grazing by the marine heterotrophic flagellate Paraphysomonas imperforata on live bacterial cells genetically modified to express the fluorescent protein markers green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP). Broad-host-range plasmids were constructed that express fluorescent proteins in three bacterial prey species, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas putida. Micromonas pusilla, an alga with red autofluorescence, was also used as prey. Predator-prey interactions were quantified by using a FACScan flow cytometer and analyzed by using a Perl program described here. Grazing preference of P. imperforata was influenced by prey type, size, and condition. In competitive feeding trials, P. imperforata consumed algal prey at significantly lower rates than FP (fluorescent protein)-labeled bacteria of similar or different size. Within-species size selection was also observed, but only for P. putida, the largest prey species examined; smaller cells of P. putida were grazed preferentially. No significant difference in clearance rate was observed between GFP- and RFP-labeled strains of the same prey species or between wild-type and GFP-labeled strains. In contrast, the common chemical staining method, 5-(4,6-dichloro-triazin-2-yl)-amino fluorescein hydrochloride, depressed clearance rates for bacterial prey compared to unlabeled or RFP-labeled cells.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community and private health care centers.
AB  - In 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the Aquitaine region in France produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Among these were 19 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 Escherichia coli isolates; 3 Proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Providencia stuartii. ESBL producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes and 5 ambulatory patients. Seven different ESBLs were characterized. These mainly consisted of TEM-24 (25 isolates) and TEM-21 (9 isolates), but TEM-15 (2 isolates) and TEM-3, TEM-19, SHV-4, and CTX-M-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. Seven strains showed the coexistence of different TEM- and/or SHV-encoding genes, including a new SHV-1 variant, SHV-44, defined by the substitution R205L previously reported for SHV-3 in association with S238G. The epidemiology of the ESBL producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic DNA, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the ESBL, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the ESBL-encoding plasmids. Of the TEM-24-expressing strains, 18 were E. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in France. Of the TEM-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. Outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. The presence of ESBL producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. Our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in general practice.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four European countries, Canada, and the United States in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  - Access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. The present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in Europe (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain), Canada, and the United States to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. All but two isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of Proteus mirabilis from France and one isolate of Morganella morganii from Canada) were susceptible to imipenem. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for P. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except Italy. In contrast, susceptibility of E. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (Spain) to 94.0% (France); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (Spain) to 91.6% (United States). Among Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. Considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of Serratia marcescens and M. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. For S. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (France) to 94.1% (Italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (Germany) to 90.7% (Spain). Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of Enterobacteriaceae studied. The present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Evaluation of Oxoid combination discs for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the reliability of cefpirome/clavulanate (CD04) compared with ceftazidime/clavulanate (CD02) and cefotaxime/clavulanate (CD03) Oxoid combination discs for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in several Enterobacteriaceae isolates, including Enterobacter spp. METHODS: Overall, a total of 105 ESBL-positive [positive double-disc synergy test (DDST)] and 94 ESBL-negative (negative DDST) Gram-negative isolates were evaluated. Ninety-eight isolates were confirmed as ESBL-positive on the basis of the sequence alignments of the blaTEM and/or blaSHV gene amplification products, which matched with previously identified ESBLs. The phenotypic detection of ESBLs was performed by the three combination discs according to the NCCLS and BSAC methods. The CD04 disc was evaluated with the manufacturer's recommended zone size difference breakpoint of > or =4 mm. RESULTS: In Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., the sensitivities (%)/specificities (%) of CD02, CD03 and CD04 discs, and the combination of CD02 or CD04 discs, were, respectively, 88/92, 90/92, 95/84 and 100/82, while the corresponding figures were 94/100, 4/100, 94/100 and 100/100 in Enterobacter aerogenes. NCCLS and BSAC methods yielded concordant results in 99% of the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: CD04 and CD02 discs were the best combination for detection of ESBLs in our collection of Enterobacteriaceae isolates, including E. aerogenes.
TI  - Glom is a novel mitochondrial DNA packaging protein in Physarum polycephalum and  causes intense chromatin condensation without suppressing DNA functions.
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is packed into highly organized structures called mitochondrial nucleoids (mt-nucleoids). To understand the organization of mtDNA and the overall regulation of its genetic activity within the mt-nucleoids, we identified and characterized a novel mtDNA packaging protein, termed Glom (a protein inducing agglomeration of mitochondrial chromosome), from highly condensed mt-nucleoids of the true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. This protein could bind to the entire mtDNA and package mtDNA into a highly condensed state in vitro. Immunostaining analysis showed that Glom specifically localized throughout the mt-nucleoid. Deduced amino acid sequence revealed that Glom has a lysine-rich region with proline-rich domain in the N-terminal half and two HMG boxes in C-terminal half. Deletion analysis of Glom revealed that the lysine-rich region was sufficient for the intense mtDNA condensation in vitro. When the recombinant Glom proteins containing the lysine-rich region were expressed in Escherichia coli, the condensed nucleoid structures were observed in E. coli. Such in vivo condensation did not interfere with transcription or replication of E. coli chromosome and the proline-rich domain was essential to keep those genetic activities. The expression of Glom also complemented the E. coli mutant lacking the bacterial histone-like protein HU and the HMG-boxes region of Glom was important for the complementation. Our results suggest that Glom is a new mitochondrial histone-like protein having a property to cause intense DNA condensation without suppressing DNA functions.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in Buenos Aires, Argentina, public hospitals.
AB  - Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). In order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of ESBLs in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from April to May 2000. Extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. From a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards' Screening and Confirmatory Tests for ESBL production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-Lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and PCR amplification using specific primers. Three different ESBLs were detected: SHV-related (4 isolates), PER-2-type (9 isolates), and CTX-M-2-related (26 isolates). Sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed CTX-M-2 in 19 of 21 and CTX-M-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. CTX-M-2 (or its variant) was detected in all Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Providencia stuartii strains, while PER-2 was detected in Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; SHV-related ESBL were found only in K. pneumoniae. These results clearly show that CTX-M-2 is the most prevalent ESBL produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in Buenos Aires.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in a French university-affiliated hospital.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the epidemiology of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLE) in our hospital. We determined the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Enterobacteriaceae over a 2-year period. We also characterised ESBLs by isoelectric focusing (IEF) and investigated the epidemiological relatedness of EBLSE by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). During this period, 70 patients were colonised/infected with one or several strains of EBLSE, giving a crude incidence of 0.095 per 1000 patient-days. We found that ESBL-producing Enterobacter aerogenes were the main source of ESBLE dissemination. Indeed, 59.5% of ESBLE were E. aerogenes and 21.9% of the other ESBLE resulted from a plasmid transfer originating from E. aerogenes. IEF and PFGE analysis demonstrated that the dissemination of ESBL from E. aerogenes in our hospital was due to a single clone that always harbours TEM-24. This emphasises the importance of standard contact isolation precautions and the early detection of ESBLE-colonised patients in high risk departments like intensive care units.
TI  - Comparison of microbial adherence to antiseptic and antibiotic central venous catheters using a novel agar subcutaneous infection model.
AB  - An agar subcutaneous infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), was developed to assess the ability of antimicrobial catheters to resist microbial colonization. The catheters were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. The catheters implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21. The efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine impregnated (CS) catheters, CS catheters with higher levels of chlorhexidine (CS+ catheters), minocycline-rifampicin (MR) catheters and silver catheters against Staphylococcus aureus and rifampicin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis RIF-r2 was compared in the agar and rat models. No significant difference in the adherence or the drug release was found between the in vitro and in vivo models. In both models, CS+ and MR catheters were effective against S. aureus even when infected on day 14, whereas CS catheters were colonized when challenged on day 7. CS+ catheters were effective against S. epidermidis RIF-r2, whereas MR catheters showed adherence when infected on day 7. CS+ catheters prevented colonization of all the organisms including, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans in the agar model, whereas MR catheters were effective only against S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains. Silver catheters were ineffective against all the organisms. The agar model may be used to predict the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters against various pathogens.
TI  - Modification of the double-disk test for detection of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum and AmpC beta-lactamases.
AB  - Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae is problematic. A modification of the double-disk test (MDDT) has been developed for successful detection of ESBLs in gram-negative bacilli producing well-characterized beta-lactamases as well as 212 clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Citrobacter freundii. MDDT accurately differentiated between ESBL producers and derepressed chromosomal AmpC mutants. MDDT provides a cost-effective alternative approach for clinical microbiology laboratories for routine susceptibility testing with simultaneous detection of ESBLs in enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Genetic engineering of Enterobacter aerogenes with the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene: cell growth, survival, and antioxidant enzyme status under oxidative stress.
AB  - Hemoglobins in unicellular organisms, like the one here in the bacterium Vitreoscilla, have greater chemical reactivity than their homologues in multicellular organisms. They can catalyze redox reactions and may protect cells against oxidative stress. The ability of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin to complement deficiencies of terminal cytochrome oxidases in Escherichia coli also suggests that this hemoglobin can receive electrons during respiration. In this study, a recombinant strain of Enterobacter aerogenes engineered to produce the Vitreoscilla Hb was investigated with regard to its susceptibility to oxidative stress. The culture response to oxidative stress produced by exogenously applied hydrogen peroxide was characterized in terms of cell growth, survival and the activities of two key antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase). The influence of the physiological state of the cells and different media upon these culture dynamics was determined. Results showed that the hemoglobin-expressing strain is quite distinct in terms of growth/survival properties and activity of antioxidant enzymes from that of non-hemoglobin counterparts.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by E test.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by E test. We found that the MIC(50) and MIC(90) values against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae family except Serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (MIC range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. The susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for Escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although Serratia and Acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (MIC(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. We propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating Enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). These data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa), as well as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - Removal of inorganic and organic mercurials by immobilized bacteria having mer-ppk fusion plasmids.
AB  - Feasibility of biological mercury removal from wastewater was examined by using alginate-immobilized cells of Escherichia coli carrying mer-ppk fusion plasmid pMKB18. Immobilized cells engineered to express mercury-transport system, organomercurial lyase and polyphosphate efficiently removed organic and inorganic mercury from contaminated wastewater over a wide concentration range of mercurials, probably via intracellular accumulation mediated by ppk-specified polyphosphate. Bioaccumulation of mercury was selective compared to other metals such as Cd(2+), Pb(2+) and Cr(6+). The immobilized cells could be used repeatedly (at least three times) without large loss of mercury removal activity. From these results, it is concluded that the mer-ppk fusion plasmid and the immobilized cells are useful for simultaneous removal of organic and inorganic mercury from contaminated wastewater.
TI  - The beta-glucoside genes of Klebsiella aerogenes: conservation and divergence in  relation to the cryptic bgl genes of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The ability to metabolize aromatic beta-glucosides such as salicin and arbutin varies among members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The ability of Escherichia coli to degrade salicin and arbutin appears to be cryptic, subject to activation of the bgl genes, whereas many members of the Klebsiella genus can metabolize these sugars. We have examined the genetic basis for beta-glucoside utilization in Klebsiella aerogenes. The Klebsiella equivalents of bglG, bglB and bglR have been cloned using the genome sequence database of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Nucleotide sequencing shows that the K. aerogenes bgl genes show substantial similarities to the E. coli counterparts. The K. aerogenes bgl genes in multiple copies can also complement E. coli mutants deficient in bglG encoding the antiterminator and bglB encoding the phospho-beta-glucosidase, suggesting that they are functional homologues. The regulatory region bglR of K. aerogenes shows a high degree of similarity of the sequences involved in BglG-mediated regulation. Interestingly, the regions corresponding to the negative elements present in the E. coli regulatory region show substantial divergence in K. aerogenes. The possible evolutionary implications of the results are discussed.
TI  - Persistent silver disinfectant for the environmental control of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contaminated surfaces can act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and potentially exacerbate the risk of infection. Surface disinfection and decontamination provide temporary amelioration against bacterial colonization. Disinfected surfaces eventually become contaminated, thus, mitigating the benefit of the initial disinfection. It is hypothesized that to improve on the current state of the art, a disinfectant should not only immediately disinfect a surface but also provide persistent antimicrobial action after the product has been applied. We describe here a silver-based disinfectant technology designed to provide long-lasting sanitization and disinfection to treated surfaces as evaluated on hard surfaces after repeated environmental insults. METHODS: A comparative evaluation of 6 disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity after water rinsing was performed. Log reduction of bacterial populations on disinfectant-treated substrates were measured after 30 minutes to 8 hours of exposure and compared with an untreated control. In a similar study, the residual antimicrobial activity of a silver disinfectant was evaluated against antibiotic- and biocide-resistant bacteria also after water rinsing. Further, residual antimicrobial activity of the silver disinfectant was measured after 5 cycles of rinsing, abrasion, and contamination against representative household and nosocomial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, or Salmonella choleraesuis) after 10-minute exposure times. RESULTS: In the comparative assay, only the silver disinfectant and a persistent quaternary ammonium compound disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity (> or =3.0 log(10) reduction to control) against S aureus whereas only the silver disinfectant demonstrated activity against Pseudomonas. No residual activity (< or = 0.5 log reduction to untreated control) was observed for the other disinfectant products. The silver-based disinfectant also showed significant and equivalent efficacy against antibiotic- and silver-resistant bacteria. In addition, the silver disinfectant was able to achieve significant residual activity in 10 minutes against all organisms tested after 1, 3, and 5 cycles of water rinse, abrasion, and microbial contamination. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show the ability of a new silver-based disinfectant to reduce bacterial populations that contact treated surfaces within minutes, highlight the potential to interrupt cross-contamination from environmental surfaces, and reduce the risk of infection within the home and health care settings.
TI  - Biosynthesis of pyridoxine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae--origin of the pyridoxine  nitrogen atom differs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions.
AB  - The amide nitrogen atom of glutamine is incorporated into pyridoxine in four eukaryotes (i.e., Emericella nidulans, Mucor racemosus, Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and two prokaryotes (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis). However, in the prokaryotes Pseudomonas putida, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli, it is the nitrogen atom of glutamate that is incorporated into pyridoxine (J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (2000) 46, 55-57). As these results were from experiments conducted under aerobic conditions, we investigated the biosynthesis of pyridoxine on S. cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions. The results showed that [amide-15N]L-glutamine was not incorporated into pyridoxine, unlike the results for aerobic conditions. The incorporation of [15N]ammonium salts into pyridoxine was not inhibited in the presence of casamino acids and tryptophan. The results showed that the nitrogen atoms of amino acids are not used for the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. The incorporation of 15N into pyridoxine was inhibited in the presence of adenine, but not in that of hypoxanthine. Thus, the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine may be from the amino group attached to the C-6 of adenine.
TI  - Surfactant proteins A and D inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria by increasing membrane permeability.
AB  - The pulmonary collectins, surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D), have been reported to bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS), opsonize microorganisms, and enhance the clearance of lung pathogens. In this study, we examined the effect of SP-A and SP-D on the growth and viability of Gram-negative bacteria. The pulmonary clearance of Escherichia coli K12 was reduced in SP-A-null mice and was increased in SP-D-overexpressing mice, compared with strain-matched wild-type controls. Purified SP-A and SP-D inhibited bacterial synthetic functions of several, but not all, strains of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes. In general, rough E. coli strains were more susceptible than smooth strains, and collectin-mediated growth inhibition was partially blocked by coincubation with rough LPS vesicles. Although both SP-A and SP-D agglutinated E. coli K12 in a calcium-dependent manner, microbial growth inhibition was independent of bacterial aggregation. At least part of the antimicrobial activity of SP-A and SP-D was localized to their C-terminal domains using truncated recombinant proteins. Incubation of E. coli K12 with SP-A or SP-D increased bacterial permeability. Deletion of the E. coli OmpA gene from a collectin-resistant smooth E. coli strain enhanced SP-A and SP-D-mediated growth inhibition. These data indicate that SP-A and SP-D are antimicrobial proteins that directly inhibit the proliferation of Gram-negative bacteria in a macrophage- and aggregation-independent manner by increasing the permeability of the microbial cell membrane.
TI  - Modification of outer membrane protein profile and evidence suggesting an active  drug pump in Enterobacter aerogenes clinical strains.
AB  - Two clinical strains of Enterobacter aerogenes that exhibited phenotypes of multiresistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and kanamycin were investigated. Both strains showed a porin pattern different from that of a susceptible strain, with a drastic reduction in the amount of the major porin but with an apparently conserved normal structure (size and immunogenicity), together with overproduction of two known outer membrane proteins, OmpX and LamB. In addition, the full-length O-polysaccharide phenotype was replaced by a semirough Ra phenotype. Moreover, in one isolate the intracellular accumulation of chloramphenicol was increased in the presence of the energy uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, suggesting an energy-dependent efflux of chloramphenicol in this strain. The resistance strategies used by these isolates appear to be similar to that induced by stress in Escherichia coli cells.
TI  - Potential for detection of microorganisms and heavy metals in potable water using electronic nose technology.
AB  - Studies have been carried out to determine the potential for the detection of different microbial species (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), alone and in the presence of low concentrations of different heavy metals (As, Cd, Pb and Zn) in bottled, reverse osmosis (RO) and tap water, using an electronic nose. Studies show that it is possible to discriminate control water samples from water contaminated with 0.5 ppm of a mixture of metals. The presence of heavy metals may modify the activity of microorganisms and thus the volatile production patterns. Bacterial species at 10(2)-10(4) colony forming units (CFUs) ml(-1) could be detected after 24 h of incubation. Work is in progress to identify the limits of detection for a range of other microorganisms, including, fungi and cyanobacteria, and chlorinated phenols using electronic nose technology.
TI  - Characterization of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from Italy by the BD  Phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  - Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in Enterobacteriaceae: Identification of ESBLs based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. The Phoenix ESBL test (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, Md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria. An algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Citrobacter koseri. Of these isolates, 319 were identified as ESBL producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-ESBL producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. Combined use of isoelectric focusing, PCR, and/or DNA sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(TEM-1)- and/or bla(SHV-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(CTX-M) gene. Among the 191 non-ESBL-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an AmpC-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all K. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced K1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. The Phoenix ESBL test system gave positive results for all the 319 ESBL-producing isolates and also for two of the four K1-hyperproducing isolates of K. oxytoca. Compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the Phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. These findings suggest that the Phoenix ESBL test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of ESBL resistance in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Extended spectrum beta-lactamase mediated resistance in urinary tract isolates of family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) hydrolyse expanded spectrum cephalosporins like ceftazidime, cefotaxime and monobactam aztreonam. ESBL producing bacteria may not be detectable in the routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics and treatment failures. As information on ESBL producers causing urinary tract infection (UTI) is not available from our country, the occurrence of ESBL producing strains causing UTI was studied as also the differences between the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of ESBL and non-ESBL producers. METHODS: Urinary isolates (233) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by Stoke's method and ESBL production by double disk diffusion method (ceftazidime and clavulanic acid). The clinical and demographic profile of the patients was noted. RESULTS: Sixty two of the 233 isolates tested (26.6%) were ESBL producers. Approximately 38.5 per cent of Klebsiellae, 24.7 per cent of Escherichia coli, 24 per cent of Enterobacter aerogenes, 33.3 per cent of Proteus sp. and the only Citrobacter strain produced ESBL. Recent surgery was found to be a significant (P < 0.01) risk factor for acquisition of ESBLs. Approximately 30 per cent of the ESBL producers appeared falsely sensitive or moderately sensitive to cefotaxime/ceftazidime in routine susceptibility testing. There was no difference between the ESBL producers and non-producers in the susceptibility to non-beta lactam agents except for gentamicin. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: A high percentage of urinary tract isolates produced ESBL. Since they are likely to be missed in routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests, all microbiology laboratories should look for ESBL production routinely to avoid treatment failures.
TI  - Antiinflammatory property of 3-aryl-5-(n-propyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazoles and antimicrobial property of 3-aryl-5-(n-propyl)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles: their syntheses and spectroscopic studies.
AB  - The synthesis of six 3-aryl-5-(n-propyl)-4,5dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles 3a-f has been achieved in a facile manner by the reaction of an appropriate arylamidoxime 1a-f with butyraldehyde 2. Oxidation of 3a-f individually using MnO(2) in CH(2)Cl(2) or sodium hypochlorite in THF/H(2)O furnished 1,2,4-oxadiazoles 4a-f in good to excellent yields. Compounds 4a-f were also evaluated against inflammation. Except 4e, all of them reduced inflammation, however, 4c presented better antiinflammatory activity. A preliminary antimicrobial activity tests of 3a-f showed that these compounds possess activity against some microorganisms. In fact, 3c and 3f have been found to be more effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Candida albicans.
TI  - Overexpression and purification of the three components of the Enterobacter aerogenes AcrA-AcrB-TolC multidrug efflux pump.
AB  - The tripartite AcrA-AcrB-TolC system is the major efflux pump of the nosocomial pathogen Enterobacter aerogenes. AcrA is a trimeric periplasmic lipoprotein anchored in the inner membrane, AcrB is an inner membrane transporter and TolC is a trimeric outer membrane channel. In order to reconstitute the AcrA-AcrB-TolC system of E. aerogenes in artificial membranes, we overexpressed and purified the three proteins. The E. aerogenes acrA, acrB and tolC open reading frames were individually inserted in the expression vector pET24a(+), in frame with a sequence coding a C-terminal hexahistidine tag to allow purification by INAC (Immobilized Nickel Affinity Chromatography). The mature AcrA-6His was overproduced in a soluble form in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). AcrA-6His was purified under native conditions in two steps using INAC and gel permeation chromatography. We obtained about 25 mg of 97% pure AcrA-6His per liter of culture. AcrB-6His was solubilized from the membrane fraction of E. coli C43(DE3) in 300 mM NaCl, 5% Triton X-100 and purified in one step by INAC. The AcrB-6His enriched fraction was eluted with 100 mM imidazole. The final yield was 1-2 mg of 95% pure AcrB-6His per liter of culture. The membrane fraction of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS containing TolC-6His was first treated with 2% Triton X-100, 30 mM MgCl(2) to solubilize the inner membrane proteins. After ultracentrifugation, the pellet was treated with 5% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA to solubilize the outer membrane proteins. Approximately 5 mg of 95% pure TolC-6His trimers per liter of culture was purified by INAC.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of drugs for urinary tract infections by genotyping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
AB  - We attempted to determine whether the same bacterium isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections (UTI) before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents was of the same strain ("persisted") or of a different strain ("changed"). Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for UTI, we investigated whether bacterial strains could be classified as persisted or changed based on their electrophoretic patterns in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We examined eight species of bacteria ( Enterococcus avium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli), consisting of 41 strains (19 pairs isolated before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents) isolated from patients with complicated UTI. It was concluded that all bacteria were unchanged, based on the clinical effect on bacteriuria. The chromosomal DNA of these bacteria was digested with restriction enzymes and classified based on their electrophoretic pattern in PFGE. A comparison of the patterns of the fragments revealed that 14 pairs were indistinguishable before and after treatment, 3 pairs were closely related, 1 pair was possibly related, and 1 pair was different. These results demonstrated that 18 pairs of isolates (indistinguishable, closely related, and possibly related) were highly likely to be continued infections by the same strain, and that 1 pair (different) had been replaced by another strain. Based on these results, we believe that bacterium genotyping by PFGE is a more effective method for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Molecular characterization of amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance in a clinical isolate of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The resistance phenotype of the clinical isolate of Escherichia coli 1941 was characterized by high-level resistance to penicillins and to combinations amoxicillin-ticarcillin/clavulanate and ampicillin/sulbactam. This resistance was carried by the conjugative plasmid pEC1941 that encoded a beta-lactamase activity. The purified enzyme focused at pI 5.4 and was strongly inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid (IC50 = 0.09 microM). Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed identity between the plasmid borne blaTEM gene of E. coli 1941 and the blaTEM-1B gene, except for a single C-to-T substitution at position 32 in the promoter region leading to the overlapping promoters Pa and Pb. No alterations in the expression of outer membrane porins OmpC and OmpF have been detected. These findings show that the resistance of E. coli 1941 to the combinations of beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors is related to high-level production of TEM-1 enzyme expressed from the strong promoters Pa and Pb.
TI  - Carbapenem resistance in a clinical isolate of Enterobacter aerogenes is associated with decreased expression of OmpF and OmpC porin analogs.
AB  - We investigated the mechanism of imipenem resistance in Enterobacter aerogenes strain 810, a clinical isolate from the United States for which the imipenem MIC was 16 micro g/ml and the meropenem MIC was 8 micro g/ml. An imipenem-susceptible revertant, strain 810-REV, was obtained after multiple passages of the strain on nonselective media. For the revertant, the imipenem MIC was </=1 micro g/ml and the meropenem MIC was </=0.25 micro g/ml. Cefepime MICs also decreased from 8 to 1 micro g/ml; however, the MICs of ceftazidime (>/=128 micro g/ml), cefoxitin (>/=32 micro g/ml), and cefotaxime (>/=64 micro g/ml) remained the same. The beta-lactamase and porin profiles of the parent, the revertant, and carbapenem-susceptible type strain E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 were determined. Strains 810 and 810-REV each produced two beta-lactamases with pIs of 8.2 and 5.4. The beta-lactamase activities of the parent and revertant were similar, even after induction with subinhibitory concentrations of imipenem. While 810-REV produced two major outer membrane proteins of 42 and 39 kDa that corresponded to Escherichia coli porins OmpC and OmpF, respectively, the parent strain appeared to produce similar quantities of the 39-kDa protein (OmpF) but decreased amounts of the 42-kDa protein (OmpC). When the parent strain was grown in the presence of imipenem, the 42-kDa protein was not detectable by gel electrophoresis. However, Western blot analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the parent and revertant with polyclonal antisera raised to the OmpC and OmpF analogs of Klebsiella pneumoniae (anti-OmpK36 and anti-OmpK35, respectively) showed that strain 810 expressed only the 42-kDa OmpC analog in the absence of imipenem (the 39-kDa protein was not recognized by the anti-OmpF antisera) and neither the OmpC nor the OmpF analog in the presence of imipenem. The OmpC analog is apparently down-regulated in the presence of imipenem; however, 810-REV expressed both OmpC and OmpF analogs. These data suggest that imipenem resistance in E. aerogenes 810 is primarily associated with the lack of expression of the analogs of the OmpC (42-kDa) and OmpF (39-kDa) outer membrane proteins, which also results in decreased susceptibility to meropenem and cefepime.
TI  - prbA, a gene coding for an esterase hydrolyzing parabens in enterobacter cloacae  and Enterobacter gergoviae strains.
AB  - The new gene prbA encodes an esterase responsible for the hydrolysis of the ester bond of parabens in Enterobacter cloacae strain EM. This gene is located on the chromosome of strain EM and was cloned by several PCR approaches. The prbA gene codes for an immature protein of 533 amino acids, the first 31 of which represent a proposed signal peptide yielding a mature protein of a putative molecular mass of 54.6 kDa. This enzyme presents analogies with other type B carboxylesterases, mainly of eukaryotic origin. The cloning and expression of the prbA gene in a strain of Escherichia coli previously unable to hydrolyze parabens resulted in the acquisition of a hydrolytic capacity comparable to the original activity of strain EM, along with an increased resistance of the transformed strain to methyl paraben. The presence of homologues of prbA was tested in additional ubiquitous bacteria, which may be causative factors in opportunistic infections, including Enterobacter gergoviae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas agglomerans, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Burkholderia cepacia. Among the 41 total strains tested, 2 strains of E. gergoviae and 1 strain of Burkholderia cepacia were able to degrade almost completely 800 mg of methyl paraben liter(-1). Two strains of E. gergoviae, named G1 and G12, contained a gene that showed high homology to the prbA gene of E. cloacae and demonstrated comparable paraben esterase activities. The significant geographical distance between the locations of the isolated E. cloacae and E. gergoviae strains suggests the possibility of an efficient transfer mechanism of the prbA gene, conferring additional resistance to parabens in ubiquitous bacteria that represent a common source of opportunistic infections.
TI  - Method for estimation of low outer membrane permeability to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria plays a major role in beta-lactam resistance as it slows down antibiotic entry into the periplasm and therefore acts in synergy with beta-lactamases and efflux systems. Up to now, the quantitative estimation of low outer membrane permeability by the method of Zimmermann and Rosselet was difficult because of the secreted and cell surface-associated beta-lactamases. The method presented here uses the acylation of a highly sensitive periplasmic penicillin-binding protein (PBP) (BlaR-CTD) to assess the rate of beta-lactam penetration into the periplasm. The method is dedicated to measurement of low permeability and is only valid when the diffusion rate through the outer membrane is rate limiting. Cytoplasmic membrane associated PBPs do not interfere since they are acylated after the very sensitive BlaR-CTD. This method was used to measure the permeability of beta-lactamase-deficient strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aerogenes to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefotaxime, aztreonam, and cephacetrile. Except for that of cephacetrile, the permeability coefficients were equal to or below 10(-7) cm/s. For cephacetrile, carbenicillin, and benzylpenicillin, the outer membrane of E. cloacae was 20 to 60 times less permeable than that of Escherichia coli, whereas for cefotaxime, aztreonam, and ampicillin it was, respectively, 400, 1,000, and 700 times less permeable. The permeability coefficient for aztreonam is the lowest ever measured (P = 3.2 x 10(-9) cm/s). Using these values, the MICs for a beta-lactamase-overproducing strain of E. cloacae were successfully predicted, demonstrating the validity of the method.
TI  - Helicobacter pylori may survive ampicillin treatment in the remnant stomach.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a Gram-negative curved rod-like or spiral bacterium that chronically infects the human gastric mucosa, and is a major risk factor for gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer and adenocarcinoma of the stomach. After partial gastrectomy, some patients may have persistent H. pylori infection for five years or more. In this study, we detected three bacteria, i.e., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli, in the gastric juice of patients with a remnant stomach. Some of these bacteria produced beta-lactamase. These findings are potentially important since such bacteria could provide H. pylori with the chance to acquire drug resistance and to transfer drug resistance genes. This could be one reason why H. pylori is difficult to eradicate in the remnant stomach.
TI  - BUT-1: a new member in the chromosomal inducible class C beta-lactamases family from a clinical isolate of Buttiauxella sp.
AB  - An atypical Enterobacteriaceae strain with a beta-lactam susceptibility pattern of inducible cephalosporinase was isolated in Tenon Hospital (Paris, France) from a patient's skull wound infection. Identifications by the API-50CHE biochemical system and 16S rRNA gene sequencing concluded that it was a member of the Buttiauxella genus. The bla gene was cloned and sequenced. The deduced translated product was a 383-amino acid protein (BUT-1) with 75-78% identity with the chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli. The isoelectric point of 9.0 and the kinetic constants of BUT-1 were comparable with results described for other Ambler class C enzymes. bla(BUT-1) and the associated ampR transcriptional regulator gene were divergently transcribed from a common intercistronic region, a genetic organization already described for other inducible class C beta-lactamases. The deduced amino acid sequence of AmpR shared 85% and 81% identity with AmpR from E. cloacae and C. freundii respectively.
TI  - The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump contributes to multidrug resistance in the nosocomial  pathogen Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - We identified the genes encoding the AcrA-AcrB-TolC efflux pump in Enterobacter aerogenes and constructed acrAB and tolC mutants from a multidrug-resistant isolate. Both derivatives were more susceptible to antibiotics than the parental strain. Sequence analysis and complementation experiments revealed that the multidrug-resistant isolate is an acrR mutant.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Development of a sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting and quantifying CMY-2 and SHV beta-lactamases.
AB  - Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against SHV-1 and CMY-2 beta-lactamases were produced and characterized, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were developed. Immunoblots revealed that the anti-SHV-1 antibody recognized SHV-1 but did not recognize TEM-1, K-1, OXA-1, or any AmpC beta-lactamase tested. The anti-CMY-2 antibody detected Escherichia coli CMY-2, Enterobacter cloacae P99, Klebsiella pneumoniae ACT-1, and the AmpC beta-lactamases of Enterobacter aerogenes, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter freundii. No cross-reactivity of the anti-CMY-2 antibody was seen against laboratory strains of E. coli possessing TEM-1, SHV-1, K-1, or OXA-1 beta-lactamases. Operating conditions for performing ELISAs were optimized. Both anti-CMY-2 and anti-SHV-1 antibodies detected picogram quantities of purified protein in ELISAs. The reactivity of the anti-CMY-2 antibody was tested against a number of AmpC beta-lactamases by assaying known quantities of purified enzymes in ELISAs (AmpC beta-lactamases of M. morganii, C. freundii, E. coli, and E. cloacae). As the homology to CMY-2 beta-lactamase decreased, the minimum level needed for detection increased (e.g., 94% homology recognized at 1 ng/ml and 71% homology recognized at 10 ng/ml). The ELISAs were used to assay unknown clinical isolates for AmpC and SHV beta-lactamases, and the results were confirmed with PCR amplification of bla(AmpC) and bla(SHV) genes. Overall, we found that our ELISAs were at least 95% sensitive and specific for detecting SHV and AmpC beta-lactamases. The ELISA format can facilitate the identification of AmpC and SHV beta-lactamases and can be used to quantify relative amounts of beta-lactamase enzymes in clinical and laboratory isolates.
TI  - [Total and fecal coliforms, some enterobacteria staphylococcus sp. and moulds in  salads for hot dogs sold in Maracay, Venezuela].
AB  - Fast food sold on the streets are good vehicle to transmit gastrointestinal diseases to consumers because they are highly manipulated. The vegetables are a good media for pathogens growth. Raw vegetables salads for hot dog sold in Maracay were studied. Total and fecal Coliforms and Staphylococcus sp. were quantified by the Most Probable Number Technique, Coliforms and Staphylococcus isolated were partially identified. Also the mould population was quantified and identified. Microbial growth was correlated with pH and acidity measurements. MPN/g of Total Coliforms was 1.44 x 10(5) and 4.57 x 10(4) for fecal Coliforms. E. coli was no detected. 87 isolated from the Coliforms were partially identified as Citrobacter freundii variety 1 (45.09% of the isolated), C. freundii variety II (21.57%), Enterobacter aerogenes variety I (17.65%) and E. aerogenes variety II (15.69%); Staphylococcus sp. 3.93 x 10(6) MPN/g and all of its isolated (52) were coagulase negative. The mould population was 4.5 x 10(4) ufc/g, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus, sp., Fusarium sp. were partially identified. The salads presented a pH of 5.92 and an acidity of 0.78 ml of NaOH.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of Enterobacter aerogenes OmpC-type osmoporin linked to carbapenem resistance.
AB  - Using outbreak-related strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, we cloned and sequenced ompK39, the structural gene coding for outer membrane protein OmpK39. Its lack of expression was closely associated with a phenotype exhibiting low-level carbapenem resistance. Detailed alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed that OmpK39 is a member of the OmpC subclass of enterobacterial porins, with the highest degree of homology to Klebsiella pneumoniae OmpK36. Based on a computerized alignment including Escherichia coli PhoE and OmpF, the 3D structures of which are known from X-ray studies, OmpK39 can be assumed to form the typical beta-barrel structure which is common to all enterobacterial porins. Since no inhibitory DNA sequences could be detected in ompk39 in the resistant strains, porin deficiency leading to carbapenem resistance seems to involve alterations in key regulatory genes and/or the promotor sequence rather than a direct mutation in the structural gene.
TI  - Pyogenic liver abscess -- 20 years' experience. Comparison of results of treatment in two periods.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Our aim is to give an audit of our experience over the past  two decades in the form of a retrospective study. PATIENTS/METHODS: In two equal periods between 01.01.1982 and 31.03.2001, 56 patients (37 males and 19 females) with pyogenic liver abscess were treated. Image-guided percutaneous drainage was performed in 22.2%/20.6% of the patients; the remainder were treated with open drainage with or without biliary tract reconstruction and liver resection. For antibiotic perfusion of the liver an umbilical vein cannula was inserted in 40.7%/24.1%. Microbiological findings, types of therapy, complications and mortality, etiology, patient characteristics, symptoms, and laboratory data were investigated. The results in the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The most common cause of abscess, biliary disease, was seen more often in the second period. Solitary liver abscesses were more frequent. The only characteristic biochemical finding was an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. There were more positive cultures in the second period (70.4%/79.3%), and the number of Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes infections also increased. In the first period the mortality was 18.5%, whereas in the second no patients were lost. CONCLUSION: We suggest the importance of individualized therapy based on an early and exact diagnosis. The first treatment step should be image-guided drainage, but under well-defined circumstances open drainage can also be performed with good results.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - Polyphosphate produced in recombinant Escherichia coli confers mercury resistance.
AB  - An Escherichia coli strain was generated by fusion of a merA-deleted broad-spectrum mer operon from Pseudomonas K-62 with a bacterial polyphosphate kinase gene (ppk) from Klebsiella aerogenes in vector pUC119. A large amount of the ppk-specified polyphosphate was identified in the mercury-induced bacterium with the fusion plasmid designated pMKB18 but not in the cells without mercury induction. These results suggest that the synthesis of polyphosphate as well as the expression of the mer genes is mercury-inducible and regulated by merR. The E. coli strain with pMKB18 was more resistant to both Hg2+ and C6H5Hg+ than its isogenic strain with cloning vector pUC119. The recombinant strain accumulated more mercury from Hg2+- and C6H5Hg+-contaminated medium. Hg2+ transported into the cytoplasm appeared to be bound by chelation with the polyphosphate produced by the recombinant cells. The transported phenylmercury was degraded to Hg2+ before the chelation since polyphosphate did not directly chelate with C6H5Hg+. These results indicate that polyphosphate is capable of reducing the cytotoxicity of the transported Hg2+ probably via chelation between polyphosphate and Hg2+.
TI  - Prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae: an Italian survey.
AB  - The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production by consecutive non-repeated isolates of Enterobacteriaceae was determined over a 6-month period. A total of 8015 strains were isolated from ten Italian laboratories and 509 (6.3%) of these were designated ESBL producers from the results of a double-disk synergy test. Escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Providencia stuartii (28.1%) was the most frequently isolated ESBL producer, followed by K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes (20.5%). However, amongst all ESBL producers, K. pneumoniae (38.2%) was the most represented followed by P. mirabilis (25.7%). All the strains positive to DD tests were confirmed for the carriage of TEM and SHV genes using colony-blot hybridisation (CH). A total of 447 strains (88.0%) were CH-positive, of which 42.3% hybridised with the TEM-type probe, 30.1% with the SHV-type probe and 15.6% with both probes. In conclusion, our findings indicate that 6.3% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested produced ESBLs, 42.3% of which were TEM-derived enzymes. More than 20% of P. stuartii, K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes harbour these enzymes. The double-disk test seems to be a useful test to identify ESBL producing strains.
TI  - Epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacter isolates  in a Spanish hospital during a 12-year period.
AB  - Fifteen Enterobacter clinical isolates (11 Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 3 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates, and 1 Enterobacter gergoviae isolate), representing 0.4% of all Enterobacter isolates recovered in our hospital from 1989 to 2000, were suspected of harboring an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). These isolates were recovered from 14 different patients. ESBLs were transferred by conjugation into an Escherichia coli recipient strain. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed a single clone of E. aerogenes and six different clones of E. cloacae. Four of these E. cloacae clonal types were represented by only one isolate each, but the other two were represented by three and four isolates, respectively. Isoelectric focusing, susceptibility phenotyping, PCR analysis, and sequencing demonstrated the presence of three different ESBLs. The most frequent was the recently characterized CTX-M-10 ESBL, which was found in the E. gergoviae isolate and in all but one of the E. cloacae isolates. The remaining E. cloacae isolate harbored a TEM-27 ESBL, and the three E. aerogenes isolates harbored a TEM-24 ESBL. PFGE revealed that our E. aerogenes strain was indistinguishable from the French TEM-24-producing E. aerogenes endemic clone. Although a low prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacter isolates was found in our institution over a 12-year period, a diversity of nonepidemic E. cloacae clones was detected, as was the persistence of the CTX-M-10 beta-lactamase. The presence of the TEM-24-producing E. aerogenes French clone in our institution also demonstrates the intercountry dissemination of ESBL-producing isolates.
TI  - mar Operon involved in multidrug resistance of Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - We determined the sequence of the entire marRAB operon in Enterobacter aerogenes. It is functionally and structurally analogous to the Escherichia coli operon. The overexpression of E. aerogenes MarA induces a multidrug resistance phenotype in a susceptible strain, demonstrated by a noticeable resistance to various antibiotics, a decrease in immunodetected porins, and active efflux of norfloxacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus in Italy: incidence and trends over the period 1997-1999.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and of  Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the respiratory tract was assessed over the period 1997-1999 as part of the Italian Epidemiological Observatory survey sponsored by the Smith-Kline Foundation. A standardised method was used to determine the MICs of 22 antibiotics against isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=870), Escherichia coli (n=684), Enterobacter cloacae (n=342), Enterobacter aerogenes (n=187) and Serratia marcescens (n=135) as well as the MICs of 11 antibiotics against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n=1,606). Overall, the susceptibility rate of Enterobacteriaceae isolates was > or = 90% to 5 agents (meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, cefepime and gentamicin); 89-80% to 2 agents (ciprofloxacin and tobramycin); and <80% to 11 agents (cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefetamet, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, tetracycline, piperacillin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, ticarcillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and amoxicillin). During the 3-year monitoring period, antibiotic susceptibility increased in Klebsiella pneumoniae against amoxicillin-clavulanate, in Escherichia coli against third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, in Enterobacter aerogenes against amoxicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam and in Serratia marcescens against most of the antibiotics. In contrast, Enterobacter cloacae showed a tendency to develop resistance to cefetamet, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Of the total number of Staphylococcus aureus strains, 38% were methicillin resistant. Nearly 80% of the methicillin-resistant strains displayed a multiresistance pattern (additional resistance to 2 or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics). Rates of susceptibility of particular species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus) were compared using strains from different geographical areas of Italy (northern, central and southern) and from different nosocomial areas (outpatients, intensive care unit [ICU] inpatients, non-ICU inpatients). Susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae to several antibiotics was lower in southern Italy, whereas the incidence of methicillin-resistant strains was higher in northern and central Italy. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli was similar in all three areas. No significant differences in susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae or Escherichia coli were found between strains from inpatients and outpatients or from inpatients admitted to ICU and non-ICU units. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was higher in ICU inpatients (52%) than in non-ICU inpatients (38%) and lower in outpatients (19%) than in inpatients.
TI  - Relationship between teat-end callosity and occurrence of clinical mastitis.
AB  - A longitudinal study in 15 herds, with a total of 2157 cows, was conducted to examine the relationship between teat-end callosity (TEC) and the incidence of clinical mastitis. During the 1.5-yr study period, clinical mastitis was diagnosed by the farmers based on clinical signs. Teat-end callosity was scored every month according to a teat-end callosity classification system, which discriminates between teat-end callosity thickness (TECT) and roughness (TECR). Differences in TECT between healthy and clinical mastitis quarters within infected cows were small but significant 3 mo before (0.13 higher), in the month during which the clinical mastitis occurred (0.08 higher), and in the following 2 mo (0.06 and 0.05 higher). To compare TECT and TECR between cows with and without clinical mastitis, 199 cows with clinical mastitis were paired with control cows based on herd, days in milk, and parity. Clinical mastitis cows had more TEC than their healthy herd mates, particularly when clinical mastitis occurred between the second and fifth months of lactation. Clinical Escherichia coli mastitis in the second or third month of lactation occurred in cows with less TEC than in cows with clinical mastitis caused by other pathogens. Clinical culture-negative, yeast, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes mastitis cows had more TECT and TECR than other cows with clinical mastitis in the same month of lactation. Pointed teat ends had higher TECT and TECR than flat or inverted teat ends. Teat-end callosity thickness increased with a higher milk yield at peak production.
TI  - Ethnobotanical and antimicrobial investigation on some species of Terminalia and  Combretum (Combretaceae) growing in Tanzania.
AB  - An ethnobotanical investigation on the medicinal uses of some species of Terminalia and Combretum (Combretaceae) was carried out in Mbeya, Tanzania during a 5-weeks field expedition. Of the sixteen species collected, Combretum fragrans F. Hoffm., Combretum molle G. Don., Combretum psidioides Welw., Combretum zeyheri Sond., Terminalia kaiserana F. Hoffm. and Terminalia sericea Burch ex. DC. have medical applications against various bacterial infections, such as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and against symptoms like diarrhoea, hypertension and even cancer. Antimicrobial screening of the crude extracts of the selected Combretum and Terminalia species was performed by the agar diffusion method. Among the most effective extracts were methanol extracts of the roots of Terminalia sambesiaca Engl. & Diels., T. kaiserana Guill. & Perrott., T. sericea Burch. ex DC., C. fragrans F. Hoffm. and Combretum padoides Engl. & Diels., all of which showed marked inhibition against Gram-positive bacteria, and were also good inhibitors of Enterobacter aerogenes. All four of the extracts of the roots of T. sericea tested, (methanol, ethanol, acetone and hot water) had good antimicrobial activity. A methanolic leaf extract of T. kaiserana was the only extract to have a bacteriocidic effect on Escherichia coli. Methanol root extracts of T. sambesiaca and methanol leaf extracts of T. sericea were the most effective against Candida albicans. The results of the antimicrobial screening support the ethnomedical uses of these plants.
TI  - Evaluation of ppk-specified polyphosphate as a mercury remedial tool.
AB  - To evaluate the utility of polyphosphate kinase gene (ppk)-specified polyphosphate in mercury remediation, a fusion plasmid, pMK27, with ppk from Klebsiella aerogenes and mercury transport genes, merT and merP, from Pseudomonas K-62, was constructed. The transcription and translation of ppk, merT and merP were found to be mercury-inducible. The ppk-specified polyphosphate was identified in cells preinduced by Hg2+, but not in cells without mercury induction, suggesting that the synthesis of polyphosphate is regulated by merR. The hypersensitive phenotype to Hg2+, shown by bacteria with pMRD141, which contains merT and merP, was almost completely restored to its original levels when the ppk was introduced into the plasmid, suggesting that the Hg2+-toxicity was reduced by the polyphosphate, probably via chelation formation. Bacteria with pMK27 accumulated approximately 6-fold more mercury than the bacteria with cloning vector, pUC119. These results clearly demonstrate that the polyphosphate is capable of retaining mercury in the cells without taxing the cells. Based on the results obtained in the present study, the fusion plasmid pMK27 may serve as a strategy for mercury remediation.
TI  - Shellac formulations to reduce epiphytic survival of coliform bacteria on citrus  fruit postharvest.
AB  - Survival of the coliform bacteria Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli was monitored in a neutral carboxymethylcellulose formulation and in shellac formulations with various pH and concentrations of ethanol and the preservative paraben; populations were subsequently measured from the surface of citrus fruit coated with these formulations. Numbers of the two bacteria increased over 24 h from 10(6) CFU/ml to approximately 10(8) CFU/ml in the carboxymethylcellulose solution, but over this time numbers remained little changed in the neutral solution of shellac. The Enterobacter was more tolerant of alcohol over a 3-h period: although its numbers in a shellac solution with 10% ethanol dropped from more than 10(6) CFU/ml to just over 10(3) CFU/ml. E. coli and a third species. Klebsiella pneunoniae, declined toward the limit of detection (5 CFU/ ml) during this time. The addition of morpholine to increase the formulation pH to 9.0 caused numbers of bacteria to plummet to an undetectable level within 30 to 60 min. On Ruby Red grapefruit and Valencia oranges in storage at 13 degrees C numbers of E. aerogenes and E. coli declined over 2 weeks from 10(5) CFU/cm2 to less than 2.5 x 10(1), but most of the loss in numbers occurred within 1 day. Numbers remained significantly less on shellacked fruit compared with those applied in the carboxymethylcellulose coating, and a shellac coating prepared from a pH 9 solution was more toxic to these species than one in which 12% ethanol had been added to the neutral formulation. The addition of the preservative paraben in the basic shellac was further inhibitory.
TI  - New pyridoquinoline derivatives as potential inhibitors of the fluoroquinolone efflux pump in resistant Enterobacter aerogenes strains.
AB  - Enterobacter aerogenes, one of the most frequently isolated nosocomial pathogens  in France, is exhibiting increasing multidrug resistance mechanisms associated with a change in membrane permeability. For drugs of the quinolone family, mutations in the target and active efflux play a prominent role in the resistance. We report here the effect of several pyridoquinoline derivatives that restore a noticeable fluoroquinolone accumulation to resistant strains that overexpress the MarA activator. Studies of the energy-dependent quinolone efflux indicate that the most efficient derivatives tested probably inhibit the resistance process by acting as substrate competitors on the pump extruding intracellular norfloxacin.
TI  - Roles of glutamate synthase, gltBD, and gltF in nitrogen metabolism of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  - Mutants of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella aerogenes that are deficient in glutamate synthase (glutamate-oxoglutarate amidotransferase [GOGAT]) activity have difficulty growing with nitrogen sources other than ammonia. Two models have been proposed to account for this inability to grow. One model postulated an imbalance between glutamine synthesis and glutamine degradation that led to a repression of the Ntr system and the subsequent failure to activate transcription of genes required for the use of alternative nitrogen sources. The other model postulated that mutations in gltB or gltD (which encode the subunits of GOGAT) were polar on a downstream gene, gltF, which is necessary for proper activation of gene expression by the Ntr system. The data reported here show that the gltF model is incorrect for three reasons: first, a nonpolar gltB and a polar gltD mutation of K. aerogenes both show the same phenotype; second, K. aerogenes and several other enteric bacteria lack a gene homologous to gltF; and third, mutants of E. coli whose gltF gene has been deleted show no defect in nitrogen metabolism. The argument that accumulated glutamine represses the Ntr system in gltB or gltD mutants is also incorrect, because these mutants can derepress the Ntr system normally so long as sufficient glutamate is supplied. Thus, we conclude that gltB or gltD mutants grow slowly on many poor nitrogen sources because they are starved for glutamate. Much of the glutamate formed by catabolism of alternative nitrogen sources is converted to glutamine, which cannot be efficiently converted to glutamate in the absence of GOGAT activity. Finally, GOGAT-deficient E. coli cells growing with glutamine as the sole nitrogen source increase their synthesis of the other glutamate-forming enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase, severalfold, but this is still insufficient to allow rapid growth under these conditions.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - Electrochemical biosensor array for the identification of microorganisms based on lectin-lipopolysaccharide recognition.
AB  - Rapid identification of bacterial strains remains a well-known problem in applied medicine and, for viable pathogens, is an important diagnostic goal. We have investigated an electrochemical biosensor array, in which transduction is based on respiratory cycle activity measurements, where the microorganism's native respiratory chain is interrupted with non-native external oxidants. The selective biochemical recognition agents employed in this study are lectins that, once immobilized, recognize and bind to cell surface lipopolysaccharides. Porous membranes with different surface properties were examined as potential immobilization supports for these lectins. Optimizations performed using concanavalin A and E. coli JM105 show that immobilization methods involving pre-activated membranes significantly reduce the time required to create a functional lectin layer on the membrane surface. Overall, we found general agreement between agglutination test results and the electrochemical assessment of lectin-cell binding. Chronocoulometric measurements were made for cells captured on lectin-modified Immunodyne ABC membranes physically affixed to Pt working electrodes. This lectin-based sensor array was exposed to viable cells of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as yeast, and chronocoulometric measurements were used to generate a pattern of responses for each organism toward each lectin. Principal component analysis was used to classify the chronocoulometric results for the different microbial strains. With this new method, six microbial species (Baccilus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were readily distinguished.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence and organization of the atrazine catabolic plasmid pADP-1 from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP.
AB  - The complete 108,845-nucleotide sequence of catabolic plasmid pADP-1 from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP was determined. Plasmid pADP-1 was previously shown to encode AtzA, AtzB, and AtzC, which catalyze the sequential hydrolytic removal of s-triazine ring substituents from the herbicide atrazine to yield cyanuric acid. Computational analyses indicated that pADP-1 encodes 104 putative open reading frames (ORFs), which are predicted to function in catabolism, transposition, and plasmid maintenance, transfer, and replication. Regions encoding transfer and replication functions of pADP-1 had 80 to 100% amino acid sequence identity to pR751, an IncPbeta plasmid previously isolated from Enterobacter aerogenes. pADP-1 was shown to contain a functional mercury resistance operon with 99% identity to Tn5053. Complete copies of transposases with 99% amino acid sequence identity to TnpA from IS1071 and TnpA from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes were identified and flank each of the atzA, atzB, and atzC genes, forming structures resembling nested catabolic transposons. Functional analyses identified three new catabolic genes, atzD, atzE, and atzF, which participate in atrazine catabolism. Crude extracts from Escherichia coli expressing AtzD hydrolyzed cyanuric acid to biuret. AtzD showed 58% amino acid sequence identity to TrzD, a cyanuric acid amidohydrolase, from Pseudomonas sp. strain NRRLB-12227. Two other genes encoding the further catabolism of cyanuric acid, atzE and atzF, reside in a contiguous cluster adjacent to a potential LysR-type transcriptional regulator. E. coli strains bearing atzE and atzF were shown to encode a biuret hydrolase and allophanate hydrolase, respectively. atzDEF are cotranscribed. AtzE and AtzF are members of a common amidase protein family. These data reveal the complete structure of a catabolic plasmid and show that the atrazine catabolic genes are dispersed on three disparate regions of the plasmid. These results begin to provide insight into how plasmids are structured, and thus evolve, to encode the catabolism of compounds recently added to the biosphere.
TI  - Verbalactone, a new macrocyclic dimer lactone from the roots of Verbascum undulatum with antibacterial activity.
AB  - A novel macrocyclic dimer lactone, named verbalactone, was isolated from the roots of Verbascum undulatum and exhibited interesting antibacterial activity. It is the first time that 1,7-dioxacyclododecane is reported as the ring system of a natural product. The structure and the absolute stereochemistry of the new compound were determined by spectral methods and chemical correlation.
TI  - Etiologies of the urinary tract infections in a Yemeni City.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the causative agents of urinary tract infection in Yemeni patients in Sana'a city, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities of these agents in vitro. METHODS: Consecutive mid-stream urine specimens were submitted to our laboratory by 4029 patients in Sana'a city from 1990 to the end of 1999. The specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined (in vitro). RESULTS: The number of patients with urinary tract infection who yielded positive cultures from their mid stream urine specimens was 685 out of 4029 patients (17%). The ratio of female-to-male patients was 462:223 (2.07:1). The causative agents were mainly members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 579 out of the 685 isolates (84.5%). Escherichia coli was the main pathogen, 357 isolates out of all the isolates (52%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 143 isolates (21%) and Proteus species, 56 isolates (8%). The other pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Corynebacterium urealyticum and Enterococcus faecalis) constituted 129 out of the 685 isolates (19%). There was a shift in the types of the causative agents of urinary tract infection between the first and 2nd halves of the study period. The isolation of Escherichia coli decreased from 60% in the first half to 42% in the 2nd. Whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 16% in the first half to 27% in the 2nd, Proteus species from 8% to 9%, Staphylococcus aureus from 5% to 7%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 3% to 7%, Enterobacter aerogenes from 3% to 3.5%, Staphylococcus saprophyticus from 2% to 3% and Corynebacterium urealyticum from 1% to 2%. Ninety percent of all the urinary pathogens were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 75% to nitrofurantoin, 57% to gentamicin, 46% to cefaclor, 46% to nalidixic acid, 39% to doxycycline, 37% to co-trimoxazole and 20% to ampiclox. CONCLUSION: The types of urinary tract pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in addition to the rate of isolation from male and female patients are reported. It is recommended that ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin or both are used in the blind treatment of urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. It is also recommended to continuously monitor the pattern of urinary pathogens from the community to guide the blind treatment of patients in the future.
TI  - UV Raman spectral intensities of E. coli and other bacteria excited at 228.9, 244.0, and 248.2 nm.
AB  - Resonance Raman spectral intensities per average bacterial cell have been measured quantitatively for Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes, as well as Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spectra have been obtained from cultures in the lag, log, and stationary growth phases excited in turn by 228.9, 244.0, and 248.2 nm light. Although Raman spectral peak positions (cm(-1)) excited by a given wavelength are very similar for all five bacterial species, the organisms are characterized by significantly different spectral intensity values. Intensity changes are associated with growth phase changes in all of the species as well. A comparison of measured with estimated average intensities has been made for spectra of log-phase E. coli. It is possible to compare measured intensities with intensities estimated for log-phase E. coli on the basis of the knowledge of its known average cellular molecular composition. A significant degree of hypochromism is observed in E. coli nucleic acid spectra. In contrast, strong average hyperchromism characterizes all aromatic amino acid peaks belonging to the same E. coli cells. Results suggest that knowledge of spectral intensity values will enhance significantly the capability to identify bacteria by means of their UV resonance Raman spectra.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Phenotypic variability of beta-glucoside utilization and its correlation to pathogenesis process in a few enteric bacteria.
AB  - Utilization of beta-glucosides is markedly variable in the members of the family  Enterobacteriaceae. The results presented here provide molecular clues for evolutionary events that resulted in the phenotypic variability seen amongst the members of these species. The genomic hybridization of selected Enterobacteriaceae members with the Escherichia coli bgl and cel genes resulted in detection of a complete homolog of the bgl and cel operons in Shigella sonnei, a member that is evolutionarily closest to E. coli. However, the Salmonella group of organisms have been shown to carry only a homolog of bglR and bglG regions and the deletions of the bglF and bglB genes. Similarly, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and a non-enteric Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to carry a homolog of the bglR and bglG regions and deletions of the bglF and bglB genes. The homolog of the cel operon could be identified in S. sonnei and Salmonella groups of organisms. Possible implications of these observations, in connection with the phenotypic variability seen in beta-glucoside utilization amongst these members, are discussed.
TI  - Evidence of in vivo transfer of a plasmid encoding the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24 and other resistance factors among different members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The epidemiological study of several multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from five patients demonstrated in vivo dissemination of a 100-kb plasmid encoding the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24 from a clonal strain of Enterobacter aerogenes to different strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - H(2)O(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may contribute to inhibition of  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
AB  - In an accompanying report, we showed that viridans group streptococci may prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization of the oral cavities of newborns. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of prevention in vitro. Most viridans group streptococci had bacteriocin-like activity and killed MRSA, Burkholderia cepacia, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida albicans were resistant. The activity was induced only by H(2)O(2)-secreting strains and was inhibited by horseradish peroxidase or catalase in a dose-dependent manner. The mean concentration of H(2)O(2) produced by 18 strains of viridans group streptococci (1 x 10(8) cfu in 200 microL of culture medium+/-standard deviation was 1.24+/-0.60 mmol. Viridans group streptococci inhibited MRSA growth in saliva as well as in culture media. These results indicate that H(2)O(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may inhibit MRSA colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
TI  - Cloning and characterisation of malE in Burkholderia pseudomallei.
AB  - No recombinant protein is available for serodiagnosis or skin test in the diagnosis of melioidosis. This report describes the cloning of the malE gene, which encodes an immunogenic protein of Burkholderia pseudomallei. Bi-directional DNA sequencing of malE revealed that the gene contained a single open reading frame encoding 416 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 44.4 kDa. BLAST analysis showed that the putative protein encoded by malE is homologous to the maltose-binding protein (MBP) of other bacteria. It has 48% and 63% amino acid identity and similarity with the MBP of Brucella abortus, and malE complementation assay showed that it partially complemented the function of the MBP of Escherichia coli. Several highly conserved regions among the MBP of B. pseudomallei, Br. abortus, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes were observed. These regions represent signatures A, B, C, D and F identified in the MBP of E. coli. Further sequence analysis revealed that the first 24 amino acid residues of the MBP of B. pseudomallei probably represent the N-terminal signal peptide of the protein. Similar to the signal peptide of the MBP of E. coli, Ent. aerogenes and S. Typhimurium, the MBP of B. pseudomallei contains two basic residues in the first eight amino acids, followed by a hydrophobic core, with the last three amino acids in the signal peptide being Ala-Gln-Ala, conforming to the consensus sequence Ala-X-Ala at positions -3 to -1 relative to the site of proteolytic cleavage for recognition by signal peptidase I. Further studies on serodiagnosis of melioidosis with recombinant MBP should be performed.
TI  - Functional characterisation of urease accessory protein G (ureG) from potato.
AB  - The activation of the nickel metalloenzyme urease is a complex process. In bacteria, several urease accessory proteins are essential for incorporation of nickel into the active centre of urease. Comparatively little is known about the activation process and the proteins involved in plants. We cloned five different cDNAs encoding isoforms of urease accessory protein G (ureG) in potato. The 5'-coding region of these cDNAs is highly polymorphic within Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum, containing mainly a simple sequence repeat encoding histidine and aspartate. Mapping on an ultrahigh-density map of the potato genome and Southern blot analysis showed that the isoforms arise from allelic differences of a single-copy gene which was located on chromosome 2. Expression analysis at the mRNA and protein levels indicated the presence of ureG in almost all tissues examined, consistent with the ubiquitous expression of urease. An attempt to correlate urease activity with ureG expression levels in different tissues was made. Allelic copies of ureG were expressed in a tissue-specific manner. UreG from potato and the Klebsiella aerogenes urease operon defective in bacterial ureG were co-expressed in Escherichia coli. The plant gene complements the K. aerogenes ureG mutation, demonstrating that it encodes a urease accessory protein and indicating a structural conservation between the plant and the bacterial urease activation complexes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol isolated from Magnolia officinalis.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of Magnolia officinalis was investigated. The antimicrobial activity was assayed by the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined for each compound using a twofold serial dilution assay. The results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (MIC = 25 microg/mL) against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (MIC > or = 100 microg/mL) for Shigella flexneii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. Hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Molecular characterization of global regulatory RNA species that control pathogenicity factors in Erwinia amylovora and Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  - rsmB(Ecc) specifies a nontranslatable RNA regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. This effect of rsmB(Ecc) RNA is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of RsmA(Ecc), an RNA-binding protein of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. To determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmB(Ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing Erwinia species, we cloned the rsmB genes of E. amylovora (rsmB(Ea)) and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmB(Ehg)). We show that rsmB(Ea) in E. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production, motility, and pathogenicity. In E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmB(Ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of EPS and yellow pigment as well as motility. RsmA(Ea) and RsmA(Ehg) have more than 93% identity to RsmA(Ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. The rsmB genes reverse the negative effects of RsmA(Ea), RsmA(Ehg), and RsmA(Ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. These observations and findings that rsmB(Ea) and rsmB(Ehg) RNA bind RsmA(Ecc) indicate that the rsmB effect is channeled via RsmA. Additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmB genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a RsmA(+) strain of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its RsmA(-) derivative. E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmB transcript that is not subject to processing. By contrast, E. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmB transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmB(Ecc). Southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmB homologs in E. carotovora, E. chrysanthemi, E. amylovora, E. herbicola, E. stewartii and E. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Y. pseudotuberculosis. A comparison of rsmB sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmB RNA.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of Ferulago essential oils.
AB  - Essential oils from Ferulago asparagifolia Boiss., F. galbanifera (Miller) W. Koch, F. humilis Boiss. (Endemic), F. trachycarpa Boiss. growing in Turkey were evaluated against 15 microorganisms for their antifungal and antibacterial activity using an agar tube dilution and microdilution broth susceptibility assay, respectively. The essential oil compositions were investigated by GC/MS. Inhibitory effects against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Candida albicans, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Sclerotium rolfsii and Fusarium moniliforme were remarkable. Results are discussed in comparison with the chemical composition of the essential oils.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates against a new aminoglycoside isepamicin.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: isepamicin is a new aminoglycoside with a spectrum of  activity similar to amikacin with an advantage of possessing a high level of stability against different aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. the in vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates obtained from patients admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi during October-December, 1999 was tested against isepamicin and compared with other aminoglycosides. METHODS: a total of 251 clinical isolates were studied which included Escherichia coli 87, Klebsiella pneumoniae 54, Pseudonomas aeruginosa 38, Staphylococcus aureus 27 (methicillin resistant S. aureus 15, methicillin sensitive S. aureus 12), Acinetobacter species 26, Enterobacter aerogenes 9, Proteus mirabilis 5, Proteus vulgaris 2, and Citrobacter species 3. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against isepamicin and other aminoglycosides including amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin was done using NCCLS guidelines. The cut-off values of isepamicin were used as that of amikacin. RESULTS: we found that overall 153 nosocomial isolates were sensitive to isepamicin as compared to 95 for amikacin in this hospital. Isepamicin showed a superior in vitro activity compared to the other aminoglycosides tested. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: isepamicin can be a good alternative in multidrug resistant nosocomial isolates in hospitals where amikacin resistance is emerging.
TI  - Methionine-to-cysteine recycling in Klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  - In the enteric bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, sulfate is reduced to sulfide and assimilated into the amino acid cysteine; in turn, cysteine provides the sulfur atom for other sulfur-bearing molecules in the cell, including methionine. These organisms cannot use methionine as a sole source of sulfur. Here we report that this constraint is not shared by many other enteric bacteria, which can use either cysteine or methionine as the sole source of sulfur. The enteric bacterium Klebsiella aerogenes appears to use at least two pathways to allow the reduced sulfur of methionine to be recycled into cysteine. In addition, the ability to recycle methionine on solid media, where cys mutants cannot use methionine as a sulfur source, appears to be different from that in liquid media, where they can. One pathway likely uses a cystathionine intermediate to convert homocysteine to cysteine and is induced under conditions of sulfur starvation, which is likely sensed by low levels of the sulfate reduction intermediate adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate. The CysB regulatory proteins appear to control activation of this pathway. A second pathway may use a methanesulfonate intermediate to convert methionine-derived methanethiol to sulfite. While the transsulfurylation pathway may be directed to recovery of methionine, the methanethiol pathway likely represents a general salvage mechanism for recovery of alkane sulfide and alkane sulfonates. Therefore, the relatively distinct biosyntheses of cysteine and methionine in E. coli and Salmonella appear to be more intertwined in Klebsiella.
TI  - Alternative pathways for siroheme synthesis in Klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  - Siroheme, the cofactor for sulfite and nitrite reductases, is formed by methylation, oxidation, and iron insertion into the tetrapyrrole uroporphyrinogen III (Uro-III). The CysG protein performs all three steps of siroheme biosynthesis in the enteric bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. In either taxon, cysG mutants cannot reduce sulfite to sulfide and require a source of sulfide or cysteine for growth. In addition, CysG-mediated methylation of Uro-III is required for de novo synthesis of cobalamin (coenzyme B(12)) in S. enterica. We have determined that cysG mutants of the related enteric bacterium Klebsiella aerogenes have no defect in the reduction of sulfite to sulfide. These data suggest that an alternative enzyme allows for siroheme biosynthesis in CysG-deficient strains of Klebsiella. However, Klebsiella cysG mutants fail to synthesize coenzyme B(12), suggesting that the alternative siroheme biosynthetic pathway proceeds by a different route. Gene cysF, encoding an alternative siroheme synthase homologous to CysG, has been identified by genetic analysis and lies within the cysFDNC operon; the cysF gene is absent from the E. coli and S. enterica genomes. While CysG is coregulated with the siroheme-dependent nitrite reductase, the cysF gene is regulated by sulfur starvation. Models for alternative regulation of the CysF and CysG siroheme synthases in Klebsiella and for the loss of the cysF gene from the ancestor of E. coli and S. enterica are presented.
TI  - Drug Resistance in Bacteria Isolated From a Brazilian Hospital.
AB  - Bacteria commonly associated with cases of hospital infection were isolated from  samples of food, from food handless, and from objects and surfaces from different places of a hospital in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and the resistance patterns to antibiotic of these strains of bacteria were evaluated. The resistance patterns of these bacteria showed a large variation, and a high frequency of resistance to ampicillin (60.9%), cephalothin (58.7%) and carbenicillin (52.2%) was observed. The frequency of resistance to cephalosporins of 3rd and 4th-generations was 26.1% and 17.4% of the samples, respectively. Resistance to more than two drugs was observed in 27 samples (56.5%), and in four strains multiple resistance to 17 or more tested drugs was recorded. Five bacteria which were multi-resistant to antibiotics (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus sp, Pseudomonas sp and Staphylococcus aureus) were studied to determine the chromosomal or plasmidial genetic basis of the resistance, using plasmid curing and agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmidial DNA. It was possible to verify that for the antibiotics chloramphenicol and kanamycin, the resistance seems to be of plasmidial origin.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - [Sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. Evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study, conducted in the French Military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from nosocomial infection in intensive care units. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study has been conducted from January to December 1998 in all the intensive care units of the French Army. All the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. Beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. Antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "Comite Francais de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie". RESULTS: A total of 849 strains are included in this study. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by Escherichia coli (19%) Staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) (11%) and Enterococci (7%). Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). Gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. Resistance to III generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (BLSE) in 36% of cases. This BLSE could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. The most frequent species producing BLSE were Enterobacter aerogenes (75% of BLSE) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). Among the 172 P. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. Seventy per cent of the 96 CoNS and 50.2% of the 126 S. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. A strain of S. aureus and 2 CoNS strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. Twenty per cent of the 59 Enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of E. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. One strain of E. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. High rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among P. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among Enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. The implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of enterobacteria in intensive care units].
AB  - Antibiotic therapy of intensive care patients is usually undocumented. The treatment is chosen according to epidemiologic and susceptibility data from microbiological laboratories. The aim of our study is to determine antibiotic susceptibility of enterobacteria isolated from intensive care patients during a five-month multicenter study in 18 French hospitals. Numerous (n = 1,113) strains were studied: 447 enterobacteria isolated from urine (n = 229), blood cultures (n = 106), respiratory tract specimens (n = 72), peritoneal fluids (n = 22), pus (n = 15) and catheters (n = 2). MICs of group 2 and group 3 enterobacteria were determined using the dilution agar method and were interpreted according to the CASFM (Comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiology) recommendations. Group 1 enterobacteria were most frequently isolated (67%). Only one Escherichia coli strain produced ESBL (0.3%). Among group 2 enterobacteria, one Citrobacter koseri strain produced ESBL. We did not isolate Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBL. Isolation of group 3 enterobacteria was frequent (24%). Thirty-five percent of group 3 enterobacteria were resistant to cefotaxime, 26% to ceftazidime and 16% to cefepime and cefpirome. Fourteen strains of this group produced ESBL: 13 Enterobacter aerogenes and one E. amnigenus.
TI  - Biosynthesis of pyridoxine: origin of the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine in microorganisms.
AB  - The amide nitrogen atom of glutamine was incorporated into pyridoxine in four eukaryotes, Emericella nidulans, Mucor racemosus, Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and two prokaryotes, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, but not in the following prokaryotes, Pseudomonas putida, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. On the other hand, the nitrogen atom of glutamate was incorporated into pyridoxine in P. putida, E. aerogenes and E. coli, but not in S. aureus and B. subtilis. These results suggest that there are at least two different biosynthetic routes for pyridoxine and the difference does not depend on prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the UDP-sugar hydrolase gene (ushA) of Enterobacter aerogenes IFO 12010.
AB  - A bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP, the phoA gene product) is primarily responsible for the hydrolysis of the substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate-p-toluidine (XP) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). Using these substrates and an E. coli phoA mutant, we have cloned Enterobacter aerogenes genes conferring an XP(+) phenotype. Two types of clones were identified based on phenotypic tests and DNA sequences. One of them is a E. aerogenes phoA gene (XP(+), pNPP(+)) as expected; surprisingly the other one was found to be a ushA gene (XP(+), pNPP(-)), which encodes an UDP (uridine 5'-diphosphate)-sugar hydrolase. The E. aerogenes ushA gene shares high sequence identity with ushA of E. coli and the mutationally silent ushA0 gene of Salmonella typhimurium at both the nucleotide (over 79%) and amino acid (over 93%) levels. Expression of the E. aerogenes ushA gene in E. coli produced high level of UDP-sugar hydrolase, as confirmed by TLC (thin layer chromatography) analysis together with a presence of a strong band due to a XP hydrolysis on a polyacrylamide gel.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in a consecutive collection of clinical isolates of Enterobacter spp. The abilities of various screening methods to detect ESBLs in enterobacters were simultaneously tested. Among the 68 consecutive isolates (56 Enterobacter cloacae and 12 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates) that were analyzed for beta-lactamase content, 21 (25 and 58%, respectively) possessed transferable ESBLs with pIs of 8.2 and phenotypic characteristics of SHV-type enzymes, 8 (14.3%) of the E. cloacae isolates produced a previously nondescribed, clavulanate-susceptible ESBL that exhibited a pI of 6.9 and that conferred a ceftazidime resistance phenotype on Escherichia coli transconjugants, and 2 E. cloacae isolates produced both of these enzymes. Among the total of 31 isolates that were considered ESBL producers, the Vitek ESBL detection test was positive for 2 (6.5%) strains, and the conventional double-disk synergy test (DDST) with amoxicillin-clavulanate and with expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam was positive for 5 (16%) strains. Modifications of the DDST consisting of closer application of the disks (at 20 instead of 30 mm), the use of cefepime, and the use of both modifications increased the sensitivity of this test to 71, 61, and 90%, respectively. Of the 37 isolates for which isoelectric focusing failed to determine ESBLs, the Vitek test was false positive for 1 isolate and the various forms of DDSTs were false-positive for 3 isolates.
TI  - Convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  - A simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of IMP-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. Two Kirby-Bauer disks containing ceftazidime (CAZ) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. Several IMP-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and EDTA were evaluated for this test. Two CAZ disks were placed on a Mueller-Hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of the CAZ disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. For IMP-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was observed for CAZ-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as AmpC or SHV-12. As a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block IMP-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and CAZ-resistant strains producing AmpC or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from IMP-1 producers by this test. A similar observation was made with IMP-1-producing clinical isolates such as Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter spp., and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of PCR analysis using bla(IMP)-specific primers. Therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.
TI  - Production of a TEM-24 plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase by a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Several Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, including one urinary isolate producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24, were isolated from a long-term-hospitalized woman. Three TEM-24-producing enterobacterial species (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis) were isolated from the same patient. TEM-24 and the resistance markers for aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and sulfonamide were encoded by a 180-kb plasmid transferred by conjugation into E. coli HB101.
TI  - Comparison of five beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial pathogens using the time above MIC at different creatinine clearances.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T>MIC) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (Clcr). INTERVENTIONS: Serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at Clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. The MIC data for 90% of organisms (MIC90) were collected for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean MIC90 was calculated. The T>MIC was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean MIC90. A T>MIC of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except S. aureus (> or = 50%). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (Clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (Clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable T>MIC for all Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus at every Clcr. Imipenem 0.5 g achieved desirable T>MIC for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, and S. aureus at every Clcr. However, imipenem T>MIC was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: S. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 90 ml/min), E. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 80 ml/min), E. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 100 ml/min), S. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-70 ml/min), E. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-70 ml/min), and E. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 50-70 ml/min). Ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (Clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable T>MIC for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. aureus only. At every dose and Clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable T>MIC for S. aureus but not for any Enterobacteriaceae at Clcr > 50 ml/minute. Piperacillin did not achieve desirable T>MIC for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a T>MIC of 70% or above for P. aeruginosa at any Clcr. CONCLUSION: At every Clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable T>MIC for more nosocomial pathogens than any other beta-lactam evaluated. Based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. However, when P. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.
TI  - Molecular characterisation of the dnaK operon of Lactobacillus sakei LTH681.
AB  - The use of lactobacilli as starter organisms in food fermentation processes requires thorough knowledge of their reaction to the multitude of ecological factors including their response to stress. We have characterised the dnaK gene region of Lactobacillus sakei LTH681. Two chromosomal EcoRI fragments of 2.5 and 4.0 kb were identified using a homologous dnaK probe generated by PCR. The sequence analysis of the cloned fragments showed that the dnaK gene region consists of four heat shock genes with the organisation hrcA-grpE-dnaK-dnaJ. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed high similarity to the corresponding heat shock proteins of Gram-positive bacteria. An upstream located orfY was found which exhibited substantial similarity (41.5%) to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase of Enterobacter aerogenes. Northern hybridisation analysis revealed that the transcription of the genes is induced by heat shock (42 degrees C) as well as salt (6%) or ethanol (10%) stress. Several transcripts were detected including a polycistronic mRNA of 4.9 kb which represents the transcript of the complete dnaK gene region indicating a tetracistronic organisation of the dnaK operon. The other RNA fragments were identified as shorter transcripts (3.7 and 1.3 kb) or cleavage products of the polycistronic mRNAs. The transcription start sites of the dnaK operon were determined under inducing and non-inducing conditions. The site varied with the applied stress condition. A regulatory CIRCE element was identified located between the transcription and translation start site. The promoter region including CIRCE was transcriptionally fused to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene gusA and expressed in L. sakei LTH681. The kinetics of transcriptional induction of gusA by heat shocking were identical to those of the dnaK operon confirming the involvement of the CIRCE element in regulation of gene expression.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of several parts of Pinus brutia, Juniperus oxycedrus, Abies cilicia, Cedrus libani and Pinus nigra.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities of several parts of various trees grown in the Kahramanmaras region of Turkey were investigated by the disc diffusion method. Chloroform, acetone and methanol extracts of leaves, resins, barks, cones and fruits of Pinus brutia Ten., Juniperus oxycedrus L., Abies cilicia Ant. & Kotschy Carr., Cedrus libani A. Rich. and Pinus nigra Arn. were prepared and tested against Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Bacillus cereus FMC 19, Escherichia coli DM, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 3, Enterobacter aerogenes CCM 2531, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Proteus vulgaris FMC 1, Listeria monocytogenes Scoot A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 5007, Candida albicans CCM 314, Candida tropicalis MDC 86 and Penicillium italicum K. The results showed that antifungal effects were not observed for the whole extracts, E. coli was not inhibited by any of the plant extracts except by the chloroform and acetone extracts of the leaves of A. cilicia, which showed inhibition zones of 16-18 mm, respectively. All the plant extracts used in this study inhibited the development of the other bacteria studied. When the results of this study were compared with an ampicillin standard, it was found that the microorganisms studied were generally susceptible, intermediate or resistant to the extracts of species when compared with the ampicillin standard. On the other hand, the acetone and methanol extracts of Juniperus fruits were found to be quite resistant.
TI  - Verifying apple cider plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point programs: choice of indicator bacteria and testing methods.
AB  - The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the survival of coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterococci in refrigerated apple cider; (ii) to develop simple and inexpensive presumptive methods for detection of these bacteria; (iii) to perform a field survey to determine the prevalence of these bacteria on apples and in apple cider; and (iv) based on our results, to recommend the most useful of these three indicator groups for use in verifying apple cider processing plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) programs. Eight of 10 coliform strains (5 E. coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, and 2 Klebsiella spp.) inoculated into preservative-free apple cider (pH 3.4, 13.3(o) Brix) survived well at 4 degrees C for 6 days (< or = 3.0 log10 CFU/ml decrease). Of 21 enterococci strains (Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. durans), only 2 E. durans and 3 E. faecium strains survived well. Simple broth-based colorimetric methods were developed that detected the presence of approximately 10 cells of coliforms or enterococci. In three field studies, samples of unwashed apples (drops and picked), washed apples, and freshly pressed cider were presumptively analyzed for total coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci using qualitative and/or quantitative methods. Drop apples were more likely than picked apples to be contaminated with E. coli (26.7% vs. 0%) and enterococci (20% vs. 0%). Washing had little effect on coliform populations and in one field study was associated with increased numbers. Total coliform populations in cider ranged from < 1 CFU/ml to > 738 most probable number/ml, depending on the enumeration method used and the sample origin. E. coli was not recovered from washed apples or cider, but enterococci were present on 13% of washed apple samples. The qualitative coliform method successfully detected these bacteria on apples and in cider. Based on its exclusively fecal origin, good survival in apple cider, and association with drop apples, we conclude that E. coli is the most useful organism for verifying apple cider sanitation and HACCP programs.
TI  - Impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  - Evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. However, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. From 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of Acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens to 22 agents. Linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. Only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing D, decreasing %S) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing D, increasing %S). The mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing D, decreasing %S and decreasing D, increasing %S relationships. Multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.
TI  - The bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Gram-positive organisms, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. Other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with Staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent of the isolates. Listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic neonates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and Escherichia coli from 7 per cent. Other Gram-negative bacilli cultured were Enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella sp., and Proteus sp. (2 per cent each). The bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. The study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of Listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. It highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.
TI  - Comparative study on the in vitro antibacterial activity of Australian tea tree oil, cajuput oil, niaouli oil, manuka oil, kanuka oil, and eucalyptus oil.
AB  - To compare the antibacterial activity of the Australian tea tree oil (TTO) with various other medicinally and commercially important essential myrtaceous oils (cajuput oil, niaouli oil, kanuka oil, manuka oil, and eucalyptus oil) the essential oils were first analysed by GC-MS and then tested against various bacteria using a broth microdilution method. The highest activity was obtained by TTO, with MIC values of 0.25% for Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella choleraesuis, Shigella flexneri, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and S. xylosus. It is noteworthy that manuka oil exhibited a higher activity than TTO against gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values of 0.12%. Both TTO and manuka oil also demonstrated a very good antimicrobial efficacy against various antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to all essential oils tested, even at the highest concentration of 4%.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (FOM) and Citrobacter freundii. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (MINO). While Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (CMZ). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-negative bacilli. However, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), CMZ, latamoxef (LMOX), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK) showed good activities against some of the Gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. In conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
TI  - Bacterial pollution of cutting fluids: a risk factor for occupational diseases.
AB  - An outbreak of occupational diseases involving 38 metal workers with local infections on the hands and the face (53%), bronchitis (29%), and bronchopneumonia (18%) urged an examination of 150 samples of emulsions which the workers used in processing metals. Among the isolated bacteria, the most frequent was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48%), followed by Escherichia coli (44%), Proteus spp. (11%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Enterobacter aerogenes (7%), Citrobacter spp. (5%), Shigella spp., Staphylococcus aureus (3%), and the sulphite reducing Clostridia (1%). Moulds and yeasts were isolated from all tested samples. Most samples counted about 3 x 10(5)/ml of colony forming units. It was concluded that all emulsions and other substances which come in direct contact with the workers should be regularly monitored. Furthermore, preservatives should be added to prevent microbial infection.
TI  - Use of microdilution panels with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors as a phenotypic test for beta-lactamase production among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - Over the past decade, a number of new beta-lactamases have appeared in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae that, unlike their predecessors, do not confer beta-lactam resistance that is readily detected in routine antibiotic susceptibility tests. Because optimal methodologies are needed to detect these important new beta-lactamases, a study was designed to evaluate the ability of a panel of various beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors to discriminate between the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, high levels of K1 beta-lactamase, and other beta-lactamases in 141 isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens possessing well-characterized beta-lactamases. The microdilution panels studied contained aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, with and without 1, 2, and 4 microg of clavulanate per ml or 8 microg of sulbactam per ml and cefoxitin and cefotetan with and without 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. The results indicated that a minimum panel of five tests would provide maximum separation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase high AmpC, high K1, and other beta-lactamase production in Enterobacteriaceae. These included cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftriaxone plus 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. Ceftriaxone plus 2 microg of clavulanate per ml could be substituted for cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml without altering the accuracy of the tests. This study indicated that tests with key beta-lactam drugs, alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, could provide a convenient approach to the detection of a variety of beta-lactamases in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - The effects of plant phenolics, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid on arylamine N-acetyltransferase activities in human gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  - The possible effects of naturally occurring plant phenolics, caffeic acid (CA), chlorogenic acid (CGA) and ferulic acid (FA) on arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activities on human gastrointestinal microflora, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter koseri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined. The bacterial NAT activities were determined by HPLC measuring the acetylation of 2-aminofluorene (2-AF). Among all examined bacteria, P. aeruginosa exerted the highest NAT activity while C. koseri possessed the lowest NAT activity. CA, CGA and FA could suppress the bacterial NAT activities dose-dependently both in the intact cell and cytosolic fraction analysis. According to the analysis of kinetic parameters in E. coli and P. aeruginosa, CA, CGA and FA were shown to be potent noncompetitive inhibitors of bacterial NAT activities. For the time course experiment, 4 mM of CA and FA could inhibit bacterial NAT activities for at least 4 hour but 4 mM of CGA could only significantly suppress NAT activity in E. coli for the same reaction time. These results strongly demonstrated that CA, CGA and FA inhibited NAT activities in human gastrointestinal bacteria.
TI  - Alanine dehydrogenase from Enterobacter aerogenes: purification, characterization, and primary structure.
AB  - Alanine dehydrogenase [EC 1. 4. 1. 1] was purified to homogeneity from a crude extract of Enterobacter aerogenes ICR 0220. The enzyme had a molecular mass of about 245 kDa and consisted of six identical subunits. The enzyme showed maximal activity at about pH 10.9 for the deamination of L-alanine and at about pH 8.7 for the amination of pyruvate. The enzyme required NAD+ as a coenzyme. Analogs of NAD+, deamino-NAD+ and nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide served as coenzymes. Initial-velocity and product inhibition studies suggested that the deamination of L-alanine proceeded through a sequential ordered binary-ternary mechanism. NAD+ bound first to the enzyme, followed by L-alanine, and the products were released in the order of ammonia, pyruvate, and NADH. The Km were 0.47 mM for L-alanine, 0.16 mM for NAD+, 0.22 mM for pyruvate, 0.067 mM for NADH, and 66.7 mM for ammonia. The Km for L-alanine was the smallest in the alanine dehydrogenases studied so far. The enzyme gene was cloned into Escherichia coli JM109 cells and the nucleotides were sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence was very similar to that of the alanine dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis. However, the Enterobacter enzyme has no cysteine residue. In this respect, the Enterobacter enzyme is different from other alanine dehydrogenases.
TI  - The effect of oestrus and the presence of pouch young on aerobic bacteria isolated from the pouch of the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii.
AB  - Qualitative changes in the culturable, aerobic bacterial flora isolated from the  tammar pouch have been documented over the period leading up to oestrus, at the time of anticipated birth and in absence and presence of pouch young of varying ages. In a group of 12 animals studied thirty species of aerobic bacteria were isolated. Twenty five species were found in pouches with no pouch young, 9 in pouches with young less than 3 weeks of age and 9 in pouches containing older animals. Gram positive organisms including Corynebacterium spp., Micrococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequent isolates, regardless of reproductive status. Whilst Gram-negative rods Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli were found in pouches with and without pouch young, but not in pouches close to oestrus, at the time of birth or in the presence of very young animals (< 6 days). While pouches without pouch young displayed the greatest diversity of bacterial species, there were still significant numbers of bacterial species in those containing pouch young. Results suggest that the microbial population of the tammar pouch does not seriously compromise the well-being of the young animal during crucial stages of immunological development. The data are consistent with observations on the microflora of the quokka pouch but not with data from the koala.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nottingham, UK, 1985-1996.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. In this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. Particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. The incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. A total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. Staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas Escherichia coli (6%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella aerogenes (3.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. The two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. Bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). The overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. Surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of Enterobacter cloacae. It is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.
TI  - gyrA mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Fluoroquinolone resistance (FQ-R) in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. Two mechanisms of FQ-R have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in DNA gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. A single point mutation in gyrA has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. To determine the extent of gyrA mutations associated with FQ-R in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the QRDRs from 8 Enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens. Although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of E. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyrA QRDR were highly conserved. Conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the QRDRs of the susceptible type strains of C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca (Ser-83 to Thr), and P. stuartii (Asp-87 to Glu). Strains with ciprofloxacin MICs of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the Gly-81, Ser-83, or Asp-87 position. Fluoroquinolone MICs varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyrA mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyrA contribute to resistance. The type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. High-level FQ-R frequently was associated with single gyrA mutations in all species of Enterobacteriaceae in this study except E. coli.
TI  - Sequence comparison of the EcoHK31I and EaeI restriction-modification systems suggests an intergenic transfer of genetic material.
AB  - The genes coding for the EcoHK31I and EaeI restriction-modification (R-M) systems from Escherichia coli strain HK31 and Enterobacter aerogenes, respectively, have been cloned and sequenced. Both ENases recognize and cleave Y/GGCCR leaving 4 nucleotide 5'-protruding ends, while the MTases modify the internal cytosine. The systems were isolated on a 2.3kb AseI fragment for EcoHK31I, and a 4.6 kb HindIII fragment for EaeI. The R and M genes of both systems converge and overlap by 14 nucleotides. Previously, we found that M.EcoHK31I consisted of two subunits, (alpha and beta), with the beta subunit being translated from an alternative open reading frame within the gene encoding the alpha subunit. Sequence comparison between the EcoHK31I and EaeI systems reveals striking similarity. The eaeIM gene also encodes alpha and beta polypeptides of 309 and 176 amino acids which share 96% and 97% identity, respectively, with those of ecoHK31IM. ecoHK31IR and eaeIR encode proteins of 318 and 315 aa, respectively, which share 92% identity but are otherwise unique in the GenBank database. The EaeI and the EcoHK31I R-M systems were found to be flanked by genes coding for integrases. It is possible that these integrases have facilitated the transfer of this system among different bacterial species.
TI  - Tungiasis among five communities in south-western Trinidad, West Indies.
AB  - The prevalences of Tunga penetrans Linn. within the five townships of Granville,  Fullerton, Icacos, Coromandel and Cedros in south-western Trinidad, West Indies, as determined by physical examination of all inhabitants present during the survey, were 17.0% (38/223 subjects), 15.7% (36/237), 31.4% (102/325), 17.4% (42/242) and 17.9% (50/280), respectively. The rate in Icacos was significantly higher than in the other four sites (P < 0.001). Not only were males more likely to be infected than females in all five study sites (P < 0.0007) but chigoe-flea burdens were also higher in males than in females (P < 0.012), with mean (S.D.) burdens of 5.44 (2.54) fleas/male infected subject and 2.38 (2.00) fleas/female infected subject. Feet were significantly more infected than other areas of the body (P < 0.001). Analysis of variance revealed that the interactions between prevalence of chigoe-flea infection and geographical location (P = 0.0058) and between sex of infected subject and site of infection (P = 0.0109) were highly significant but that between geographical location and sex of infected subject was not significant (P > 0.30). At least seven species of bacteria, with varying sensitivities to antibiotics, were isolated from 16 patients with sepsis associated with their T. penetrans infections: Streptococcus pyogenes, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (not group A), Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and a Bacillus species. Closteridium tetani was not isolated.
TI  - Coliforms and Salmonella in seawater near to domestic sewage sources in Fortaleza (Ceara, Brazil).
AB  - The bacteriological conditions of the coastal region of Fortaleza (Ceara, Brasil), including the coastal zones of the Ceara and Coco rivers, were examined. The study was conducted during June, September and December 1993, and March 1994. The region was divided into two areas: (i) Direct Influence Area (DIA), consisting of 20 sampling stations located near to discharge zones of the submarine pipeline system, where collections were carried out at the surface, and (ii) Indirect Influence Area (IIA), located near to the coastal zone, including Barra do Ceara, Kartodromo, Volta de Jurema, Mucuripe, Farol and Caca e Pesca beaches, totalling 26 sampling stations. The most probable number (MPN) of both total and fecal coliforms in DIA was positive only in station number 6, near to the sewage discharge exit. The following bacteria were identified: Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Kartodromo beach was contaminated throughout the sampling period. Results of total fecal MPN was essentially lower than 3.0 x 10(2) coliforms/100 ml at Caca e Pesca beach. In December, at both DIA and IIA, Salmonella was identified in several samples. In DIA, the spatial distribution for Salmonella suggests that there should be a coastal sea current from east to west along the coastline. In IIA, Salmonella was identified at Kartodromo and Farol beaches throughout the sampling period.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 Gram-negative and 498 Gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. The activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. Trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, group G streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. The reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. The commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. There was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing Enterobacter agglomerans and E. cloacae, where the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher MIC90 value.
TI  - Chromosomally encoded ampC-type beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A clinical strain of Proteus mirabilis (CF09) isolated from urine specimens of a  patient displayed resistance to amoxicillin (MIC >4,096 microg/ml), ticarcillin (4,096 microg/ml), cefoxitin (64 microg/ml), cefotaxime (256 microg/ml), and ceftazidime (128 microg/ml) and required an elevated MIC of aztreonam (4 microg/ml). Clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins. Two beta-lactamases with apparent pIs of 5.6 and 9.0 were identified by isoelectric focusing on a gel. Substrate and inhibition profiles were characteristic of an AmpC-type beta-lactamase with a pI of 9.0. Amplification by PCR with primers for ampC genes (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii) of a 756-bp DNA fragment from strain CF09 was obtained only with C. freundii-specific primers. Hybridization results showed that the ampC gene is only chromosomally located while the TEM gene is plasmid located. After cloning of the gene, analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence (1,146 bp) showed that this ampC gene is close to blaCMY-2, from which it differs by three point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions Glu --> Gly at position 22, Trp --> Arg at position 201, and Ser --> Asn at position 343. AmpC beta-lactamases derived from that of C. freundii (LAT-1, LAT-2, BIL-1, and CMY-2) have been found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, and Enterobacter aerogenes and have been reported to be plasmid borne. This is the first example of a chromosomally encoded AmpC-type beta-lactamase observed in P. mirabilis. We suggest that it be designated CMY-3.
TI  - A mixed culture recovery method indicates that enteric bacteria do not enter the  viable but nonculturable state.
AB  - A new method, called the mixed culture recovery (MCR) method, has been developed  to determine whether recovery of culturable bacterial cells from a population of largely nonculturable cells is due to resuscitation of the nonculturable cells from a viable but nonculturable state or simply to growth of residual culturable cells. The MCR method addresses this issue in that it involves the mixing of two easily distinguishable strains (e.g., lactose positive and negative) in such a way that large numbers of nonculturable cells of both strains are present together with a small number of culturable cells of only one strain, performing a nutrient addition resuscitation procedure, and then plating the cells to determine whether both cell types are recoverable. In repeated experiments with strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Salmonella choleraesuis, only cells of the culturable strain were recovered after application of various resuscitation techniques. These results suggest that the nonculturable cells were dead and that the apparent resuscitation was merely due to the growth of the remaining culturable cells.
TI  - Phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella based on DNA sequence comparison of atpD encoding the beta subunit of ATP synthase.
AB  - DNA sequences covering 57% of atpD encoding the beta subunit of ATP synthase were determined for 16 strains of Salmonella enterica, two strains of S. bongori, and one strain each of Citrobacter freundii and Yersinia enterocolitica, and comparison was made with the published Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes sequences. The phylogenetic tree based on maximum-likelihood analysis showed separation of the subspecies of S. enterica except for two serotypes of subspecies II which were unsupported by a common node. The two serotypes of S. bongori were separated from S. enterica and related to the serotypes of subspecies II. A tight relationship was found between S. enterica subspecies IIIa consisting of monophasic serotypes and subspecies IIIb consisting of diphasic serotypes. This is in conflict with results obtained for most other housekeeping genes and the 23S rRNA gene separating mono- from diphasic subspecies.
TI  - Amino acid decarboxylase capability of microorganisms isolated in Spanish fermented meat products.
AB  - Enterobacteria, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Gram-positive cocci were isolated  from Spanish meat products. The most frequent species in the meat products studied were identified as Lactobacillus sake, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus curvatus from De Man-Rogosa-Sharpe agar; Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Micrococcus varians from mannitol salt phenol-red agar; and Hafnia alvei, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter amnigenes and Enterobacter aerogenes from violet red bile dextrose agar. The amino acid decarboxylase activity of the microorganisms isolated was assayed. Enterobacteria had higher amino acid decarboxylase activity than the other groups. LAB did not show any significant amino acid decarboxylase capability in this study.
TI  - Occurrence of homologs of the Escherichia coli lytB gene in gram-negative bacterial species.
AB  - The Escherichia coli LytB protein regulates the activity of guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate synthetase I (RelA). A Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA with the E. coli lytB gene as a probe revealed the presence of lytB homologs in all of the gram-negative bacterial species examined but not in gram-positive species. The lytB homologs from Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas fluorescens complemented the E. coli lytB44 mutant allele.
TI  - [Occurrence and susceptibility of hospital strains producing enzymes with a wide  spectrum of substrate profiles].
AB  - In connection with more and more frequent occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases an effort has been made to detect their presence in the biological materials coming from the patients of different wards of Mining Hospital in Sosnowiec from January to September 1995. Among 38 diagnostic materials, from which the strains in question were isolated, the following materials have been examined: bronchial lavage (52.6%), surgical wounds (18.4%), urines (15.8%) and others (13.2%). The examined diagnostic materials came from Intensive Care Unit (87.0%), Casualty and Orthopaedic Surgery Clinic (5.0%) and General Surgery Clinic (3.0%). The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae. (47.4%), Serratia marcescens (36.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (10.5%) and others (5.3%). Half of the examined strains constituted those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases and probably possessing an extra resistance mechanism: (Serratia marcescens--74%, Enterobacter cloacae--21%, Enterobacter aerogenes--5.0%) and 50% were those producing extended--spectrum beta-lactamases. (Klebsiella pneumoniae--95%, Escherichia coli--5%). Susceptibility of the examined strains to anti-microbial antibiotics was diverse. Full susceptibility of the analysed strains has been observed exclusively in case of Karbapenems (Imipenem, Meropenem and Cefamycyn). In case of beta-lactamase with beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations susceptibility was diverse and dependent on the species of the examined microorganism.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins among Enterobacter aerogenes strains.
AB  - Resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins commonly develops in Enterobacter  aerogenes during therapy due to selection of mutants producing high levels of the chromosomal Bush group 1 beta-lactamase. Recently, resistant strains producing plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have been isolated as well. A study was designed to investigate ESBL production among 31 clinical isolates of E. aerogenes from Richmond, Va., with decreased susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and a positive double-disk potentiation test. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion and agar dilution procedures. Beta-lactamases were investigated by an isoelectric focusing overlay technique which simultaneously determined isoelectric points (pIs) and substrate or inhibitor profiles. Decreased susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam (MIC range, 1 to 64 microg/ml) was detected and associated with resistance to gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All strains produced an inducible Bush group 1 beta-lactamase (pI 83). Twenty-nine of the 31 isolates also produced an enzyme similar to SHV-4 (pI 7.8), while 1 isolate each produced an enzyme similar to SHV-3 (pI 6.9) and to SHV-5 (pI 8.2). The three different SHV-derived ESBLs were transferred by transconjugation to Escherichia coli C600N and amplified by PCR. Plasmid profiles of the clinical isolates showed a variety of different large plasmids. Because of the linkage of resistance to aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with ESBL production, it is possible that the usage of these drugs was responsible for selecting plasmid-mediated resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in E. aerogenes. Furthermore, it is important that strains such as these be recognized, because they can be responsible for institutional spread of resistance genes.
TI  - Clinical disorders in armadillos (Dasypodidae, Edentata) in captivity.
AB  - The major health problems found in 113 armadillos are presented and correlated with management in captivity. The most common of 217 recorded clinical disorders involved injury (28.5%), digestive system (17.9%), respiratory system (15.2%), nutritional deficiency (13.3%), skin problems (3.6%), septicaemia (1.8%), nervous system (1.3%), urinary system (0.9%) and effects of environmental (0.9%), with 14.7% of the cases inconclusive. Internal parasites were identified in 42.0% of faeces samples, mainly eggs of helminths (66.6%), of which the commonest were Ancylostoma sp. (33.3%), Strongyloides sp. (30.5%), Ascaris sp. (25.0%), Trichuris sp. (11.1%), and also protozoa (13.0%). Enterobacteriaceae were the bacteria most frequently isolated, with Escherichia coli the most prevalent, followed by Salmonella sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes. The most successful treatments are listed. The influence of some captive factors on the onset of the diseases was also analysed: donated animals 91.1% and zoo born 8.8%; quarantine enclosure 84.0% and exhibition 15.0%; and related to time in captivity, 92.2% occurred with animals in the first 6 months in the zoo and 7.8% with animals more than 6 months.
TI  - Reductive and hydrolytic activities of enteric bacteria on food colours.
AB  - Reductive and hydrolytic activities on two food colours namely metanil yellow and indigo carmine by different strains of enteric bacteria were evaluated. Enteric bacteria possessed both reductive and hydrolytic capabilities which depended upon the incubation period and the type of strain. In certain bacterial strains, (Escherichia coli and Vibrio sp.), reductive activity was visible after 3 hr. Other enteric strains showed an increasing activity right from the beginning of incubation. Enterobacter cloacae appeared to be producing maximum reductive capability followed by Enterobacter aerogenes and E. coli. Even enteric bacterial strains demonstrated a good response in obtaining hydrolytic activity of indigo carmine during incubation upto 10 hr, establishing the fact that the gut microflora may cause health problem to consumers.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of an outbreak due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria in a French hospital.
AB  - Between June 1992 and June 1993, 128 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria (123 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, and 1 Citrobacter diversus) were collected in a French university hospital. These isolates were recovered mainly from patients hospitalized in intensive care and neurosurgery units. The 128 strains were divided into 14 antibiotypes (ATBs; ATB1 to ATB14); 102 of 103 nonredundant isolates were shown to produce an SHV-4-related extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (pl 7.8, hybridization with a blaSHV probe); the remaining strain (Kp 2108) produced a TEM-3-related extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (pl 6.3, hybridization with a blaTEM probe). For representative isolates, five plasmid profiles (Pl to Pll-4), eight ribotypes (E1 to E8), and seven arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction profiles (A1 to A7) were obtained. The results suggest the spread of an epidemic strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (E1, A1, Pl, various ATBs) from an intensive care unit throughout the hospital. Another epidemic strain (E2, A2, pl, ATB4) was confined to the neurosurgery unit. Other extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae of ribotypes distinct from E1 or E2 might result from the spread of an epidemic plasmid, such as reported for isolates of other enterobacterial species. Conversely, they might represent imported cases, such as the strain Kp 2108, which produced a TEM-3-related beta-lactamase.
TI  - Characteristics of the melibiose transporter and its primary structure in Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - Cells of Enterobacter aerogenes can grow on melibiose as a sole source of carbon. This suggests the presence of melibiose operon in this organism. We found that E. aerogenes cells possess both alpha-galactosidase activity and melibiose transport activity, which were induced by melibiose. Neither Na+ nor Li+ stimulated the melibiose transport. However, transport of methyl-beta-thiogalactoside (TMG) was stimulated by Li+ but not by Na+. These findings suggest that the major coupling cation for the melibiose transporter in E. aerogenes is H+. In fact, we observed H+ entry into cells caused by an influx of melibiose and some of its analogs. We cloned the melB gene which encodes the melibiose transporter, and sequenced it. Deduced amino acid sequence of the transporter revealed that the melibiose transporter consists of 471 amino acid residues and the molecular weight was calculated to be 52214 Da. The sequence showed high homology with the sequences of the melibiose transporters of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Higher homology was found with the melibiose transporter of K. pneumoniae than with that of E. coli and S. typhimurium.
TI  - [Study of in vitro activity of 3 cephalosporins and their combination with 2 beta-lactamase inhibitors against 4 enterobacteria strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of cefotaxime, cefepime and cefpirome was evaluated alone and in association with two beta-lactamase inhibitors: clavulanic acid and sulbactam against 65 extended broad spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae strains [Klebsiella pneumoniae (35), Proteus mirabilis (9), Escherichia coli (11), Enterobacter aerogenes (10)]. The lowest MICs were observed for cefepime and cefpirome used alone. In association with inhibitors cefotaxime was less effective against E. aerogenes. Most isolates of K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, E. coli were susceptible to all the different tested associations.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of BMS-180680, a new catechol-containing monobactam.
AB  - The in vitro activities of a new catechol-containing monobactam, BMS-180680 (SQ 84,100), were compared to those of aztreonam, ceftazidime, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. BMS-180680 was often the most active compound against many species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90s) of < or = 0.5 microg/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus spp., and Providencia spp. BMS-180680 had moderate activities (MIC90s of 2 to 8 microg/ml) against Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Shigella spp., and non-E. aerogenes Enterobacter spp. BMS-180680 was the only antibiotic evaluated that was active against >90% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.25 microg/ml), Burkholderia cepacia, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90s, 1 microg/ml) strains tested. BMS-180680 was inactive against most strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas diminuta, and Burkholderia pickettii. BMS-180680 was moderately active (MIC90s of 4 to 8 microg/ml) against Alcaligenes spp. and Acinetobacter lwoffii and less active (MIC90, 16 microg/ml) against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumanii complex. BMS-180680 lacked activity against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. Both tonB and cir fiu double mutants of E. coli had greatly decreased susceptibility to BMS-180680. Of the TEM, PSE, and chromosomal-encoded beta-lactamases tested, only the K1 enzyme hydrolyzed BMS-180680 to any measurable extent. Like aztreonam, BMS-180680 bound preferentially to penicillin-binding protein 3. The MICs of BMS-180680 were not influenced by the presence of hematin or 5% sheep blood in the test medium or with incubation in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. BMS-180680 MICs obtained under strict anaerobic conditions were significantly higher than those obtained in ambient air.
TI  - Comparison of axenic and monoxenic media for isolation of Acanthamoeba.
AB  - Acanthamoeba is a genus of ubiquitous, free-living amebae that can be difficult to isolate by standard microbiologic techniques. We retrospectively reviewed the laboratory records of patients with ocular acanthamoebic infection for the period from January 1973 to June 1996 and found that Acanthamoeba isolates were recovered from 73, 71, and 70% of clinical specimens inoculated onto buffered charcoal-yeast extract agar (BCYE), nonnutrient agar with live or dead Escherichia coli, and tryptic soy agar (TSA) with horse or sheep blood, respectively. We then prospectively compared the recovery of a corneal isolate of Acanthamoeba on commercial media from Remel and BBL (TSA with 5% sheep blood, TSA with 5% horse blood, TSA with 5% rabbit blood, V agar, chocolate agar, BCYE, and selective BCYE with polymyxin B, anisomycin, and vancomycin) and on axenic and monoxenic media prepared with live or dead bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). Good recovery of trophozoites was obtained on BCYE, TSA with rabbit blood, TSA with horse blood, and Remel TSA with sheep blood. BBL TSA with horse blood or rabbit blood provided good recovery of cysts. All species of live or dead bacteria yielded good recovery of trophozoites; however, only nonnutrient agar with live P. aeruginosa, live E. aerogenes, or live S. maltophilia gave good recovery of cysts. TSA with either rabbit blood or horse blood, BCYE, and nonnutrient agar prepared with live P. aeruginosa, E. aerogenes, or S. maltophilia offer optimal recovery of Acanthamoeba.
TI  - The nucleoside-specific Tsx channel from the outer membrane of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes: functional characterization and DNA sequence analysis of the tsx genes.
AB  - The Escherichia coli tsx gene encodes an integral outer-membrane protein (Tsx) that functions as a substrate-specific channel for deoxynucleosides and the antibiotic albicidin, and also serves as a receptor for bacteriophages and colicins. We cloned the structural genes of the Tsx proteins from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes and expressed them in an E.coli tsx mutant. The heterologous Tsx proteins fully substituted the E.coli Tsx protein with respect to its function in deoxynucleoside and albicidin uptake, and as receptor for colicin K. The Tsx proteins from K. pneumoniae and Ent. aerogenes were also proficient as receptors for several Tsx-specific bacteriophages, whereas the corresponding protein from S. typhimurium did not confer sensitivity against these phages. The nucleotide sequence of the tsx genes from S. typhimurium, K. pneumoniae and Ent. aerogenes was established. Each of the Tsx proteins is initially synthesized with typical bacterial signal sequence peptides and the predicted mature forms of the Tsx proteins have a calculated M(r) of 30,567 (265 residues), 31,412 (272 residues) and 31,477 (272 residues), respectively. Multiple sequence alignments between the Tsx proteins showed a high degree of sequence identity and revealed the presence of four hypervariable regions, which are thought to constitute segments of the polypeptide chain exposed at the cell surface. Most notable was a deletion of 8 amino acids in one of these hypervariable domains in the S. typhimurium Tsx protein. When this deletion was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the corresponding region of the E.coli tsx gene, the mutant Tsx-515 protein lost its phage receptor function but still served as a colicin K receptor and as a substrate-specific channel, indicating that the region between residues 198 and 207 might be part of the bacteriophage receptor area. Multiple sequence alignments, structural predictions and the properties of previously characterized Tsx missense mutants were taken into account to develop a two-dimensional model for the topological organization of the Tsx protein within the outer membrane.
TI  - A simulation of microbial competition in the human colonic ecosystem.
AB  - Many investigations of the interactions of microbial competitors in the gastrointestinal tract used continuous-flow anaerobic cultures. The simulation reported here was a deterministic 11-compartment model coded by using the C programming language and based on parameters from published in vitro studies and assumptions were data were unavailable. The resource compartments were glucose, lactose and sucrose, starch, sorbose, and serine. Six microbial competitors included indigenous nonpathogenic colonizers of the human gastrointestinal tract (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroids ovatus, Fusobacterium varium, and Enterococcus faecalis) and the potential human enteropathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Flows of carbon from the resources to the microbes were modified by resource and space controls. Partitioning of resources to the competitors that could utilize them was calculated at each iteration on the basis of availability of all resources by feeding preference functions. Resources did not accumulate during iterations of the model. The results of the computer simulation of microbial competition model and for various modifications of the model. The results were based on few measured parameters but may be useful in the design of user-friendly software to aid researchers in defining and manipulating the microbial ecology of colonic ecosystems as relates to food-borne disease.
TI  - Survey of prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - During the first six months of 1990 and 1994 respectively, 3179 and 2721 non-repetitive strains of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated at the teaching hospital of Clermont-Ferrand. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were found in 147 isolates, mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 37) and Proteus mirabilis (n = 15). TEM-3/CTX-1, SHV-4/CAZ-5 and TEM-24/CAZ-6 were the prevalent enzymes. However, the most frequently involved enzyme in 1990 was TEM-3 (48.6%) whereas in 1994 it was SHV-4 (56.0%). Two salient features emerged from this study: the high frequency of TEM-3 production in P. mirabilis and the production of SHV-4 enzyme, heretofore observed solely in K. pneumoniae, in two other species, E. aerogenes and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Transferable cefoxitin resistance in enterobacteria from Greek hospitals and characterization of a plasmid-mediated group 1 beta-lactamase (LAT-2).
AB  - Cefoxitin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae from Escherichia coli strains isolated in Greek hospitals was found to be due to the acquisition of similar plasmids coding for group 1 beta-lactamases. The plasmids were not self-transferable but were mobilized by conjugative plasmids. These elements have also been spread to Enterobacter aerogenes. The most common enzyme was a Citrobacter freundii-derived cephalosporinase (LAT-2) which differed from LAT-1 by three amino acids.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against pathogens associated with community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias.
AB  - The serum bactericidal activities of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against organisms commonly implicated in community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias were studied. Ceftizoxime 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 12 hours for two doses and ceftriaxone 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 24 hours for two doses were administered to 20 healthy volunteers in a crossover fashion. Blood samples were drawn immediately before and 2,4,6,8,10, and 12 hours after the second ceftizoxime dose and immediately before and 8,12,16,18,20, and 24 hours after the second ceftriaxone dose. Serum drug concentrations were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography. Serum bactericidal titers were determined in duplicate for each serum sample against four clinical isolates of each of the following organisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. The median duration of serum bactericidal activity during the dosage interval was significantly different between antimicrobial regimens only for S. pneumoniae (92% of the dosage interval for ceftizoxime, versus 100% for ceftriaxone). This difference does not appear to be clinically important since ceftizoxime provides adequate serum bactericidal activity for more than 50% of the dosage interval and its effectiveness against pneumococcal pneumonia has been supported in clinical trials. The ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime regimens did not differ significantly in their duration of serum bactericidal activity against six of the seven organisms tested.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (UP-PCR) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. A universal protocol of preparation of PCR samples from cultures representing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. The bands of UP-PCR products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. The applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the DNA bands obtained for different strains. Three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis produced very similar DNA banding patterns. They comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. The DNA profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. The method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.
TI  - Inactivation of glutaraldehyde by reaction with sodium bisulfite.
AB  - The microbiocidal activity of glutaraldehyde was inactivated by reaction with sodium bisulfite via formation of a proposed glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of 2% (0.2M) alkaline glutaraldehyde indicated complete loss of glutaraldehyde at a 2.2:1 molar ratio of sodium bisulfite to glutaraldehyde. Neither 1.7% (0.17 M) sodium bisulfite alone nor the glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex was microbiocidal when tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Polybac Polyseed BOD seed inoculum. Bacterial inhibition tests indicated that the glutaraldehyde-sodium bisulfite complex had no effect on the growth of sewage microorganisms at concentrations as high as 50-100 ppm (5 x 10(-4)-1 x 10(-3) M), with an IC50 of 230-440 ppm (2.3 x 10(-3)-4.4 x 10(-3) M), based on glutaraldehyde concentration. A 28-close bottle test showed a 5-d biodegradation of 48% and 51%, and a 15-d biodegradation of 57% and 63% for 3:1 and 2.2:1 bisulfite to glutaraldehyde molar ratios, respectively. Acute aquatic toxicity testing with Daphnia magna demonstrated an LC50 of 41-109 ppm (4.1 x 10(-4)-10.9 x 10(-4) M) and a no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) of 16 ppm (1.6 x 10(-4) M) for the proposed glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex (based on glutaraldehyde concentration), approximately 10-fold higher than found for glutaraldehyde alone, indicating that the proposed glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex is less toxic to the environment than glutaraldehyde.
TI  - Incidence and susceptibility of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli from 20 Canadian intensive care units: 1989-1993.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Canadian intensive care units. DESIGN: The antimicrobial profiles of 1939 Gram-negative bacilli isolated in 20 Canadian intensive care units were analyzed using a custom designed MicroScan panel. SETTING: The majority of the hospitals were tertiary care institutions, but some community hospitals were included. PATIENTS: Adult intensive care unit patients were the sources of isolates. MAIN RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated microorganism overall, with Escherichia coli the most common initial isolate. Comparison of initial and repeat isolates showed that P aeruginosa readily acquired resistance to all antibiotic classes except the aminoglycosides. Enterobacter aerogenes developed resistance to ciprofloxacin and Enterobacter cloacae demonstrated resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics except for imipenem on repeat isolation. Other Enterobacteriaceae remained susceptible. Historical comparison with data derived four years previously from 15 of the centres showed increased resistance of P aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species to ciprofloxacin while other susceptibility patterns remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Gram-negative resistance in Canadian hospitals is less than that reported in surveys done in some other countries, and was relatively stable over four years.
TI  - Outbreak of TEM-24-producing Enterobacter aerogenes in an intensive care unit and dissemination of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase to other members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - We report an outbreak of Enterobacter aerogenes in an intensive care unit (ICU) and two medicine departments that produced the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24, which was difficult to detect by disk agar diffusion. The strains were compared by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism after pulsed-field gel electrophoresis following cleavage with XbaI. This typing method indicated that a single strain, first isolated in the ICU, spread throughout the other medical departments as a result of patient transfer. We also observed the transfer in vivo of the plasmid encoding TEM-24 from the strain of Enterobacter aerogenes to different strains of Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii in the ICU. It therefore appears that the epidemic involved results from two events: dissemination of one strain of Enterobacter aerogenes and dissemination of the plasmid encoding TEM-24 among various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Evidence suggesting cis action by the TnaC leader peptide in regulating transcription attenuation in the tryptophanase operon of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Expression of the tryptophanase (tna) operon in Escherichia coli is regulated by  catabolite repression and transcription attenuation. Elevated levels of tryptophan induce transcription antitermination at one or more Rho factor-dependent termination sites in the leader region of the operon. Induction requires translation of a 24-residue coding region, tnaC, located in the 319-nucleotide transcribed leader region preceding tnaA, the structural gene for tryptophanase. In the present paper, we show that two bacterial species that lack tryptophanase activity, Enterobacter aerogenes and Salmonella typhimurium, allow tryptophanase induction and tna operon regulation when they carry a plasmid containing the E. coli tna operon. The role of tnaC in induction was examined by introducing mutations in a 24-nucleotide segment of tnaC of E. coli surrounding and including the crucial Trp codon 12. Some mutations resulted in a noninducible phenotype; these mostly introduced nonconservative amino acid substitutions in TnaC. Other mutations had little or no effect; these generally were in third positions of codons or introduced conservative amino acid replacements. A tryptophan-inserting, UGA-reading glutamine suppressor tRNA was observed to restore partial regulation when Trp codon 12 of tnaC was changed to UGA. Stop codons introduced downstream of Trp codon 12 in all three reading frames established that induction requires translation in the natural tnaC reading frame. Our findings suggest that the TnaC leader peptide acts in cis to prevent Rho-dependent termination.
TI  - A system to generate chromosomal mutations in Lactococcus lactis which allows fast analysis of targeted genes.
AB  - A system for generating chromosomal insertions in lactococci is described. It is  based on the conditional replication of lactococcal pWV01-derived Ori+ RepA- vector pORI19, containing lacZ alpha and the multiple cloning site of pUC19. Chromosomal AluI fragments of Lactococcus lactis were cloned in pORI19 in RepA+ helper strain Escherichia coli EC101. The frequency of Campbell-type recombinants, following introduction of this plasmid bank into L. lactis (RepA-), was increased by combining the system with temperature-sensitive pWV01 derivative pVE6007. Transformation of L. lactis MG1363 (pVE6007) with the pORI19 bank of lactococcal chromosomal fragments at the permissive temperature allowed replication of several copies of a recombinant plasmid from the bank within a cell because of the provision in trans of RepA-Ts from pVE6007. A temperature shift to 37 degrees C resulted in loss of pVE6007 and integration of the pORI19 derivatives at high frequencies. A bank of lactococcal mutants was made in this way and successfully screened for the presence of two mutations: one in the monocistronic 1.3-kb peptidoglycan hydrolase gene (acmA) and one in the hitherto uncharacterized maltose fermentation pathway. Reintroduction of pVE6007 into the Mal- mutant at 30 degrees C resulted in excision of the integrated plasmid and restoration of the ability of ferment maltose. The integration plasmid (pMAL) was rescued by using the isolated plasmid content of a restored Mal+ colony to transform E. coli EC101. Nucleotide sequencing of the 564-bp chromosomal fragment in pMAL revealed an internal part of an open reading frame of which the translated product showed significant homology with ATP-binding proteins MalK of E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Enterobacter aerogenes and MsmK of Streptococcus mutans. This combined use of two types of conditional replicating pWV01-derived vectors represents a novel, powerful tool for chromosomal gene inactivation, targeting, cloning, and sequencing of the labelled gene.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpirome against selected clinical enterobacterial isolates with beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that there is a high incidence of resistance to cephalosporins among enterobacteria isolated in Greek hospitals. This resistance is mainly due to either the derepression of chromosomal cephalosporinases or the acquisition of plasmids coding for SHV-5 type beta-lactamase. In the present study the activity of cefpirome against a number of enterobacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia marcescens) possessing the mechanisms mentioned above was examined. Cefpirome was found active against all the strains characterized by stable derepression of chromosomal class-C enzymes. The antibiotic was less potent against strains expressing SHV-5 type beta-lactamase due to its hydrolysis by the enzyme. Also cefpirome exhibited good activity against E. aerogenes strains with reduced susceptibility to imipenem. These in vitro data suggest that cefpirome might be useful in treating infections caused by these resistant microorganisms that are frequently encountered in Greek hospitals.
TI  - Molecular cloning, mapping, and regulation of Pho regulon genes for phosphonate breakdown by the phosphonatase pathway of Salmonella typhimurium LT2.
AB  - Two pathways exist for cleavage of the carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bond of phosphonates, the C-P lyase and the phosphonatase pathways. It was previously demonstrated that Escherichia coli carries genes (named phn) only for the C-P lyase pathway and that Enterobacter aerogenes carries genes for both pathways (K.-S. Lee, W. W. Metcalf, and B. L. Wanner, J. Bacteriol. 174:2501-2510, 1992). In contrast, here it is shown that Salmonella typhimurium LT2 carries genes only for the phosphonatase pathway. Genes for the S. typhimurium phosphonatase pathway were cloned by complementation of E. coli delta phn mutants. Genes for these pathways were proven not to be homologous and to lie in different chromosomal regions. The S. typhimurium phn locus lies near 10 min; the E. coli phn locus lies near 93 min. The S. typhimurium phn gene cluster is about 7.2 kb in length and, on the basis of gene fusion analysis, appears to consist of two (or more) genes or operons that are divergently transcribed. Like that of the E. coli phn locus, the expression of the S. typhimurium phn locus is activated under conditions of Pi limitation and is subject to Pho regulon control. This was shown both by complementation of the appropriate E. coli mutants and by the construction of S. typhimurium mutants with lesions in the phoB and pst loci, which are required for activation and inhibition of Pho regulon gene expression, respectively. Complementation studies indicate that the S. typhimurium phn locus probably includes genes both for phosphonate transport and for catalysis of C-P bond cleavage.
TI  - Membrane hyperpolarisation by valinomycin and its limitations for bacterial viability assessment using rhodamine 123 and flow cytometry.
AB  - The ionophore, valinomycin, was investigated as a possible means of bacterial viability assessment using the fluorescent membrane potential dye rhodamine 123. Membrane hyperpolarisation in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter aerogenes and Arthrobacter globiformis was examined during exponential growth and during stress by brief starvation in a high sodium, low potassium buffer using flow cytometric analysis of rhodamine 123 uptake. Dye uptake was variable both between species and amongst cells from the same culture. Exponential phase cells showed no increase in dye uptake due to valinomycin treatment. Stressed P. fluorescens cells responded to valinomycin treatment by increased dye uptake, while stressed E. coli and A. globiformis cells showed no response. Approximately 50% of stressed Eb. aerogenes cells responded to valinomycin. The results demonstrate the limitations of rhodamine dye for viability analysing the viability of diverse bacterial communities and underline the degree of cell heterogeneity in batch cultures.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Decreased transmission of Enterobacteriaceae with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an intensive care unit by nursing reorganization.
AB  - In our gastrointestinal surgical intensive care unit (SICU), the large number of  patients with multiple enterostomies enhances the risk of nosocomial transmission of gut extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLE) by health care workers. A control study performed in our SICU from June-August 1992 showed an ESBLE gut colonization rate of 70%. To reduce this rate, nursing procedures were intensified or modified, particularly handwashing, single-use equipment and waste control. To test the efficiency of these procedures, 64 patients hospitalized for more than two days from September 1992-March 1993 were screened for gut acquisition of ESBLE. Rectal samples were taken within 48 h after admission and then weekly. After nursing reorganization, the ESBLE colonization rate dropped significantly to 40% (P < 0.001). Twenty patients (31.7%) acquired a gut ESBLE, after a mean of 24.3 +/- 13.7 days. Each patient was colonized with one, two or three ESBLE (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes). Baseline characteristics of the 20 colonized and 39 non-colonized patients showed no significant difference (Student's t-test, P > 0.05). The nursing workload, estimated as a omega index, was greater in the colonized group (P < 0.001). These findings show that strict observance of nursing procedures can significantly reduce ESBLE acquisition in a high-risk surgical unit.
TI  - Enzymatic synthesis of L-tryptophan by Enterobacter aerogenes tryptophanase highly expressed in Escherichia coli, and some properties of the purified enzyme.
AB  - We constructed two plasmids that have a strong tac promoter and a structural gene for tryptophanase of Enterobacter aerogenes SM-18 (pKT901EA) or Escherichia coli K-12 (pKT951EC). The tryptophanase activity of E. coli JM109 transformed with pKT901EA (JM109/pKT901EA) was inducible with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and 3.6 times higher than that of E. aerogenes SM-18. Cells of JM109/pKT901EA induced for tryptophanase synthesized L-tryptophan from indole, ammonia, and pyruvate more efficiently than E. aerogenes SM-18. Although JM109/pKT951EC expressed a similar level of tryptophanase activity to that of JM109/pKT901EA, the synthesis of L-tryptophan by the cells of JM109/pKT951EC did not proceed well compared with JM109/pKT901EA. Tryptophanases from E. aerogenes and E. coli K-12 were purified, and their properties were investigated. The purified E. aerogenes tryptophanase showed higher stability against heat inactivation than E. coli tryptophanase.
TI  - Identification of a global repressor gene, rsmA, of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora that controls extracellular enzymes, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, and pathogenicity in soft-rotting Erwinia spp.
AB  - The production of extracellular enzymes such as pectate lyase (Pel), polygalacturonase (Peh), cellulase (Cel), and protease (Prt) is activated by the cell density (quorum)-sensing signal, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (HSL); plant signals; and aep genes during postexponential growth of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora 71. Studies with mutants of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71 derepressed in exoenzyme production led to the identification of a negative regulator gene, rsmA (rsm, repressor of secondary metabolites). Nucleotide sequencing, transcript assays, and protein analysis established that a 183-bp open reading frame encodes the 6.8-kDa RsmA. rsmA has extensive homology with the csrA gene of Escherichia coli, which specifies a negative regulator of carbon storage. Moreover, the suppression of glycogen synthesis in E. coli by rsmA indicates that the Erwinia gene is functionally similar to csrA. Southern hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmA homologs in soft-rotting and non-soft-rotting Erwinia spp. and in other enterobacteria such as Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. rsmA suppresses production of Pel, Peh, Cel, and Prt, plant pathogenicity, and synthesis of HSL in E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, and E. chrysanthemi. In the E. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71, rsmA reduces the levels of transcripts of hslI, a luxI homolog required for HSL biosynthesis. This specific effect and the previous finding that HSL is required for extracellular enzyme production and pathogenicity in soft-rotting Erwinia spp. support the hypothesis that rsmA controls these traits by modulating the levels of the cell density (quorum)-sensing signal.
TI  - Control of infection with multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria in a hospital renal unit: the value of plasmid characterization.
AB  - An outbreak of infections due to multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria took place over a period of approximately 18 months in a renal unit. Strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. were involved, and a variety of antibiotic resistances was encountered. Closely related plasmids encoding resistance to aztreonam, ceftazidime and piperacillin, possibly derived from an archetypal plasmid of 105 kb were found in the majority of isolates examined. After limiting the use of aztreonam the incidence of new patient isolates of multiple-resistant organisms was greatly reduced. This study demonstrated how molecular studies can contribute to the control of an outbreak situation in a hospital unit by providing an impetus to reduce the use of specific antibiotics.
TI  - Decrease in culturability of Vibrio cholerae caused by glucose.
AB  - The culturability of Vibrio cholerae O1 serotype Inaba strain 569B was decreased  by the addition of glucose to cell suspensions in starvation media. A similar effect was observed with sucrose, maltose, and fructose. We term this inhibitory effect glucose shock. It was not observed with arabinose or xylose or with carboxylates, such as acetate and pyruvate. No acidification of the medium occurred in the presence of these carbohydrates. Glucose shock was prevented by the addition of nitrogen or phosphorus sources. In the presence of phosphate, the bacterium produced formic acid from glucose. The phenomenon of glucose shock was also observed in V. cholerae O1 serotype Inaba strain RIMD 2203082 but not in strain RIMD 2203088 (O1 Inaba), IID 936 (O1 Ogawa), or RIMD 2214034 (non-O1). The culturability of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Listonella anguillarum did not decrease in starvation media with added glucose. Hence, the phenomenon should have ecological significance in determining the distribution of bacteria in marine ecosystems in situations where carbohydrates are abundant, but nitrogen and phosphorus are limiting.
TI  - Ceftibuten: a review of antimicrobial activity, spectrum and other microbiologic  features.
AB  - Ceftibuten is a new, orally administered cephalosporin with exceptional beta-lactamase stability and potency against commonly isolated Gram-negative pathogens. More than 90% of recent Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were inhibited by < or = 8 micrograms/ml of ceftibuten. In only five enteric species (Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens) were more than 15% of strains resistant (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC, with percent of strains inhibited in subscript numbers) > 16 micrograms/ml) to ceftibuten. Enteritis-producing bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli and Yersinia were very ceftibuten-susceptible (MIC50 < or = 0.13 microgram/ml). Fastidious Gram-negative species causing respiratory tract or genital infections had very low ceftibuten MICs, including beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 to 2 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml). Beta-hemolytic streptococci and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci were also inhibited by ceftibuten. Staphylococci, enterococci, Pseudomonas species and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were generally resistant to ceftibuten. Ceftibuten has demonstrated bactericidal activity against susceptible pathogens, has high affinity for several lethal penicillin-binding proteins and possesses stability to common plasmid- or chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases, including those enzymes that hydrolyze parenteral third generation cephalosporins. The microbiologic features for ceftibuten indicate its clinical potential as chemotherapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
TI  - The occurrence of duplicate lysyl-tRNA synthetase gene homologs in Escherichia coli and other procaryotes.
AB  - The lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) system of Escherichia coli K-12 consists of two genes, lysS, which is constitutive, and lysU, which is inducible. It is of importance to know how extensively the two-gene LysRS system is distributed in procaryotes, in particular, among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. To this end, the enterics E. coli K-12 and B; E. coli reference collection (ECOR) isolates EC2, EC49, EC65, and EC68; Shigella flexneri; Salmonella typhimurium; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Enterobacter aerogenes; Serratia marcescens; and Proteus vulgaris and the nonenterics Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus megaterium were grown in AC broth to a pH of 5.5 or less or cultured in SABO medium at pH 5.0. These growth conditions are known to induce LysRS activity (LysU synthesis) in E. coli K-12. Significant induction of LysRS activity (twofold or better) was observed in the E. coli strains, the ECOR isolates, S. flexneri, K. pneumoniae, and E. aerogenes. To demonstrate an association between LysRS induction and two distinct LysRS genes, Southern blotting was performed with a probe representing an 871-bp fragment amplified from an internal portion of the coding region of the lysU gene. In initial experiments, chromosomal DNA from E. coli K-12 strain MC4100 (lysS+ lysU+) was double digested with either BamHI and HindIII or BamHI and SalI, producing hybridizable fragments of 12.4 and 4.2 kb and 6.6 and 5.2 kb, respectively. Subjecting the chromosomal DNA of E. coli K-12 strain GNB10181 (lysS+ delta lysU) to the same regimen established that the larger fragment from each digestion contained the lysU gene. The results of Southern blot analysis of the other bacterial strains revealed that two hybridizable fragments were obtained from all of the E. coli and ECOR collection strains examined and S. flexneri, K. pneumoniae, and E. aerogenes. Only one lysU homolog was found with S. typhimurium and S. marcescens, and none was obtained with P. vulgaris. A single hybridizable band was found with both P. aeruginose and B, megaterium. These results show that the dual-gene LysRS system is not confined to E. coli K-12 and indicate that it may have first appeared in the genus Enterobacter.
TI  - The amino acid sequence of Lrp is highly conserved in four enteric microorganisms.
AB  - Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein) is a global regulator of metabolism in Escherichia coli (J. M. Calvo and R. G. Matthews, Microbiol. Rev. 58:466-490, 1994). The lrp genes from three other enteric microorganisms, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium, were cloned and sequenced. An analysis of these sequences and of the previously determined sequence from E. coli indicated that the vast majority of changes were synonymous rather than nonsynonymous changes. Nucleotide changes occurred at 89 of 492 positions but resulted in amino acid changes at only 2 of 164 positions. This analysis suggests that the Lrp amino acid sequence is highly adapted for function and that almost all amino acid changes lead to a protein that functions less well than the wild-type protein.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the signal peptidase II (lsp)-gene from Staphylococcus carnosus.
AB  - Staphylococcus carnosus TM300 is able to synthesize at least seven lipoproteins with molecular masses between 15 and 45 kDa; the proteins are located in the membrane fraction. It can be concluded that this strain also posesses the enzymes involved in lipoprotein modification and prolipoprotein signal peptidase (signal peptidase II) processing. The gene encoding the prolipoprotein signal peptidase, lsp, from Staphylococcus carnosus TM300 was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Lsp showed amino acid similarities with the Lsp's of S. aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. The hydropathy profile reveals four hydrophobic segments which are homologous to the putative transmembrane regions of the E. coli signal peptidase II. E. coli strains carrying lsp of S. carnosus exhibited an increased globomycin resistance.
TI  - Clinical disorders observed in anteaters (Myrmecophagidae, Edentata) in captivity.
AB  - The major health problems found in 103 captive lesser anteaters (Tamandua tetradactyla) and giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), family Myrmecophagidae, are presented and correlated with management. The most common of 200 recorded clinical disorders involved the digestive system (26%), nutritional deficiency (20%), injury (15.5%), respiratory system (10%), skin (7%) and circulatory system (4.5%), but 13% of the cases were inconclusive. Parasites were identified in 48.5% of faecal samples, mainly the eggs of nematodes (40%), of which the commonest were Trichuris spp (28%) and Strongyloides spp (11%); protozoa (16%), of which the commonest were Eimeria spp (10%), Entamoeba spp (5%) and Giardia spp (1%); and cestodes (8%) and acanthocephalids (1%). Bacteria cultured from the various materials included Salmonella enteritidis, S. cholerasuis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus spp and Staphylococcus spp. The ectoparasites found were Amblyomma spp and Otodectis spp (Arthropoda, Acaridae).
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological survey after change in aminoglycoside treatment to control an epidemic of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The effect of a change in the first line antibiotic treatment in a neonatal unit  was studied. A total of 238 neonates (G1), admitted between 1 January and 31 July 1989, and treated with gentamicin, were compared with 398 (G2) admitted between 1 August 1989 and 31 July 1990 who received amikacin, in the combination of ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside. This change was implemented in an attempt to prevent the spread of an epidemic strain of Enterobacter cloacae resistant to third generation cephalosporins and all aminoglycosides, except amikacin. The change in treatment had no effect on the incidence of nosocomial infections [19.7% (G1) vs. 16.3% (G2) RR = 1.21 (0.86-1.70)], but the proportion of patients with nosocomial infections caused by the E. cloacae decreased (6.3% vs. 2.0% RR 3.14 CI 1.35-7.28). Certain trends in the bacterial ecology emerged: E. aerogenes and Enterococci increased in G2. The proportion of gentamicin-resistant strains such as E. cloacae or Staphylococci decreased and there was no increase in aminoglycoside-resistant strains, except in Escherichia coli, in which resistance to amikacin rose from 0 to 3%. This study illustrates the influence of antimicrobial therapy on the species and the resistance of strains isolated in nosocomial infections. It also highlights the need for epidemiologic surveillance, and poses the question of how best to modify antibiotic policy.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CP-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. CP-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). The activity of CP-99,219 against Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, C. diversus, Helicobacter pylori, and K. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with MIC90 values to CP-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for CP-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. CP-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x MIC against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broths. The spectrum and potency observed with CP-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
TI  - Chiral inversion of drug: role of intestinal bacteria in the stereoselective sulphoxide reduction of flosequinan.
AB  - Chiral inversion at a sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers [(+/-)-7-fluoro-1-methyl-3-methylsulphinyl-4-quinolone] occurred in conventional rats but not in either germ-free rats or rats treated with antibiotics after an oral administration of each enantiomer. Thus, it was postulated that the chiral inversion occurred by mechanisms mediated by intestinal bacteria. The intestinal content isolated from conventional rats reduced R(+)- and S(-)-flosequinan to produce the sulphide, while intestinal content from rats treated with antibiotics did not reduce the drug. Several strains of facultative anaerobes possessed a high flosequinan reducing activity. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced R(+)-flosequinan to the sulphide stereoselectively. On the other hand, Enterobacter aerogenes and Micrococcus agilis exclusively reduced S(-)-flosequinan. The sulphide, which could be produced by intestinal bacteria from R(+)- and S(-)-flosequinan, was readily absorbed upon an oral administration to rats, and was oxidized fairly rapidly to R(+)- and S(-)-flosequinan and further to the sulphone form. Based on these data, it has been confirmed that chiral inversion at the sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers occur via stereoselective reduction of sulphoxide by intestinal bacteria to form the sulphide, followed by oxidation of the sulphide in the body to produce R(+)- and S(-)-flosequinan.
TI  - The tryptophan repressor sequence is highly conserved among the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tryptophan biosynthesis in Escherichia coli is regulated by the product of the trpR gene, the tryptophan (Trp) repressor. Trp aporepressor binds the corepressor, L-tryptophan, to form a holorepressor complex, which binds trp operator DNA tightly, and inhibits transcription of the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. The conservation of trp operator sequences among enteric Gram-negative bacteria suggests that trpR genes from other bacterial species can be cloned by complementation in E. coli. To clone trpR homologues, a deletion of the E. coli trpR gene, delta trpR504, was made on a plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, then crossed onto the E. coli genome. Plasmid clones of the trpR genes of Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae were isolated by complementation of the delta trpR504 allele, scored as the ability to repress beta-galactosidase synthesis from a prophage-borne trpE-lacZ gene fusion. The predicted amino acid sequences of four enteric TrpR proteins show differences, clustered on the backside of the folded repressor, opposite the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix substructures. These differences are predicted to have little effect on the interactions of the aporepressor with tryptophan, holorepressor with operator DNA, or tandemly bound holorepressor dimers with one another. Although there is some variation observed at the dimer interface, interactions predicted to stabilize the interface are conserved. The phylogenetic relationships revealed by the TrpR amino acid sequence alignment agree with the results of others.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - [Comparative study of single strand conformation polymorphism of 4.5S RNA gene in enterobacteria].
AB  - A recently developed technique, non-isotopic single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP), was applied to study the conserved feature of 4.5S RNA gene in enterobacteria. The 4.5S RNA gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using the template DNA extracted respectively from five strains of Escherichia coli and three strains of different genera in Enterobacteriaceae, i.e. Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes. The PCR products were then carried out SSCP analysis. The experimental results showed that there seemed to be no detectable differences in the size and single strand conformation of 4.5S RNA genes from above strains, except the negative strand conformation of Enterobacter aerogenes. Thus it can be seen that the secondary structures of 4.5S RNA gene in enterobacteria are quite conservative.
TI  - Comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
AB  - The study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. Each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. Mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/L for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. For the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/L for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/L for ofloxacin. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) for each drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against A. anitratus. MBCs for the two drugs were similar for H. influenzae and S. aureus. Oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent SBA. Similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent SBA. For the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak SBA was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the Enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. At peak concentrations, both drugs had modest SBA against P. aeruginosa, A. anitratus, and S. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a tryptophanase gene from Enterobacter aerogenes  SM-18.
AB  - A tryptophanase gene from Enterobacter aerogenes SM-18 was cloned and sequenced.  The structural gene for tryptophanase, tnaA, consisted of 1389 bp encoding 462 amino acid residues, and its nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence showed significant homology to those of tnaA from Escherichia coli K12. A short open reading frame consisting of 31 amino acid residues was found upstream of tnaA, and it showed some similarity to the E. coli tnaC gene known to be a cis-acting regulatory element for transcription. A partial open reading frame homologous to the 5' end of E. coli tnaB was observed at the 3'-flanking region of tnaA. These genes may thus constitute an operon as in E. coli.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oil from Schinus molle Linn.
AB  - The essential oil from the fresh leaves of Schinus molle isolated by hydrodistillation was tested for antibacterial activity using the hole plate diffusion method and for antifungal activity using the mycelium or single cell growth inhibition method. Results obtained showed that the volatile oil exhibited significant activity against the following bacterial species: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Alcaligenes faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Leuconostoc cremoris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Clostridium sporogenes, Acinetobacter calcoacetica, Escherichia coli, Beneckea natriegens, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus subtilis and Brochothrix thermosphacata. The fungal species Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus parasiticus, Fusarium culmorum and Alternaria alternata exhibited significant sensitivity to the volatile oil.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the Enterobacter aerogenes tonB gene: identification of a novel type of tonB box suppressor mutant.
AB  - The tonB gene of Enterobacter aerogenes was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. It complemented an E. coli tonB mutant as efficiently as E. coli tonB, except for colicin B and D sensitivities. However, colicin B and D sensitivities were complemented by a derivative in which the aspartate at position 165 was replaced by a glutamine (TonBD-165-->Q) by site-directed mutagenesis. In E. coli, the corresponding amino acid is a glutamine (Q-160) which is known to be altered in most mutants showing suppression of the btuB451 mutation. Fourteen independent btuB451 suppressor mutations in E. aerogenes tonB which all had suffered the same point mutation resulting in a change from glycine to valine at position 239 (G-239-->V) of the C-terminal end of the protein were isolated. The mutation was located within a region which is nonessential for function of E. aerogenes TonB as well as E. coli TonB. A constructed double mutation, expressing a D-165-->Q/G-239-->V derivative, no longer acted as a btuB451 suppressor. However, it restored colicin B and D sensitivities even more efficiently than the D-165-->Q derivative. Corresponding mutations constructed in E. coli tonB, giving rise to Q-160-->D, G-234-->V, and Q-160-->D/G-234-->V derivatives, showed phenotypes comparable to the E. aerogenes mutations. We take this as evidence that at least a functional interaction between the D-165 (Q-160 in E. coli) and the G-239 (G-234 in E. coli) region is necessary for TonB function. The implications of this interaction for functional instability of TonB are discussed.
TI  - T lymphocyte responses to antigens of gram-negative bacteria in pyelonephritis.
AB  - We showed previously that large numbers of T lymphocytes accumulate within a few  days in the kidneys of rats with ascending pyelonephritis induced with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CD4+ T cells propagated from the lesions exhibited MHC-restricted proliferative responses to formalin-fixed bacteria of the species used to induce infection. In the present study we investigated further the nature of the antigens responsible for the T cell proliferation and studied the ability of different bacterial strains and species to produce proliferative responses. We found that heat-killed bacteria were more stimulatory than formalin-fixed bacteria, and that soluble supernatants of heat-killed organism were also effective. The stimulatory effects of supernatants were destroyed by trypsin and the responses were MHC-restricted. Twelve different E. coli strains, with or without characteristics of uropathogenicity in humans, were all highly stimulatory to T cells derived from a kidney infected with a single E. coli strain. Strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Serratia marcescens--species of Enterobacteriaceae closely related to E. coli--were also stimulatory, whereas more distantly related bacteria--Proteus, Morganella, and P. aeruginosa--were not. T cells propagated from kidneys infected with P. aeruginosa responded to supernatants of this organism, but not to E. coli supernatants. We conclude that a protein antigen (or antigens) shared by strains of E. coli and related Enterobacteriaceae, but not by other gram-negative bacteria, produce MHC-restricted proliferative responses of CD4+ T cells that infiltrate rat kidneys infected with E. coli.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the Klebsiella pneumoniae tonB gene and characterization of Escherichia coli-K. pneumoniae TonB hybrid proteins.
AB  - The tonB gene of Klebsiella pneumoniae was cloned on a 1.4-kb EcoRV fragment and  expressed in Escherichia coli. Determination of the nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cloned fragment identified tonB as an open reading frame (ORF) of 729 nt. The TonB protein consists of 243 amino acids (aa) and is highly homologous to Enterobacter aerogenes TonB. The genetic context of K. pneumoniae and En. aerogenes tonB is the same, but is different from that of E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Serratia marcescens. K. pneumoniae tonB complemented an E. coli tonB mutant as efficiently as E. coli tonB when cloned on the same type of plasmid. Replacement of the highly hydrophobic C terminus of E. coli TonB by the weakly hydrophobic C terminus of K. pneumoniae TonB yielded a hybrid protein of the same activity as E. coli wild-type TonB. The result shows that the strong hydrophobicity of the C-terminal end is not necessary for the function of E. coli TonB.
TI  - Properties of isochorismate hydroxymutase from Flavobacterium K3-15.
AB  - Isochorismate hydroxymutase (isochorismate synthase, E.C. 5.4.99.6) catalyzes the interconversion of chorismic acid [1] and isochorismic acid [2]. The enzyme was extracted from a Flavobacterium K3-15 that overproduces vitamin K2 (i.e., menaquinones) and was purified to homogeneity. The N-terminal amino acid sequence and the mol wt (36,240 +/- 100 daltons) were determined by ms following SDS PAG electrophoresis. The enzyme was characterized (stability, cofactor requirement, isoelectrical point), and antibodies were raised which showed no cross reactivity with isochorismate hydroxymutase from Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes 62-1. The kinetic data of the enzyme are different from those observed for the corresponding enzyme from Escherichia coli and Galium mollugo.
TI  - Isolation of Acanthamoeba sp. from a greyhound with pneumonia and granulomatous amebic encephalitis.
AB  - Acanthamoeba were isolated from a naturally occurring animal infection of granulomatous amebic encephalitis. The amebas were grown from lung lesions from a 1-year-old greyhound puppy, which was 1 of several dogs in a kennel that was affected by a progressive fatal neurologic and respiratory disease. The Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, confirmed the disease to be acanthamebiasis and specifically identified the amebas as Acanthamoeba culbertsoni by fluorescent antibody testing on brain tissue from the dog. The amebas were cultured initially on potato dextrose agar and on nonnutrient agar plates that were seeded with a lawn of nonpathogenic Escherichia coli. The isolate was then transferred to nonnutrient agar plates containing killed Enterobacter aerogenes and subsequently to axenic medium and cell cultures. The isolate was highly pathogenic by intranasal inoculation into 2-week-old mice.
TI  - Characterization of the genes of the 2,3-butanediol operons from Klebsiella terrigena and Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - The genes involved in the 2,3-butanediol pathway coding for alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase, alpha-acetolactate synthase (alpha-ALS), and acetoin (diacetyl) reductase were isolated from Klebsiella terrigena and shown to be located in one operon. This operon was also shown to exist in Enterobacter aerogenes. The budA gene, coding for alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase, gives in both organisms a protein of 259 amino acids. The amino acid similarity between these proteins is 87%. The K. terrigena genes budB and budC, coding for alpha-ALS and acetoin reductase, respectively, were sequenced. The 559-amino-acid-long alpha-ALS enzyme shows similarities to the large subunits of the Escherichia coli anabolic alpha-ALS enzymes encoded by the genes ilvB, ilvG, and ilvI. The K. terrigena alpha-ALS is also shown to complement an anabolic alpha-ALS-deficient E. coli strain for valine synthesis. The 243-amino-acid-long acetoin reductase has the consensus amino acid sequence for the insect-type alcohol dehydrogenase/ribitol dehydrogenase family and has extensive similarities with the N-terminal and internal regions of three known dehydrogenases and one oxidoreductase.
TI  - Sulphonate utilization by enteric bacteria.
AB  - A variety of sulphonates were tested for their ability to serve as nutrients for  Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia marcescens. Cysteate, taurine and isethionate could not serve as sole sources of carbon and energy but, under aerobic conditions, could be utilized as sources of sulphur. Both sulphate and sulphonate supported equivalent cell yields, but the generation times varied with the sulphonate being metabolized. The sulphonate-S of HEPES buffer, dodecane sulphonate and methane sulphonate was also utilized by some strains, whereas the sulphonate-S of taurocholate was not. None of the sulphonates tested served as a sulphur source for growth under anaerobic conditions. Sulphonate utilization appears to be a constitutive trait; surprisingly, however, cells of E. coli and Ent. aerogenes utilized sulphate-S in preference to that of sulphonate, when both were present. E. coli mutants unable to use sulphate as a source of sulphur because of deficiencies in sulphate permease, ATP sulphurylase, adenylylsulphate kinase (APS kinase) or glutaredoxin and thioredoxin were able to utilize sulphonates; hence sulphate is not an obligatory intermediate in sulphonate utilization. However, mutants deficient in sulphite reductase were unable to utilize sulphonates; therefore, this enzyme must be involved in sulphonate utilization, though it is not yet known whether it acts upon the sulphonates themselves or upon the inorganic sulphite derived from them.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a gene encoding a 21-kilodalton outer membrane protein  from Bordetella avium and expression of the gene in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Three gene libraries of Bordetella avium 197 DNA were prepared in Escherichia coli LE392 by using the cosmid vectors pCP13 and pYA2329, a derivative of pCP13 specifying spectinomycin resistance. The cosmid libraries were screened with convalescent-phase anti-B. avium turkey sera and polyclonal rabbit antisera against B. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. One E. coli recombinant clone produced a 56-kDa protein which reacted with convalescent-phase serum from a turkey infected with B. avium 197. In addition, five E. coli recombinant clones were identified which produced B. avium outer membrane proteins with molecular masses of 21, 38, 40, 43, and 48 kDa. At least one of these E. coli clones, which encoded the 21-kDa protein, reacted with both convalescent-phase turkey sera and antibody against B. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. The gene for the 21-kDa outer membrane protein was localized by Tn5seq1 mutagenesis, and the nucleotide sequence was determined by dideoxy sequencing. DNA sequence analysis of the 21-kDa protein revealed an open reading frame of 582 bases that resulted in a predicted protein of 194 amino acids. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the gene encoding the 21-kDa outer membrane protein with protein sequences in the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein sequence data base indicated significant homology to the OmpA proteins of Shigella dysenteriae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, and Salmonella typhimurium and to Neisseria gonorrhoeae outer membrane protein III, Haemophilus influenzae protein P6, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa porin protein F. The gene (ompA) encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein hybridized with 4.1-kb DNA fragments from EcoRI-digested, chromosomal DNA of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica and with 6.0- and 3.2-kb DNA fragments from EcoRI-digested, chromosomal DNA of B. avium and B. avium-like DNA, respectively. A 6.75-kb DNA fragment encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein was subcloned into the Asd+ vector pYA292, and the construct was introduced into the avirulent delta cya delta crp delta asd S. typhimurium chi 3987 for oral immunization of birds. The gene encoding the 21-kDa protein was expressed equivalently in B. avium 197, delta asd E. coli chi 6097, and S. typhimurium chi 3987 and was localized primarily in the cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane. In preliminary studies on oral inoculation of turkey poults with S. typhimurium chi 3987 expressing the gene encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein, it was determined that a single dose of the recombinant Salmonella vaccine failed to elicit serum antibodies against the 21-kDa protein and challenge with wild-type B. avium 197 resulted in colonization of the trachea and thymus with B. avium 197.
TI  - Survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the Royal London Hospital.
AB  - beta-Lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive Gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Royal London Hospital. This survey, performed between January and April, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. The distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. This increase was balanced by a decreased proportion of enterobacteria. Amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, TEM-1 (especially), TEM-2, SHV-1 and OXA types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. Their frequency in Escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst Proteus mirabilis isolates. An apparent decrease in their frequency amongst Enterobacter cloacae isolates, from 48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. Plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of P. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. In the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of E. cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia spp. and Morganella morganii, and in 2/170 P. aeruginosa isolates. These proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (P approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). Extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were found in 11/70 Klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. Ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced TEM-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified SHV-derived enzyme.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (SISO), MICs of SISO as well as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. Results are summarized below: 1. No SISO-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii. 2. In comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was higher, and SISO-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the MRSA. Also, SISO-resistant strains of Serratia marcescens increased. However, the rate of SISO-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, SISO-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. MICs of SISO against Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of SISO was weak against genus Providencia. 4. For comparison, according to MICs of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. 5. SISO is still one of the useful AGs in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Q-35, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Q-35, an 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin. The MICs of Q-35 for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were 0.2, 6.25, 0.2, 0.39, and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of Q-35 was 4- to 16-fold greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin but equal to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against these organisms. For 82 ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci (MIC90 = 100 micrograms/ml), Q-35 was the most active of the new quinolones tested (MIC90 = 6.25 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s of Q-35 against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.2, 0.78, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, and Q-35 was 2- to 16-fold less active than the other quinolones tested. Q-35 showed potent bactericidal activity and inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. NAGase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of Actinomyces pyogenes (P less than 0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Similarly NAGase treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees C. NAGase did not reduce the numbers of Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. Since NAGase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - Klebsiella pneumoniae as a spoilage organism in mozzarella cheese.
AB  - A high concentration of total and fecal coliforms (5 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(7) cfu/g, respectively) was observed in samples representative of two production lots of Mozzarella cheese from a local dairy. Contamination was manifested by the swelling of plastic pouches and the formation of gas holes in Mozzarella cheese. Aerobic and anaerobic sporeformers, heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, propionibacteria, and yeasts were absent. Of the 41 isolates identified, there were 37 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, and 1 Escherichia coli. Exposure at 63 degrees C for 15 min caused the death of all total and fecal coliforms.
TI  - Mobilization of nonconjugative pBR322-derivative plasmids from laboratory strains of Escherichia coli to bacteria isolated from seawater.
AB  - Mobilization of derivatives of plasmids pBR322 and pBR325 was shown to occur between Escherichia coli K12 strains in LB-broth at 37 degrees C, provided a mobilizer plasmid (F') was present either together with the nonconjugative plasmid or in a second donor strain. Evidence from restriction endonuclease analysis suggested that the mobilization was facilitated by a transposition phenomenon involving the "gamma-delta" sequence of F'. It was shown that mobilization of a derivative of pBR325 from E. coli K12 to bacteria isolated from seawater occurred in incubations in both LB-broth and filtered seawater and that Pseudomonas sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, E. coli, and Citrobacter amalonaticus isolates were recipient-active.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of kikA, a region on IncN group plasmids that determines killing of Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - Transfer of the IncN group plasmid pCU1 from Escherichia coli to Klebsiella oxytoca by conjugation kills a large proportion (90 to 95%) of the recipients of plasmid DNA, whereas transfer to E. coli or even to the closely related Enterobacter aerogenes does not. Two regions, kikA and kikB, have been identified on pCU1 that contribute to the Kik (killing in klebsiellas) phenotype. We have localized the kikA region to 500 bp by deletion analysis and show by DNA-DNA hybridization that kikA is highly conserved among the plasmids of incompatibility group N. The expression in K. oxytoca of kikA under the control of the strong inducible E. coli tac promoter results in loss of cell viability. The nucleotide sequence showed two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) within the kikA region. The first ORF codes for a putative polypeptide of 104 amino acids (ORF104). The second ORF codes for a 70-amino-acid polypeptide (ORF70). The properties of the putative protein encoded by ORF104 and gene fusions of kikA to alkaline phosphatase by using TnphoA suggest that killing may involve an association with the bacterial membrane; however, we could not rule out the possibility that ORF70 plays a role in the Kik phenotype.
TI  - Evidence for two phosphonate degradative pathways in Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - We screened mini-Mu plasmid libraries from Enterobacter aerogenes IFO 12010 for plasmids that complement Escherichia coli phn mutants that cannot use phosphonates (Pn) as the sole source of phosphorus (P). We isolated two kinds of plasmids that, unexpectedly, encode genes for different metabolic pathways. One kind complements E. coli mutants with both Pn transport and Pn catalysis genes deleted; these plasmids allow degradation of the 2-carbon-substituted Pn alpha-aminoethylphosphonate but not of unsubstituted alkyl Pn. This substrate specificity is characteristic of a phosphonatase pathway, which is absent in E. coli. The other kind complements E. coli mutants with Pn catalysis genes deleted but not those with both transport and catalysis genes deleted; these plasmids allow degradation of both substituted and unsubstituted Pn. Such a broad substrate specificity is characteristic of a carbon-phosphorus (C-P) lyase pathway, which is common in gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli. Further proof that the two kinds of plasmids encode genes for different pathways was demonstrated by the lack of DNA homology between the plasmids. In particular, the phosphonatase clone from E. aerogenes failed to hybridize to the E. coli phnCDEFGHIJKLMNOP gene cluster for Pn uptake and degradation, while the E. aerogenes C-P lyase clone hybridized strongly to the E. coli phnGHIJKLM genes encoding C-P lyase but not to the E. coli phnCDE genes encoding Pn transport. Specific hybridization by the E. aerogenes C-P lyase plasmid to the E. coli phnF, phnN, phnO, and phnP genes was not determined. Furthermore, we showed that one or more genes encoding the apparent E. aerogenes phosphonatase pathway, like the E. coli phnC-to-phnP gene cluster, is under phosphate regulon control in E. coli. This highlights the importance of Pn in bacterial P assimilation in nature.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Staphylococcus aureus signal peptidase II (lsp) gene.
AB  - The lsp gene encoding prolipoprotein signal peptidase (signal peptidase II) of Staphylococcus aureus was cloned by screening a genomic library for plasmid clones capable of complementing a conditionally lethal lsp allele of Escherichia coli. E. coli cells carrying one of five overlapping clones exhibited increased resistance to globomycin. The nucleotide sequence of the S. aureus lsp gene was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the signal peptidase II of S. aureus suggests that this enzyme has a hydropathy profile very similar to those of E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Comparison of the primary structures of this enzyme from these four distinct bacterial species reveals three highly conserved domains in proteins which have a low degree of overall sequence homology. Unlike the lsp genes from the Gram-negative bacteria, the lsp gene in S. aureus is not flanked by x-ileS and orf149-orf316 as found in E. coli, Ent. aerogenes, and P. fluorescens.
TI  - tolQ is required for cloacin DF13 susceptibility in Escherichia coli expressing the aerobactin/cloacin DF13 receptor IutA.
AB  - We investigated the role of the tolQ gene in the import of cloacin DF13 across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli strains expressing the IutA receptor. The IutA outer-membrane protein is the receptor for the siderophore ferric aerobactin and also binds cloacin DF13, a bacteriocin produced by strains of Enterobacter aerogenes. In this report we present evidence that tolQ is required for the internalization of cloacin DF13 upon binding to IutA but it is not involved in the transport of ferric aerobactin.
TI  - Distribution of an L-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase in eubacteria.
AB  - A protein carboxyl methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl or L-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal L-aspartyl and L-asparaginyl residues. A similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. In this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), Rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. DNA probes from the E. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal DNA of the enteric species. Interestingly, no activity was found in the plant pathogen Erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in Rhizobium meliloti or Rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. Additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species Bacillus subtilis, B. stearothermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Streptomyces griseus. The absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence of inhibitors in the extracts. These results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. Since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal cellular physiology.
TI  - Retrospective 6-year study of enterobacter bacteraemia in a Danish university hospital.
AB  - In order to study the epidemiology of invasive enterobacter infections, data from 53 consecutive cases of bacteraemia due to this organism were compared with data from 72 randomly selected cases of Escherichia coli bacteraemia. The cases occurred among patients admitted to a Danish University hospital over a 6-year period. Forty-eight cases were due to Enterobacter cloacae and five were due to Ent. aerogenes. Enterobacter bacteraemia was more often of nosocomial origin than E. coli bacteraemia and more often polymicrobial. Patients suffering from enterobacter bacteraemia were younger than E. coli patients, and males tended to predominate. Apart from cancer of the prostate, other malignant diseases tended to be more frequent among patients with enterobacter bacteraemia than among E. coli patients. Enterobacter bacteraemia was more often associated with a focus in central venous catheters and burns, whereas patients with E. coli bacteraemia more often showed a focus of infection in the urinary tract. Patients with enterobacter bacteraemia and a microbiologically documented focus in the respiratory tract or the urinary tract more often had an endotracheal tube or indwelling urinary catheter compared to patients with E. coli bacteraemia with a similar focus of infection. In patients with no microbiologically documented focus enterobacter bacteraemia was more often associated with the presence of central and peripheral venous catheters. During the preceding 12 weeks patients with enterobacter bacteraemia, more often than E. coli patients, had been treated with beta-lactam antibiotics, especially penicillins. The close association with devices may indicate that Enterobacter has a special affinity for foreign body material. Studies are planned to elucidate this aspect in further detail.
TI  - Detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyrA.
AB  - Two plasmids containing the cloned Escherichia coli wild-type gyrA gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for DNA gyrase A-mediated quinolone resistance. The results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of Gram-negative species including E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The use of an arithmetical MIC series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening for the detection of altered gyrase A. The observations were consistent with the suggestion that DNA gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase A-mediated resistance can occur in all.
TI  - Novel plasmid vectors for gene cloning in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Novel host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus Pseudomonas. We found that a new Pseudomonas strain, Pseudomonas flavida IF-4, isolated from soil, carried two small cryptic plasmids, named pNI10 and pNI20. They were multi-copy, but not self-transmissible, and the genome size was 3.7 kb for pNI10 and 2.9 kb for pNI20. Several types of cloning vectors containing a kanamycin or streptomycin resistance (Kmr or Smr) gene were constructed from pNI10 and pNI20. These plasmid vectors were efficiently transformed into several strains of Pseudomonas at a frequency up to 4 x 10(5) transformants per 1 microgram plasmid DNA by the usual competent cell method. The vectors derived from pNI10 replicated not only in Pseudomonas but also in some other Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Temporal and topological clustering of diverged residues among enterobacterial dihydrofolate reductases.
AB  - The complete nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequences were determined for the  dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from the bacteria Enterobacter aerogenes and Citrobacter freundii. These were compared with the closely related Escherichia coli DHFR sequence. The ancestral DHFR sequence common to these three species was reconstructed. Since that ancestor there have been seven, nine, and one amino acid replacements in E. coli, E. aerogenes, and C. freundii, respectively. In E. coli, five of its seven replacements were located in the beta-sheet portion of the protein, and all seven were located in a single restricted region of the protein. In E. aerogenes, all nine of its replacements were located within surface residues, with five clustered in a region topologically distinct from the E. coli cluster. The replaced side chains are sometimes in direct contact but more often are separated by an intervening side chain. It is argued that the temporal clustering of replacements is typical for the evolution of most proteins and that the associated topological clustering gives a picture of how evolutionary change is accommodated by protein structure.
TI  - Fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. The frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. In this study isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. Type 3, P, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. The Klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. Also, both type 3 and Escherichia coli P fimbrial genotypes were detected by using DNA colony blot assays. The frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: Enterobacter (38.6%), Klebsiella (26.8%), Serratia (17.7%), E. coli (13%), and Proteus (5.2%). Isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. The phenotype and genotype for E. coli P fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. In addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes. Finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among K. oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis isolates. The frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.
TI  - Selected faecal bacteria and nutrients essential for antagonism of Salmonella typhimurium in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  - As few as five of the species of bacteria commonly found in human faeces--Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus and Fusobacterium varium--when grown together in anaerobic continuous flow cultures exerted antagonistic effects on Salmonella typhimurium as great as those given by mixed bacteria from extracts of human faeces. In a single culture, the population of S. typhimurium was c. 10(8) cfu/ml but in mixed cultures with the five antagonistic bacteria or mixed faecal bacteria it was reduced to c. 10(3) cfu/ml. Antagonism appeared to be the result of competition for the growth limiting amino acids, arginine, serine, threonine and aspartic acid. Optimal manifestation of antagonism required the presence of carbon sources fermentable only by antagonistic bacteria, such as lactose 0.1%, w/v, sucrose 0.1% (w/v) and starch 0.2-0.3% w/v. These carbohydrates promoted the growth of the antagonistic bacteria, particularly E. coli and B. ovatus. However, an increase in concentration by several fold of any one of four growth-limiting amino acids in the medium diminished the antagonistic effects and the population of S. typhimurium rose 10(2)-10(3)-fold.
TI  - Growth kinetics of coliform bacteria under conditions relevant to drinking water  distribution systems.
AB  - The growth of environmental and clinical coliform bacteria under conditions typical of drinking water distribution systems was examined. Four coliforms (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae) were isolated from an operating drinking water system for study; an enterotoxigenic E. coli strain and clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli were also used. All but one of the coliforms tested were capable of growth in unsupplemented mineral salts medium; the environmental isolates had greater specific growth rates than did the clinical isolates. This trend was maintained when the organisms were grown with low levels (less than 1 mg liter-1) of yeast extract. The environmental K. pneumoniae isolate had a greater yield, higher specific growth rates, and a lower Ks value than the other organisms. The environmental E. coli and the enterotoxigenic E. coli strains had comparable yield, growth rate, and Ks values to those of the environmental K. pneumoniae strain, and all three showed significantly more successful growth than the clinical isolates. The environmental coliforms also grew well at low temperatures on low concentrations of yeast extract. Unsupplemented distribution water from the collaborating utility supported the growth of the environmental isolates. Growth of the K. pneumoniae water isolate was stimulated by the addition of autoclaved biofilm but not by tubercle material. These findings indicate that growth of environmental coliforms is possible under the conditions found in operating municipal drinking water systems and that these bacteria could be used in tests to determine assimilable organic carbon in potable water.
TI  - Structure and function of a bacterial mRNA stabilizer: analysis of the 5' untranslated region of ompA mRNA.
AB  - The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the Escherichia coli ompA transcript functions in vivo as a growth rate-regulated mRNA stabilizer. The secondary structure of this mRNA segment has been determined by a combination of three methods: phylogenetic analysis, in vitro probing with a structure-specific RNase, and methylation by dimethylsulfate in vivo and in vitro. These studies reveal that despite extensive sequence differences, the 5' UTRs of the ompA transcripts of E. coli, Serratia marcescens, and Enterobacter aerogenes can fold in a remarkably similar fashion. Furthermore, the Serratia and Enterobacter ompA 5' UTRs function as effective mRNA stabilizers in E. coli. Stabilization of mRNA by the Serratia ompA 5' UTR is growth rate dependent. These findings indicate that the features of the ompA 5' UTR responsible for its ability to stabilize mRNA in a growth rate-regulated manner are to be found among the structural similarities shared by these diverse evolutionary variants.
TI  - Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent histidine decarboxylases. Cloning, sequencing, and  expression of genes from Klebsiella planticola and Enterobacter aerogenes and properties of the overexpressed enzymes.
AB  - The hdc genes encoding the inducible pyridoxal-P-dependent histidine decarboxylase (HisDCase) of Klebsiella planticola and Enterobacter aerogenes were isolated, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli under control of the lac promoter, and the overproduced enzymes were purified to homogeneity from the recombinant host. Formation of inclusion bodies during synthesis of the E. aerogenes enzyme was avoided by cooling the culture and inducing at 25 degrees C. The cloned enzymes were produced in amounts three to four times those present in the fully induced native hosts and were identical in properties to those isolated earlier (Guirard, B. M., and Snell, E. E. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 3963-3968). The two enzymes showed 85% sequence identity and also showed 80% sequence identity with the previously sequenced (Vaaler, G. L., Brasch, M. A., and Snell, E. E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11010-11014) HisDCase of Morganella morganii. Nevertheless, antibodies to the M. morganii HisDCase do not cross-react with these enzymes suggesting that the regions of amino acid variations are located on the outer surface of the proteins. All three HisDCases are the same length (377 amino acid residues); encoded N-terminal methionine was completely removed in each case. These closely related pyridoxal-P enzymes show no sequence homology with the pyruvoyl-dependent HisDCases of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Concomitant dissemination of three extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among different Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a French hospital.
AB  - From January 1988 to August 1989, 267 non-repetitive strains of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBla) derived from TEM (CTX-1/TEM-3, CAZ-6) or SHV (CAZ-5) were isolated from 219 colonized or infected patients. ESBlas were characterized by analytical isoelectric focusing. Biotypes, resistance phenotypes and plasmid patterns were determined in order to differentiate the isolates in each species. Among the 116 CTX-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae, 48 strains were differentiated: 27 from 74 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, seven from 22 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates, and 14 from a combined total of seven K. oxytoca, five Serratia marcescens, six Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter cloacae and 1 Citrobacter freundii. CAZ-5 has been isolated since January 1988 in 16 different strains among 101 K. pneumoniae isolates. CAZ-6 was first identified in K. pneumoniae (January 1988). Among the 48 Enterobacteriaceae producing CAZ-6, 12 strains were differentiated: four from 39 E. aerogenes isolates, three from four K. pneumoniae, and five from a combined total of two S. marcescens, two E. coli and one E. cloacae. During this outbreak, CTX-1 was found to be encoded by 85 kb (Inc 7/M) or greater than or equal to 150 kb (Inc 6/C) plasmids. CAZ-6 was always encoded by an 85 kb (Inc 7/M) plasmid and CAZ-5 by a greater than 150 kb plasmid. These results show that strain epidemics and plasmid dissemination occurred mainly in K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes for CTX-1, in E. aerogenes for CAZ-6, and in K. pneumoniae for CAZ-5. They also suggest that the bla(tem) gene (CTX-1) has spread between different plasmids present in the same ecosystem.
TI  - Interspecies compatibility of selenoprotein biosynthesis in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Several species of Enterobacteriaceae were investigated for their ability to synthesize selenium-containing macromolecules. Seleniated tRNA species as well as seleniated polypeptides were formed by all organisms tested. Two selenopolypeptides could be identified in most of the organisms which correspond to the 80 kDa and 110 kDa subunits of the anaerobically induced formate dehydrogenase isoenzymes of E. coli. In those organisms possessing both isoenzymes, their synthesis was induced in a mutually exclusive manner dependent upon whether nitrate was present during anaerobic growth. The similarity of the 80 kDa selenopolypeptide among the different species was assessed by immunological and genetic analyses. Antibodies raised against the 80 kDa selenopolypeptide from E. coli cross-reacted with an 80 kDa polypeptide in those organisms which exhibited fermentative formate dehydrogenase activity. These organisms also contained genes which hybridised with the fdhF gene from E. coli. In an attempt to identify the signals responsible for incorporation of selenium into the selenopolypeptides in these organisms we cloned a portion of the fdhF gene homologue from Enterobacter aerogenes. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned 723 bp fragment was determined and it was shown to contain an in-frame TGA (stop) codon at the position corresponding to that present in the E. coli gene. This fragment was able to direct incorporation of selenocysteine when expressed in the heterologous host, E. coli. Moreover, the E. coli fdhF gene was expressed in Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis, indicating a high degree of conservation of the seleniating system throughout the enterobacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity and stability against novel beta-lactamases of investigational  beta-lactams (cefepime, cefpirome, flomoxef, SCE2787 and piperacillin plus tazobactam) in comparison with established compounds (cefotaxime, latamoxef and piperacillin).
AB  - The therapeutic perspectives of flomoxef, SCE 2787, cefpirome, cefepime, latamoxef, cefotaxime and of piperacillin plus tazobactam were comparatively evaluated by their in vitro activity against 1119 clinical isolates of 83 bacterial species. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. were about equally susceptible to the cephalosporins (MIC90: 0.06 to 0.5 mg/l), while the MIC90 for piperacillin plus tazobactam was between 2 and 16 mg/l. Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia spp. were most susceptible to SCE 2787, cefpirome and cefepime (MIC90: 0.06 to 2 mg/l) followed by latamoxef, cefotaxime, flomoxef and piperacillin plus tazobactam. For Citrobacter spp., Providencia spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica MIC90 were between 0.06 and 0.5 mg/l. Flomoxef was between 2 to 4 log2 less active against these species but more active than piperacillin plus tazobactam (MIC90: 2 and 8 mg/l). Morganella morganii and Hafnia alvei were most susceptible to cefepime, cefpirome and latamoxef (MIC90: 0.13 to 0.5 mg/l) while cefotaxime (MIC90: 8 mg/l) and piperacillin plus tazobactam (MIC90: 8 and greater than 64 mg/l) were the least active compounds. SCE 2787, cefepime and cefpirome were the most potent beta-lactams against the majority of the 13 species of non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) investigated (MIC90: 0.5 to 16 mg/l). The oxacephems were the least active compounds against NFB. Cefepime was the most active of the compounds included against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90: 16 mg/l). Haemophilus spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Bordetella pertussis were most susceptible to cefotaxime (MIC90: 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l). Latamoxef had the lowest activity of all compounds against gram-positive cocci. Flomoxef was the most active compound against penicillinase producing Staphylococcus aureus and about equally active as the other betalactams against methicillin susceptible staphylococci of other staphylococcal species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas fluorescens signal peptidase II gene (lsp) and flanking genes.
AB  - The lsp gene encoding prolipoprotein signal peptidase (signal peptidase II) is organized into an operon consisting of ileS and three open reading frames, designated genes x, orf149, and orf316 in both Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. A plasmid, pBROC128, containing a 5.8-kb fragment of Pseudomonas fluorescens DNA was found to confer pseudomonic acid resistance on E. coli host cells and to contain the structural gene of ileS from P. fluorescens. In addition, E. coli strains carrying pBROC128 exhibited increased globomycin resistance. This indicated that the P. fluorescens lsp gene was present on the plasmid. The nucleotide sequences of the P. fluorescens lsp gene and of its flanking regions were determined. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the lsp genes in E. coli and P. fluorescens revealed two highly conserved domains in this enzyme. Furthermore, the five genes which constitute an operon in E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes were found in P. fluorescens in the same order as in the first two species.
TI  - Homology among bacterial catalase genes.
AB  - Catalase activities in crude extracts of exponential and stationary phase cultures of various bacteria were visualized following gel electrophoresis for comparison with the enzymes from Escherichia coli. Citrobacter freundii, Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium exhibited patterns of catalase activity similar to E. coli, including bifunctional HPI-like bands and a monofunctional HPII-like band. Proteus mirabilis, Erwinia carotovora, and Serratia marcescens contained a single band of monofunctional catalase with a mobility intermediate between the HPI-like and HPII-like bands. The cloned genes for catalases HPI (katG) and HPII (katE) from E. coli were used as probes in Southern hybridization analyses for homologous sequences in genomic DNA of the same bacteria. katG was found to hybridize with fragments from C. freudii, Ent. aerogenes, Sal. typhimurium, and K. pneumoniae but not at all with Ed. tarda, P. mirabilis, S. marcesens, or Er. carotovora. katE hybridized with C. freundii and K. pneumoniae DNAs and not with the other bacterial DNAs.
TI  - Growth inhibition of selected food-borne bacteria, particularly Listeria monocytogenes, by plant extracts.
AB  - Six extracts from Chinese medicinal plants: Tin Men Chu, Sey Lau Pai, Siu Mao Heung, Bak Tao Yung, Kam Chin Chiu and Liao Ya, were tested for their inhibitory effect on selected food-borne bacteria by the well assay technique. Among them, Tin Men Chu, Siu Mao Heung and Sey Lau Pai inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi, Salm. enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, and three strains of Listeria monocytogenes. Two of these three extracts, Tin Men Chu and Siu Mao Heung, suppressed the growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A in cabbage juice. This inhibition was prevented by the addition of protein but not sodium chloride. Plant extracts show potential to control the growth of food-borne bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Construction of mobilizable vectors derived from plasmids RP4, pUC18 and pUC19.
AB  - Mobilizable narrow-host-range plasmids were constructed from pUC18 and pUC19 by addition of a segment of pSUP2021 bearing the basis of mobilization (bom) site and origin of transfer (oriT) of RP4. One pair of expression vectors, pARO180 and pARO190, retains the beta-lactamase (bla) gene and twelve of the 13 restriction enzyme multiple cloning sites (MCS) of pUC18/19. Another pair was created by replacing the bla gene with the gene encoding kanamycin resistance (kan) from Tn5. The molecules replicate to high copy number in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. They can be transferred efficiently to other Gram- bacteria from the mobilizing strain, E. coli S17-1. In non-enteric strains, the new plasmids can be used as suicide vectors in site-specific insertional mutagenesis.
TI  - [Susceptibility and R plasmids conjugation tests for 44 strains of gram negative  bacilli in a burn unit].
AB  - 44 strains of 9 species Gram negative bacilli were isolated and identified in a burn unit, among them 25 strains were from patients and 19 from ward environment. All strains were tested for susceptibility to antibiotics and R plasmids. Using both agar dilution and disc diffusion methods to test susceptibility to 12 kinds of antibiotics, namely, Streptomycin Chloramphenicol, Tetracycline, Ampicillin, Kanamycin, Gentamycin, Nalidixic acid, Amikacin Rifampin, Carbenicillin, Cefazolin and Polymyxin, we found that all 44 strains were susceptible to Rifampin and Polymyxin. To the other 10 kinds of antibiotics, the susceptibilities varied. 40 strains of bacteria (91%) were resistant to 3 kinds or more of antibiotics, i.e, multiple resistant bacteria, 2 strains resistant to 2 kinds of antibiotics (4.6%), and 2 strains susceptible to all 12 kinds of antibiotics (4.6%). The multiple resistant strains consisted of 9 strains (22.5%) of R plasmid-harboured bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 strains, Citrobacter 4 strains, Proteins 1 strain, Enterobacter aerogenes 1 strain and Escherichia coli 1 strain. All the R plasmids carried the marks of resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, kanamycin, gentamycin, streptomycin, and carbenicillin, but no one carried marks of resistance to Cefazolin and Amikacin indicating that drug-resistance of the last two antibiotics might not be mediated by R plasmids. Two strains of Citrobacter freundii isolated from 2 patients and showing susceptibility to all antibiotics were induced to be Rifampin-resistance (Rif) strains without changing their original biological characters. They both could receive the R plasmids of the multiple resistance strains one from patient and the other from ward environment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Identification and classification of 204 strains of gram negative organisms isolated from poultry eggs].
AB  - Results of identification and classification of 204 strains of Gram negative bacteria isolated from poultry eggs are reported. Among 106 strains of glucose nonfermenting bacteria 105 (99%) strains could be further identified as: pseudomonas (87 strains), including P. fluorescens (63), P. putida (9), P. maltophilia (12), P. putrefaciens (2), and P. stutzeri (1); 2 strains of Alcaligenes, both identified as A. denitrificans; 7 strains of Flavobacterium, including F. multovorum (3) and Flavobacterium sp. (4); and 9 strains of Acinetobacter, including A. lwoffi (7) and A. anitratus (2). Among 98 strains of fermentors, 73 strains (74.5%) could be identified as; Escherichia (9), E. coli (12), Enterobacter Liquefaciens (31), Ent. cloacae (7), Ent. halfnia (8), Ent. aerogenes (1) and proteus (5); while 25 strains (25.5%) which split glucose and lactose or sucrose fermentative with acid but no gaseouse formation remain to be ascertained.
TI  - Ammonia-induced cell envelope injury in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - Ammonia-induced cell envelope injury was examined in pure cultures of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. Cell injury, as determined by the ratio of colony-forming units on m-T7 agar to colony-forming units on m-Endo agar, increased with exposure to increasing concentrations of ammonia. Cell envelopes appeared to be the site of injury as indicated by increasing susceptibility to lysozyme with increasing ammonia concentration. Cells exposed to ammonia also exhibited more cellular leakage than control cells. Leakage from cells exposed to ammonia included proteins, and all leaked substances increased in concentration as ammonia concentrations increased. The concentration of 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO) in the outer membrane of E. coli increased with ammonia exposure, while KDO concentration in the outer membrane of E. aerogenes decreased. The results suggest that exposure of E. coli cells to high concentrations of ammonia disrupts the outer membrane and lipopolysaccharide-associated proteins, while E. aerogenes cells are affected through the disruption of bonds between KDO and the outer membrane.
TI  - Cloning of aldB, which encodes alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase, an exoenzyme from Bacillus brevis.
AB  - A gene for alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC) was cloned from Bacillus brevis in Escherichia coli and in Bacillus subtilis. The 1.3-kilobase-pair nucleotide sequence of the gene, aldB, encoding ALDC and its flanking regions was determined. An open reading frame of 285 amino acids included a typical N-terminal signal peptide of 24 or 27 amino acids. A B. subtilis strain harboring the aldB gene on a recombinant plasmid processed and secreted ALDC. In contrast, a similar enzyme from Enterobacter aerogenes is intracellular.
TI  - The sequence of the malG gene from Salmonella typhimurium and its functional implications.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the malG gene which is essential for maltose transport was determined in Salmonella typhimurium and compared to homologous genes from Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. malG genes from S. typhimurium and E. aerogenes were expressed and their products were active in E. coli. The primary structure of the three MalG proteins was highly conserved. Changes were mainly clustered in a relatively large hydrophilic region of the protein (residues 40 to 75). In contrast, other hydrophilic segments were more conserved, and most remaining changes occurred in the hydrophobic putative transmembrane segments. This suggests that hydrophilic loops in this inner membrane protein may be functionally constrained. These results prove new insights into the functional sites in MalG.
TI  - Crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of five  broad-spectrum cephalosporins in the elderly.
AB  - To better define the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) of the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins in the elderly, we administered single 2-g intravenous infusions of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and ceftizoxime to six healthy volunteers over the age of 65 years. Serum was collected over 24 h, and concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography; pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for each drug. SBA was measured against representative strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All agents tested had excellent SBAs against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, often for a longer duration than would be expected on the basis of conventional dosing regimens. Ceftazidime had the greatest SBA against E. aerogenes and was the only agent with a substantial SBA against P. aeruginosa. Although ceftizoxime had the greatest SBA against S. aureus, none of these cephalosporins had substantial antistaphylococcal SBAs. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that cefoperazone and ceftriaxone had markedly different concentration-time profiles in the elderly volunteers than would have been expected on the basis of existing data from younger volunteers. For older patients, dosing guidelines for these two agents may need to be altered.
TI  - Subgingival occurrence of enteric rods, yeasts and staphylococci after systemic doxycycline therapy.
AB  - The occurrence of subgingival enteric rods, yeasts and staphylococci (pre-treatment and post-treatment) was examined in 21 adult periodontitis patients receiving mechanical periodontal therapy and systemic doxycycline (200 mg on first day, then 100 mg/day for 20 days). Subgingival samples obtained prior to, and 2 weeks and 4 weeks after completion of the antibiotic therapy were transported in VMGA III and plated onto TSBV (for enteric rods and yeasts) and Staphylococcus 110 media. At baseline, small numbers of enteric rods (3 patients), yeasts (5 patients) and staphylococci (11 patients) were detected subgingivally. After the antibiotic therapy, more than 10-fold increases were seen in subgingival numbers of Enterobacter aerogenes (2 patients), Escherichia coli (1 patient), Candida albicans (2 patients), and staphylococci (11 patients). These findings demonstrating that systemic doxycycline therapy may result in at least temporary subgingival overgrowths of enteric rods, yeasts and staphylococci, may indicate the risk of frequent use of tetracycline in periodontal therapy.
TI  - Comparison of enrichment and plating media for isolation of Yersinia.
AB  - Yersinia enterocolitica (Serotypes 0:3 or 0:8), Yersinia frederiksenii, Yersinia  kristensenii, or Yersinia intermedia along with 10(8) cells of each of three extraneous organisms (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas fragi), all commonly found on market poultry, were inoculated into five enrichment media followed by streaking onto 11 plating media to determine the most-efficacious combinations for future surveys or assessment studies. For Yersinia enterocolitica (0:8), infrequent recoveries were made using yeast extract-rosebengal-bile oxalate sorbose broth and phosphate-buffered saline (4 C) followed by plating onto pectin, DNase-Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate)-sorbitol, MacConkey-Tween 80, or cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (CIN) agars. With Y. enterocolitica (0:3), recoveries were most frequently made using phosphate-buffered saline, sorbitol bile (incubated for 17 days) and yeast extract-rosebengal-bile oxalate sorbose broth followed by plating onto pectin, CIN, bismuth sulfite (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI), or modified Rimler-Shotts agar. For Y. frederiksenii, Y. kristensenii, and Y. intermedia, incubation in sorbitol bile for 17 days or in yeast extract-rosebengal-bile oxalate sorbose broth, followed by plating onto CIN, pectin, DNase-Tween/80-sorbitol, cellobiose-arginine-lysine agar, or MacConkey-Tween 80 agar yielded the most-frequent recoveries. Overall, the CIN and pectin agars performed best for the recovery of the Yersinia bacterium; the modified selenite broth and the bismuth-sulfite plating agars were unsatisfactory in the present study.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of TEM-3 (CTX-1) beta-lactamase.
AB  - A total of 33 clinical isolates encoding TEM-3 (CTX-1) from four French hospitals were studied. The strains belonged to seven species, Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 24), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens (n = 2), Citrobacter freundii (n = 1), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), and Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1). All the strains harbored an Inc7 or M self-transferable plasmid with a size of approximately 85 kilobases. The plasmids had closely related EcoRI, HincII, HindIII, and PvuII restriction endonuclease-generated patterns and conferred resistance to all beta-lactams, except cephamycins and imipenem; to tetracycline, because of the presence of the genes blatem-3 and tetC, respectively, as determined by hybridization with specific probes; and to sulfonamide. Depending on the presence or absence and level of expression of the genes aacA4, aadA, and dfrI and of insertion element IS15, four types of plasmids could be distinguished. Plasmid pCFF04, the prototype plasmid encoding TEM-3, was widespread and appeared, by Southern hybridization, as the progenitor of the other types of replicons. The plasmid epidemic responsible for dissemination of TEM-3 in clinical isolates of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae may have originated in S. marcescens since pCFF04 was first detected in this species.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the Enterobacter aerogenes signal peptidase II (lsp) gene.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, prolipoprotein signal peptidase is encoded by the lsp gene,  which is organized into an operon consisting of ileS, lsp, and three open reading frames, designated genes x, orf-149, and orf-316. The Enterobacter aerogenes lsp gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The nucleotide sequence of the Enterobacter aerogenes lsp gene and a part of its flanking sequences were determined. A high degree of homology was found between the E. coli ileS-lsp operon and the corresponding genes in Enterobacter aerogenes. Furthermore, the same five genes which constitute an operon in E. coli were found in Enterobacter aerogenes in the same order.
TI  - New screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  - During routine membrane filter (MF) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor colony sheen and metallic sheen on the MF surface with mEndo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. To study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for MF quality, we compared five different MFs with various types and degrees of defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. Results showed that the Enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more MF defects than any other combination did and was superior to the Escherichia coli-mFC agar American Society for Testing and Materials method for grid line inhibition. Filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. Poor colony sheen and sheen on the MF surface were best detected with Enterobacter aerogenes on mEndo agar. The use of tryptic soy agar and mEndo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of MF irregularities. Of the 142 MF lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. This method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size MFs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.
TI  - Ammonia-induced injury in pure cultures and natural populations of coliform bacteria.
AB  - Ammonia-induced injury was investigated in pure cultures of Escherichia coli and  Enterobacter aerogenes, and in natural coliform populations obtained from the oligotrophic Luxapallila and the eutrophic Sunflower Rivers in northern Mississippi. Pure cultures were affected by ammonia exposure as indicated by changes in the injury ratio (IR) of CFU on m-T7 agar/CFU on m-Endo agar. Ammonia concentrations between 0 and 20 (mg NH3-N/1) had little or no effect and concentrations between 40 and 80 caused the greatest injury. Natural coliform populations from the oligotrophic river were more prone to ammonia-induced injury than those from the eutrophic river. The results stress the need for the routine use of m-T7 media and the enumeration of injured cells when using the membrane filter procedure to ascertain domestic water quality.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. None of the compounds was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. Cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of Enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of S. epidermidis strains. In biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. It did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. Adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with Esch. coli. This observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.
TI  - High efficiency transduction of single strand plasmid DNA into enteric bacteria.
AB  - This report demonstrates high efficiency transduction of enteric bacteria using single strand plasmids packaged in M13 phage capsids. Transformation by plasmid DNA is usually a very inefficient process in many enteric bacteria other than Escherichia coli K12. Plasmids carrying an M13 origin of replication can be replicated and packaged when cells carrying such plasmids are infected with M13 or a derivative helper phage. By introducing an F' plasmid into E. coli, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes, these species can now be infected at high efficiency with M13 phage and with packaged single strand plasmids, yielding an efficient method to introduce cloned DNA fragments into these bacteria. The titer of colony forming units in a lysate was essentially equivalent in all the bacteria, demonstrating an equal efficiency of transduction of these other enteric bacteria compared to E. coli.
TI  - Comparison of sequences from the malB regions of Salmonella typhimurium and Enterobacter aerogenes with Escherichia coli K12: a potential new regulatory site in the interoperonic region.
AB  - The malE and malK genes from Salmonella typhimurium, and the malEFG operon and a  portion of malK from Enterobacter aerogenes were cloned and sequenced. Plasmid-borne malE genes from both species and the malF and malG genes from E. aerogenes were expressed normally in Escherichia coli, and their products function in maltose transport. This shows that the malB products from the three species are interchangeable, at least in the combinations tested. The general genetic organization of the malB region is conserved. Potential binding sites and distances between them are highly conserved in the regulatory intervals. An unexpected conserved region was detected, which we call the U box, and which could be another target for a regulatory protein. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of the U box in the regulatory region of the pulA-malX operon in Klebsiella pneumoniae. The intergenic region between malE and malF from S. typhimurium and E. aerogenes, contains inverted repeats similar to the palindromic units (PU or REP) found at the same location in E. coli. The predicted amino acid sequence of the encoded proteins showed 90% or more identity in every pairwise comparison of species.
TI  - Resistance studies with ofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antibacterial activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074/005), a new oral cephalosporin, and eight other oral antimicrobials.
TI  - Prevention of clinical coliform mastitis in dairy cows by a mutant Escherichia coli vaccine.
AB  - A prospective cohort study was undertaken in two commercial California dairies. The treatment group, 246 cows, received three doses of a whole cell bacterin of J5 Escherichia coli (mutant of E. coli O111:B4) plus Freund's incomplete adjuvant vaccine (two in the dry period and one after calving) while 240 unvaccinated cows served as controls. Thirty-five cases of clinical coliform mastitis were diagnosed, six in vaccinated cows and 29 in unvaccinated cows. Bacteria isolated from the clinical cases included 15 E. coli five Klebsiella pneumoniae, three K. oxytoca, three K. ozaenae, five Enterobacter aerogenes, three Serratia marcescens and one Serratia spp. Four control cows were culled, three of them because of chronic coliform mastitis and one because of postcoliform infection agalactia. Incidence rate of clinical gram-negative mastitis was 2.57% in vaccinated cows and 12.77% in unvaccinated cows. The estimated risk ratio, the measure of risk of having clinical gram-negative mastitis for vaccinated cows to unvaccinated cows, was 0.20 (p less than 0.005), indicating a strong relationship between vaccination and lack of clinical gram-negative mastitis. The results of this trial indicate that the administration of the E. coli J5 vaccine is protective against natural challenge to gram-negative bacteria, and reduces the incidence of clinical gram-negative mastitis in dairy cows during the first three months of lactation.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of intravenous catheter materials in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Four different intravenous catheter materials, brands Teflon, Silastic, Vialon, and Tecoflex, were evaluated in vitro for bacterial adherence after 2 and 24 hours' incubation in trypticase soy broth and after 2 hours' incubation in nutrient-free phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The organisms used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The significant differences in in vitro adherence of the different bacterial species to the various catheters were then evaluated in vivo by intravenous injection of a single bolus of 1 X 10(5) organisms via tail vein of rats with previously placed catheters in their superior venae cavae. There was no association between the in vitro bacterial adherence and the tendency of the in vivo catheters to become colonized. Results of scanning electron microscopy of clean catheters and those removed from the rats showed obvious differences in surface characteristics and in clot adhesion between the catheters. These characteristics did not correlate with bacterial adherence in vitro or colonization in vivo. It is concluded that laboratory studies of bacterial adherence to, physical characteristics of, and thrombogenicity of intravenous catheters do not necessarily translate into resistance to clinical catheter sepsis.
TI  - "Spontaneous" pneumocephalus associated with aerobic bacteremia.
AB  - Three cases of "spontaneous" pneumocephalus suspected to have resulted from aerobic bacteremia caused by Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella aerogenes are reported. In two cases, the E. cloacae and K. aerogenes were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. These cases were characterized by a rapid accumulation of air, without niveau, in the subarachnoid space and ventricles.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (AZT) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacteria were determined using MIC-2000 plus system. Bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in Saga Medical School during a period from May 1987 to March 1988. Summarized results were as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and MIC80 values of AZT against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. 3. The MIC50 and MIC80 of AZT against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. AZT did not show any antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Urinary tract infection.
AB  - Over two years, 9892 mid-stream urine samples from patients attending the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi were cultured. Significant bacterial growth was seen in 23.5% samples. Further identification of these organisms revealed 40% of E. coli, 16% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11% Klebsiella aerogenes, 5.0% Enterobacter sp., 13% Proteus sp., 4.0% Serratia liquifaciens, 1.0% Acinetobacter sp., 3.0% Citrobacter sp., 4.0% Enterococci, 0.5% Staphylococcus aureus. Results of sensitivity tests performed with antibiotics Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole, Nitrofurantoin, Nalidixic acid, Gentamicin, Amikacin, Pipemedic acid, Cefotaxime, Azactam and Carbenicillin did not reveal any distinct pattern.
TI  - Evolution of chemotactic-signal transducers in enteric bacteria.
AB  - The methyl-accepting chemotactic-signal transducers of the enteric bacteria are transmembrane proteins that consist of a periplasmic receptor domain and a cytoplasmic signaling domain. To study their evolution, transducer genes from Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae were compared with transducer genes from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. There are at least two functional transducer genes in the nonmotile species K. pneumoniae, one of which complements the defect in serine taxis of an E. coli tsr mutant. The tse (taxis to serine) gene of E. aerogenes also complements an E. coli tsr mutant; the tas (taxis to aspartate) gene of E. aerogenes complements the defect in aspartate taxis, but not the defect in maltose taxis, of an E. coli tar mutant. The sequence was determined for 5 kilobases of E. aerogenes DNA containing a 3' fragment of the cheA gene, cheW, tse, tas, and a 5' fragment of the cheR gene. The tse and tas genes are in one operon, unlike tsr and tar. The cytoplasmic domains of Tse and Tas are very similar to those of E. coli and S. typhimurium transducers. The periplasmic domain of Tse is homologous to that of Tsr, but Tas and Tar are much less similar in this region. However, several short sequences are conserved in the periplasmic domains of Tsr, Tar, Tse, and Tas but not of Tap and Trg, transducers that do not bind amino acids. These conserved regions include residues implicated in amino-acid binding.
TI  - Microbiological quality and public health significance of ice-cream.
AB  - Fifty samples of ice-cream were subjected to microbiological examination. Of these 72% had total viable count over 10(6)/g while 66% had coliform count between 10(2)-10(3)/g. The micro-organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (46%), Enterobacter aerogenes (34%), Staphylococcus aureus (26%), proteus species (16%), Streptococcus faecalis (12%), Citrobacter species (10%) and Bacillus cereus (4%). The results showed that commercially prepared ice-cream sold in the market was not satisfactory for human consumption and preventive measures should be enforced for the supply of satisfactory products.
TI  - [Clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - During 8 months from October 1986 to May 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.
TI  - Detection of antigens from gram-negative bacilli in urine of children with urinary tract infections. II. Thermostable bacterial proteins.
AB  - An enzyme immunoassay for detection of bacterial antigens in urine specimens from urinary tract infections (UTI) was developed. The antigens detected in infections by Enterobacteriaceae: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus sp. were different from the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA). They were digested by trypsin and were characterized by remarkable thermostability; their molecular weights were approximately 34,000 and 31,000. They were detected by means of antisera to ECA or to suspension of E. coli. The frequency of positive results with urine specimens from enterobacterial UTI was 87-99%. In contrast, the urine specimens of UTI by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were positive in fewer than 20% with anti-E. coli sera, but were positive in more than 85% in tests with antiserum to P. aeruginosa. The possible diagnostic application of the described tests was discussed.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  - In vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. A microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). The following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: Staphylococcus aureus, S intermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Ent cloacae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus sp, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, Proteus vulgaris, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included S aureus, S intermedius, Ent aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Pasteurella multocida, B bronchiseptica, Pr mirabilis, and Serratia sp.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of monobactams against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (CRMN) and aztreonam (AZT] against Gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (PC: piperacillin (PIPC], cephems (CEPs: ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefsulodin (CFS], carbapenem (imipenem (IPM] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (NFLX) and ofloxacin (OFLX] as reference antibiotics. A total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, were used as test strains. 1. CRMN and AZT, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., M. morganii, P. rettgeri or H. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of S. marcescens. On the other hand, isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. Among these cases, whereas R strains, i.e. resistant strains showing MICs greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to PC and CEPs, I strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing MICs between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. Strains resistant to PIPC, a PC, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. Antibacterial activities of CEPs varied against different bacterial species. While strains resistant to CTX, CAZ and LMOX were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and S. marcescens, large percentages of LMOX-resistant strains of C. freundii and Enterobacter spp. were of the I type. CTX-resistant strains were also found among isolates of P. vulgaris and M. morganii. Proportions of CEP-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were 28% for CFS and 12% for CAZ. 4. No or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to IPM, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and CEPs against Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis and H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  - Sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) is a preparation containing CPZ and SBT, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. The antimicrobial activity of SBT/CPZ was stronger than that of CPZ alone. This increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of SBT was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and MIC values. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of CPZ alone was 50 micrograms/ml. MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of CPZ, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of CPZ alone, and MIC80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which contained 30 micrograms of CPZ and 30 micrograms of SBT. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate MIC values. To interpret results of the Showa SBT/CPZ disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs. However, if different break points against P. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of MICs. Antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated strains to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of aztreonam (AZT) and cephems against clinically isolated 334 strains were investigated. The results obtained in the study are summarized as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated 334 strains. 2. AZT showed potent activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Enterobacter aerogenes and Citrobacter freundii. 3. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior against Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to those of cephems.
TI  - Divergence of the aerobactin iron uptake systems encoded by plasmids pColV-K30 in Escherichia coli K-12 and pSMN1 in Aerobacter aerogenes 62-1.
AB  - Although the aerobactin-mediated iron uptake system has been characterized genetically in Escherichia coli, the siderophore aerobactin was chemically characterized after purification from culture supernatants of Aerobacter aerogenes 62-1, a member of the Klebsielleae. We have cloned and mapped the genes encoding the aerobactin system genes of A. aerogenes 62-1 and begun characterization of the relevant proteins and enzymatic activities of this plasmid-mediated aerobactin system. Published chemical data indicate that the siderophore aerobactin of E. coli is the same molecule as the aerobactin of Aerobacter aerogenes 62-1, but we have found that both the genes and the complement of proteins making up the biosynthetic enzymes in the two systems have diverged. In contrast, the outer membrane receptors for ferric aerobactin of the two systems showed immunologic cross-reactivity, were of the same molecular size (74 kilodaltons), and were encoded by homologous DNA sequences.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefuzonam. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of cefuzonam (CZON) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MIC's and the results of disc susceptibility test. The MIC's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)CFU/ml. The MIC80's of CZON against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae and Citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The MIC80's against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC80's against Staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Approximately 70% of strains of S. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. For the interpretation of the CZON Showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa disc containing CZON, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC less than 60 micrograms/ml. Reliability of the CZON disc tests in estimating approximate MIC values was studied using Showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms CZON. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MIC's, showing the reliability of the disc method. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups except those against P. aeruginosa. Some strains of P. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with MIC's against these organisms. As CZON is not effective against P. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between MIC's and the disc test would result when P. aeruginosa was excluded. With Showa 30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, it was demonstrated that differentiation of strains with MIC's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of CZON were used. According to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
AB  - Reliability of the cefamandole (CMD) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CMD). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CMD disc tests, which is normally used in Japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. The results obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CMD disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. Only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. In this study, approximately 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by CMD at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to CMD at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. CMD was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. About 90% of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml CMD of highly methicillin-resistant strains (MIC greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of S. aureus were examined. Ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to CMD, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. Imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. Minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of an oral iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, R-3746.
AB  - The in vitro activity of R-3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a CH2OCH3 moiety at position 3, was compared with those of other antibiotics. R-3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, F, and G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0.06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2- to 8-fold more active than cefixime, and 16- to 64-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. Ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against Branhamella spp. It did not inhibit (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of R-3746 for 90% of strains tested for Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter diversus; Proteus mirabilis; and Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. R-3746 inhibited 50% of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella spp., Providencia spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas spp. were resistant. Fifty percent of Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but MICs for Bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. R-3746 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by most chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of E1040, a new cephalosporin with potent antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - E1040 is a new parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum and potent antipseudomonal activity. The compound was four- to eightfold more active than ceftazidime and cefsulodin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC of E1040 for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 3.13 micrograms/ml). E1040 also showed a potent activity against other glucose-nonfermentative rods, including Acinetobacter species. The activities of E1040 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae were roughly comparable to the activities of ceftazidime and cefmenoxime and exceeded that of cefotiam. Against Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 0.78 micrograms/ml), Enterobacter cloacae (MIC90, 3.13 micrograms/ml), and Enterobacter aerogenes (MIC90, 0.2 micrograms/ml), E1040 was 16- to 256-fold more active than ceftazidime and cefmenoxime. The activities of E1040 against gram-positive cocci and anaerobes were comparable to those of ceftazidime, but the compound was less active than cefmenoxime. E1040 was at least as resistant as ceftazidime and cefmenoxime to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases and showed high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Activity of 9 beta-lactam antibiotics combined with clavulanic acid or sulbactam against the strains of broad-spectrum beta-lactamase (CTX-1) producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated at the Henri Mondor Hospital].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of seven cephalosporins: cefotaxime (CTX), ceftriaxone (CRO), ceftazidime (CAZ), latamoxef (MOX), cefoxitin (FOX), cefotetan (CTT) and CM 40876 (CM), of aztreonam (ATM) and imipenem (IPM) were evaluated by agar dilution with and without 5 mg/l of clavulanic acid (AC) or sulbactam (SB) for 28 strains isolated in 1986 (15 K. pneumoniae, 3. K. oxytoca, 4 E. coli, 4 E. cloacae, 1 E. aerogenes and 1 C. freundii). Comparatively to MICs of sensitive strains and to those of cured variants, MICs of these strains were very increased for CTX, CRO, ATM (mode MIC: 1 mg/l), and CAZ (2); weakly increased for MOX and CTT (0.25), and identical for IMP (0.12-0.25), CM (0.06) and FOX (2-4), except for Enterobacter and Citrobacter (64). Association with AC or SB did not modify MICs of FOX, CM and IMP. For the other antibiotics, MICs were reduced by addition of AC: Klebsiella: 5 log2 for CTX and CRO, 4 for CAZ and ATM, 2 for MOX and CTT; E. coli: 4 log2 for CTX and ATM, 3 for CRO and CAZ, 1 for MOX and CTT; Enterobacter and Citrobacter 2 log2 for CTX, CRO, CAZ and ATM, 1 for MOX and CTT. With SB, decrease of MICs was two to for fold lesser than with AC. AC, and less efficiently SB, restored activity of CTX, CRO, CAZ and ATM on CTX-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Klebsiella and E. coli. It was the same for MOX and CTT, weakly affected by this resistance. AC and SB had not effect on FOX, CM and IPM which remained active on these strains.
TI  - Lipid A precursor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate.
AB  - Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) caused accumulation of a lipid A precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid A of mature LPS. The enzyme CTP:CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (CMP-KDO synthetase) from P. aeruginosa is inhibited by the KDO analog alpha-C-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-D-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (I), and I is effectively delivered to P. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. Intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (I) which then inhibits activation of KDO by CMP-KDO synthetase causing accumulation of lipid A precursor and subsequent growth stasis. The major lipid A precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, C12:O, 2OH-C12:O and 3OH-C10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3OH-C12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. Analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (M - H)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid A from P. aeruginosa. In contrast, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid A precursors which only contained 3-OH-C14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. This difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid A are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  - Tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. At less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. At less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited Haemophilus spp., Neisseria spp., and Branhamella catarrhalis. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas spp. or Acinetobacter spp. Tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family Enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. Some Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. The MIC for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, and C and for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for 90% of enterococci, Listeria spp., Bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as TEM-1 and SHV-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Enterobacter, Morganella, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides spp. Tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. The growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the MICs and MBCs.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and expression of the Enterobacter aerogenes alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase gene in brewer's yeast.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 1.4-kilobase DNA fragment containing the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase gene of Enterobacter aerogenes was determined. The sequence contains an entire protein-coding region of 780 nucleotides which encodes an alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase of 260 amino acids. The DNA sequence coding for alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase was placed under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase I promoter of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a plasmid capable of autonomous replication in both S. cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. Brewer's yeast cells transformed by this plasmid showed alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase activity and were used in laboratory-scale fermentation experiments. These experiments revealed that the diacetyl concentration in wort fermented by the plasmid-containing yeast strain was significantly lower than that in wort fermented by the parental strain. These results indicated that the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase activity produced by brewer's yeast cells degraded alpha-acetolactate and that this degradation caused a decrease in diacetyl production.
TI  - Activity of cefixime (FK 027) for resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Cefixime is an orally absorbable cephalosporin with an extended spectrum of in vitro activity for gram-negative bacteria especially members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Gram-negative rod isolates collected over a three month period were tested against cefixime. Greater than 99% of Escherichia coli isolates was susceptible to cefixime including those resistant to ampicillin. Similarly isolates of Klebsiella, Proteus and Providencia were also exquisitely susceptible to cefixime as were 91% of Enterobacter cloacae and 71% of Enterobacter aerogenes. Killing kinetics of cefixime did not differ from that of the intravenously administered third-generation cephalosporin, cefotaxime. The addition of magnesium and calcium divalent cations or the lowering of the pH to 5.0 did not affect the action of this antibiotic. The extended spectrum of this oral antibiotic may be useful in treatment of urinary tract and skin and soft tissue infections caused by the more resistant gram-negative rods.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Absence of a role for lytic microorganisms in the decline of bacteria andSaccharomyces introduced into soil.
AB  - The populations ofKlebsieila pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, andPseudomonas sp. fell following their addition to soil, but species lysing these gram-negative bacteria were not detected. The numbers ofStaphylococcus aureus andMicrococcus flavus fell by more than four orders of magnitude and ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae by more than two orders after their addition to soil. Organisms lysing these gram-positive bacteria were present in soil, but their numbers did not increase as a result of the additions. Lytic activity againstS. aureus was detected in soil filtrates, but this activity was not enhanced by inoculation of soil with the bacterium. Addition of cycloheximide to soil suspensions delayed the fall in abundance ofM. flavus but did not suppress the lytic populations. We conclude that lysis is not responsible for the decline of bacteria orS. cerevisiae added to soil.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefadroxil, and the interpretation of disc-susceptibility testing.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefadroxil were determined for 749 defined clinically-significant bacteria isolated in a London teaching hospital and for 63 strains from an international collection of Gram-negative bacilli. Assuming a breakpoint of 16 mg/l, for the hospital isolates 81.8% of Gram-negative bacilli and 83.4% of Gram-positive cocci were sensitive. No significant difference between in-patient, out-patient or community-acquired isolates was found. Ninety-five and a half per cent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes (including gentamicin-resistant strains), Proteus mirabilis, and (with the exception of Streptococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) all Gram-positive cocci were sensitive. Of 41 strains of Enterobacter spp., were resistant. Most indole-positive Proteus, and all Serratia and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant, including 36 additional strains taken from an international collection. Of 30 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, only six had MICs of 16 mg/l or less. For disc susceptibility testing, the standard disc containing 30 micrograms of cefadroxil reliably gave zones of greater than 17 mm for organisms with MICs of less than 16 mg/l. A zone of less than 14 mm corresponded to MICs of greater than 64 mg/l. Despite a lack of controlled clinical trials, the results of this study (taken with favourable pharmacokinetics) suggest that cefadroxil has potential as an oral cephalosporin in hospital practice in the U.K.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. Current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. Since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. The in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMTC) were investigated. Both DDTC and DMTC were effective against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). By agar diffusion, DDTC at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to 34 mm against MRSA. The DMTC produced slightly greater zone sizes against MRSA of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for DMTC against MRSA was 6 micrograms per ml. Both DDTC and DMTC were also effective against enterococci, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. The MICs of DMTC for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the MICs for Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. In addition, DMTC was synergistic with gentamicin against MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additive and synergistic effects of DMTC were displayed with gentamicin against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of elderly patients with complicated urinary  tract infections due to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The effectiveness and safety of ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, were prospectively evaluated in the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections caused by gram-negative organisms resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Twenty-five elderly (mean age, 70.4 years) patients (24 men and one woman) were enrolled. Initial pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 isolates), Escherichia coli (five isolates), Enterobacter aerogenes (one isolate), Citrobacter freundii (one isolate), Serratia species (two isolates), Proteus vulgaris (one isolate), and enterococcus (one isolate). Patients received 500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally twice daily for one week (mean, 6.98 days). Results of urine cultures obtained during therapy were negative in all cases, and at one week post-therapy, 21 of 25 (84 percent) infections were cured. Four patients experienced a relapse with P. aeruginosa. Repeat urine culture specimens were obtained at four to six weeks from 14 patients who had cures at one week post-therapy, and seven continued to have cures. Three patients had late relapses with P. aeruginosa, E. coli, or Serratia marcescens, and four were reinfected with new strains. Five patients who received concomitant oral antacids had lower mean peak and trough serum ciprofloxacin levels than did patients not receiving antacids (p less than 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Mild adverse effects were seen in seven patients: eosinophilia (one patient), eosinophilia and reduced white blood cell count (one patient), crystalluria (one patient), granular casts (one patient), elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels (one patient), and nausea (two patients), but none warranted discontinuation of ciprofloxacin therapy. P. aeruginosa isolates from two patients who experienced a relapse showed increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations from 0.13 to 0.5 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, to ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics. Orally administered ciprofloxacin was a safe and effective therapy for complicated urinary tract infections in elderly patients.
TI  - Treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis with ciprofloxacin. Results of a one-year follow-up study.
AB  - In a one-year follow-up study, short-term therapy with ciprofloxacin proved to be beneficial in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis, particularly in cases of Escherichia coli prostatitis. Ciprofloxacin therapy of E. coli prostatitis was a complete success in five of 12 patients, a probable success in two, and in one patient the outcome cannot be judged. Ciprofloxacin treatment failed in three men, and therapy was discontinued in one patient because of side effects. Enterobacter aerogenes prostatitis was cured. Ciprofloxacin treatment was insufficient in three patients with Streptococcus faecalis prostatitis and in one patient with Pseudomonas aeruginosa prostatitis.
TI  - Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus, coliforms and antibiotic-resistant strains of Escherichia coli in rural water supplies in Port Harcourt.
AB  - The bacteriological quality of some rural water supplies in Port Harcourt was monitored over a 3 month period. The supplies were unsatisfactory as judged by standard plate counts (10(3)/ml) and the presence of presumptive and faecal coliforms and Staphylococcus aureus. The recovery of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) further substantiated the existence of health hazards. The most frequently isolated coliforms were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Coliform contamination was greater in well water than in river or stream water samples. An antibiotic sensitivity test revealed that 17.5-27.2% of E. coli strains were resistant to three or more antibiotics. Escherichia coli isolated from well water samples exhibited the greatest degree of multiple resistance. Some strains were resistant to all the six antibiotics tested. The danger of an epidemic of waterborne diseases in the communities as a result of drinking water from these non-potable sources is noted.
TI  - Use of tannic acid for the ultrastructural visualization of periplasm in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Tannic acid mordanting reveals the periplasm, the area between the outer membrane and the inner membrane of gram-negative bacteria, Rhizobium sp., Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes, as an electron-dense layer continuous with the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. The method involves 18 hr of tannic acid treatment after fixation in aldehyde prior to osmium tetroxide postfixation, followed by conventional electron microscopy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (BW  A509U).
AB  - The thymidine analog 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (BW A509U; azidothymidine [AZT])  had potent bactericidal activity against many members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, and Enterobacter aerogenes. AZT also had bactericidal activity against Vibrio cholerae and the fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. AZT had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, nontuberculosis mycobacteria, or most fungal pathogens. Several lines of evidence indicated that AZT must be activated to the nucleotide level to inhibit cellular metabolism: AZT was a substrate for E. coli thymidine kinase; spontaneously arising AZT-resistant mutants of E. coli ML-30 and S. typhimurium were deficient in thymidine kinase; and intact E. coli ML-30 cells converted [3H]AZT to its mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Of the phosphorylated metabolites, AZT-5'-triphosphate was the most potent inhibitor of replicative DNA synthesis in toluene-permeabilized E. coli pol A mutant cells. AZT-treated E. coli cultures grown in minimal medium contained highly elongated cells consistent with the inhibition of DNA synthesis. AZT-triphosphate was a specific DNA chain terminator in the in vitro DNA polymerization reaction catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. Thus, DNA chain termination may explain the lethal properties of this compound against susceptible microorganisms.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Biosynthesis of thiamin. Different biosynthetic routes of the thiazole moiety of  thiamin in aerobic organisms and anaerobic organisms.
AB  - The nitrogen atom of glycine was incorporated into the thiazole moiety of thiamin in the aerobic microorganisms Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mucor racemosus, Neurospora crassa, and Emericella nidulans. It was not incorporated in the case of the facultative anaerobic microorganisms Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes, which, however, did incorporate the nitrogen atom of tyrosine. These results show that aerobic microorganisms and facultative anaerobic microorganisms have different biosynthetic pathways for the thiazole moiety of thiamin.
TI  - Evolution of the enterobacterial sulA gene: a component of the SOS system encoding an inhibitor of cell division.
AB  - The LexA-regulated sulA (sfiA) gene of Escherichia coli encodes an unstable protein which inhibits cell division. By determining the nucleotide sequences of the corresponding genes from the related bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia marcescens it was found that the regulatory region and the LexA binding site (SOS box) have been better conserved during evolution than the coding sequence. The N terminus of the SulA protein [amino acid (aa) residues 1-30] has diverged extensively during the evolution of Enterobacteriaceae, whereas the central region (aa residues 31-149) has been well conserved. At the C terminus a sequence showing some homology to the N protein of phage lambda was detected that may represent a recognition site for the Lon protease, which is known to degrade both polypeptides. When expressed in E. coli, the foreign sulA genes did not block cell division suggesting that their products are inactive. This may indicate that the N terminus of the SulA protein is involved in recognizing the cell division apparatus.
TI  - Analysis of cell division gene ftsZ (sulB) from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The ftsZ (sulB) gene of Escherichia coli codes for a 40,000-dalton protein that carries out a key step in the cell division pathway. The presence of an ftsZ gene protein in other bacterial species was examined by a combination of Southern blot and Western blot analyses. Southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an E. coli ftsZ probe. Genomic DNA from more distantly related bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. Western blot analysis, with anti-E. coli FtsZ antiserum, revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. Several of the Enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the E. coli ftsZ gene. These transformed strains, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the FtsZ protein and to produce minicells. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled minicells revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. This demonstrated that the E. coli ftsZ gene could function in other bacterial species to induce minicells and that these minicells could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products.
TI  - The effect of the combination of erythromycin with new beta-lactam antibiotics against gram-negative aerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The effect of erythromycin on the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, cefmenoxime, aztreonam, imipenem, piperacillin, and gentamicin against 89 bacteria isolated from sputum and tracheal aspirates of patients admitted to intensive care units was evaluated. There were 30 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 5 Escherichia coli, 4 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 each of Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, 2 each of Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter anitratus; 1 Proteus mirabilis. All isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Organisms were screened for synergy by fixed erythromycin concentration at 1, 8 and 16 micrograms/ml. There were 16 isolates that showed a greater than four-fold difference in MICs. These strains were analyzed by the checkerboard broth method. No antagonism was seen for any drug combination with erythromycin. One Enterobacter cloacae showed synergy of ceftizoxime and erythromycin, and 1 E. cloacae showed synergy with cefotaxime. Addition was found for 2 P. aeruginosa, 1 each E. aerogenes, E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens. At concentrations of erythromycin achievable in blood or pulmonary tissue, the activity of newer beta-lactams and gentamicin is not altered by erythromycin.
TI  - Osteoarticular infections in children with sickle cell disease.
AB  - Thirteen children with sickle cell disease were identified as having 14 episodes  of osteoarticular infection in a review of 27 years' experience. There were eight episodes of osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis and six of suppurative arthritis alone. The etiologic agents in osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis were Salmonella sp in four cases, Escherichia coli in one, Enterobacter aerogenes in one, Staphylococcus aureus in one, and Haemophilus influenzae type b in one. Five of the cases with infection limited to the joint were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae; the sixth was caused by H influenzae type b. Fever (greater than or equal to 38.3 degrees C) was present in all children and the temperature was in excess of 39 degrees C in 62%. The mean duration of pain before admission was 4.5 days. The initial total white blood cell count ranged from 5,200 to 29,700/microL (mean 19,436/microL) and the total band neutrophil count ranged from 0 to 5,103/microL (mean 1,660/microL). The ESR was greater than 20 mm/h in eight of the ten patients who were tested. Management consisted of antibiotic therapy in all. Needle aspiration was performed in two patients with osteomyelitis and in three with suppurative arthritis. Incision and drainage was performed in two cases of osteomyelitis and in four with suppurative arthritis. The outcome was satisfactory in all except one patient who had several complications as a consequence of femoral neck osteomyelitis. Recurrence was reported in only one patient.
TI  - Evaluation of a commercial beta-glucuronidase test for the rapid and economical identification of Escherichia coli.
AB  - A commercial beta-glucuronidase (beta-GUR) test for the rapid and economical identification of Escherichia coli was evaluated. A total of 762 clinical strains and 228 environmental isolates were studied. More than 95% of the E. coli strains were found to be beta-GUR positive. Thirty-one clinical isolates of Shigella sonnei, 10 of Enterobacter cloacae, eight of Enterobacter aerogenes, nine of Citrobacter freundii and one of Salmonella enteritidis also gave positive results. The enzyme beta-GUR was also detected in two environmental strains of E. cloacae and one C. freundii. A comparative study between the beta-GUR test and the conventional identification system was carried out in 233 consecutive isolates of lactose positive enterobacteria. Agreement was observed in 223 cases and 190 E. coli strains were correctly identified using this test. Discrepancies were found in 10 cases: nine E. coli were beta-GUR negative and one C. freundii was beta-GUR positive. Escherichia coli was the only species positive for both beta-GUR and indole tests. This procedure permits a rapid, easy, precise and inexpensive identification of E. coli. beta-GUR positive Enterobacter strains have not previously been described.
TI  - Magnesium-dependent plaque formation by bacteriophage P1cinC(-) on Escherichia coli C and Shigella sonnei.
AB  - Phage P1C(-), in a state of the phage not infective to Escherichia coli K12, was  able to form plaques on a wild-type strain of E. coli C and on Shigella sonnei in the presence of Mg2+. Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and a Salmonella typhimurium galE mutant were not lysed by, but were lysogenized with P1cinC(-), whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus rettgeri, and S. typhimurium LT2 were not susceptible to either P1cinC(-) or P1cinC(+). The lipopolysaccharide structure of E. coli C and Sh. sonnei is discussed with reference to receptors for P1cinC(-) and P1cinC(+).
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - Sulbactam/ampicillin: in vitro spectrum, potency, and activity in models of acute infection.
AB  - More than 90% of community hospital-isolated strains of Staphylococcus (including methicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Branhamella, Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were inhibited by the sulbactam/ampicillin (1:2) combination at concentrations of 8 micrograms/16 micrograms per ml. The peak serum level from a 15-min infusion of 1 g/2 g of sulbactam/ampicillin is more than seven times this 90% end point. Excellent bactericidal activity was demonstrated against ampicillin-resistant isolates. Ampicillin-resistant strains did not develop resistance to sulbactam/ampicillin when they were serially transferred in the presence of sublethal concentrations of the combination. In mice the combination was active against a variety of acute, fatal infections produced by ampicillin-resistant bacterial isolates, including methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and mixed anaerobes. The in vitro and in vivo properties of sulbactam/ampicillin, coupled with its reliable pharmacokinetic performance, appear to make the combination ideally suited for the treatment of polymicrobial (aerobe-anaerobe) infections.
TI  - A study of some factors associated with wound infection.
AB  - Five hundred and four surgical patients were studied at Princess Basma Hospital,  North Jordan, during the period April 1984-January 1985. The overall postoperative wound infection rate was 3.6%. In clean surgery 1.1% of wounds were infected and in potentially contaminated and contaminated surgery the infection rate was 3.3% and 18.5% respectively. Major organisms isolated from infected wounds were Staphylococcus aureus (55.5%), Escherichia coli (16.6%), Proteus vulgaris (11.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes and Aeromonas hydrophilia, each with 5.6%. Use of a wound drain, duration of operation and carriage of Staph. aureus by the patient were associated with a higher frequency of wound infection.
TI  - A study of the skin flora of spinal cord injured patients.
AB  - The skin flora of 11 spinally-injured patients was compared to that of 11 healthy control subjects. The perinea, groins, penile shafts and urethras of the patients were heavily colonized by a range of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Observations on patients from admission for up to 25 days suggest that the Gram-negative bacilli start to colonize the skin 2-3 days after admission. Some species, e.g., Citrobacter diversus and Escherichia coli appear as transient organisms while others such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae seem to become stable skin residents. The relationship of the skin flora to the organisms causing urinary tract infections in these patients was studied.
TI  - Bacteria and helminth isolates from bile and faeces of zebu cattle slaughtered for human consumption in the Niger Delta areas of Nigeria.
AB  - Random bacteriological examination of 300 bile samples aseptically drawn from the gallbladders of adult cattle at slaughter revealed the presence of Escherichia coli in 30%, Enterobacter aerogenes in 14% and Klebsiella aerogenes in 56%. Bacteriological examination of another 116 faecal samples revealed Esch. coli in 60% and Ent. aerogenes in 40%, while parasitological examination revealed 50-100 strongyle ova per gram from pre-rain samples of faeces, 100-850 strongyle eggs per gram for faeces collected during the rains, and less than 50 strongyle eggs per gram for dry season faeces. No salmonellae were recovered from either the faeces or bile, and no Clostridium or any helminth of significant public health interest were recovered from faeces but it is still suggested that indirect consumption of bile and faeces from these animals may constitute a public health hazard.
TI  - Novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae from Ohio.
AB  - Epidemiologic studies of plasmid-mediated resistance at the Cleveland Veterans Administration Medical Center revealed that related plasmids had disseminated among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. We studied the beta-lactamases encoded by these plasmids in Escherichia coli C600 transformants or transconjugants. Substrate and inhibition profiles of the enzymes determined by two of these plasmids suggested an activity resembling TEM-1; however, isoelectric focusing revealed a pI of 7.0. These two plasmids were originally found in a Serratia marcescens (pDS076) and an Enterobacter cloacae (pDS075) strain isolated from the same sink in the medical intensive care unit and later, in an Enterobacter cloacae (pDS142 identical to pDS076) isolate colonizing a patient in the same unit. The plasmids also carried the aminoglycoside resistance determinant, 2"-aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferase. A 2-kilobase AvaI restriction endonuclease digestion fragment of pSD075 known to carry the beta-lactamase determinant was used as a molecular probe. This probe did not recognize sequences of any plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase tested including the recently described determinants ROB-1, TLE-1, and OXA-4-7. A TEM-1 probe derived from the 0.7-kilobase PstI-EcoRI fragment of pBR322 failed to recognize the new beta-lactamase gene. Four additional Enterobacter cloacae and two Enterobacter aerogenes strains isolated in Columbus, Ohio, have been shown to produce a pI 7.0 beta-lactamase and to carry plasmids recognized by the 2-kilobase probe. These data suggest dissemination of a novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Ohio and demonstrate the development and utility of a molecular probe for the new determinant. We suggest that the novel beta-lactamase be named OHIO-1.
TI  - [Enterotoxigenic capacity of strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter genera isolated in acute intestinal diseases in children].
AB  - 234 strains, including 104 K. pneumoniae strains, 28 K. oxytoxica strains, 64 E.  cloacae strains and 40 E. aerogenes strains, have been isolated from the intestine of 266 children with diarrhea, aged up to 1 year, and studied for enterotoxigenicity. By the coagglutination test, made with G. Kronvall's staphylococcal reagent prepared with the use of antiserum to Escherichia coli LT-enterotoxin, and the biological assay on suckling mice enterotoxigenic activity has been revealed in 119 strains, including 48 K. pneumoniae strains (12.6%), 33 E. cloacae strains (27.4%) and 23 E. aerogenes strains (19.7%). The strains producing only LT-enterotoxins, only ST-enterotoxins, and both LT- and ST-enterotoxins have been found. The determination of the enterotoxigenic activity of the clinical isolates of opportunistic enterobacteria makes it possible to improve the etiological interpretation of acute intestinal infections.
TI  - Growth of salmonellas in different enrichment media.
AB  - The usefulness of selenite-F (S-F), tetrathionate (MKT) and Rappaport-10 (R-10) broths as enrichment media to support growth of salmonellas either alone or in the presence of other competing organisms was studied. Their ability to support the growth of stressed salmonellas from water was also investigated. It was observed that R-10 was more inhibitory to competing organisms than MKT and S-F. It strongly inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris though not of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. It was more toxic, however, to small numbers of salmonellas than MKT and S-F. Tetrathionate was strongly inhibitory for E. coli and Ent. aerogenes but much less so for Proteus and Pseudomonas species. Selenite-F was much less inhibitory than MKT to Ps. aeruginosa and it did not inhibit growth of E. coli and Ent. aerogenes as much as MKT. Salmonellas were inhibited by all three enrichment media and none of them is ideally suited for direct use. Of the three media, R-10 was much more inhibitory to stressed organisms than S-F or MKT.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid was investigated against 285 freshly isolated clinical strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the agar-dilution technique on Mueller-Hinton-agar. Clavulanic acid had an excellent or moderate potentiating effect on the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin against staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides spp. No effect was seen against enterococci, indole-positive Proteus spp., Ent. cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effect of clavulanic acid was dose- and inoculum-dependent.
TI  - Affinity of cephalosporins for beta-lactamases as a factor in antibacterial efficacy.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae that were resistant to ceftazidime (MIC greater than 16 micrograms/ml) but susceptible to BMY 28142 (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml) were found to contain higher levels of beta-lactamase activity (50- to 3,340-fold) than control strains of the corresponding species. Ceftazidime was at least as resistant as BMY 28142 to hydrolysis by these enzymes. However, the apparent Ki of BMY 28142 for each enzyme was larger (8- to greater than 20-fold) than that of ceftazidime; i.e., the affinity of these enzymes for BMY 28142 appeared to be lower than that for ceftazidime. Thus, BMY 28142 was affected less than ceftazidime by a mechanism of resistance that depends, at least in part, on the relative affinities of cephalosporins for the beta-lactamases of these species. These results indicate that the affinity between a beta-lactamase and a cephalosporin may be a distinguishing factor in the evaluation of beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporins and suggest that affinity can play a major role in susceptibility to highly beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporins.
TI  - Studies on microbial quality of filtered water in households of a university community in Nigeria.
AB  - Water samples from home filters in nine residential areas of a Nigerian university community were studied. The membrane filter technique was used to determine the total coliform and faecal coliform counts/100 ml of water. Most of the 100 samples studied were grossly contaminated with total coliform counts/100 ml ranging from 0-442, faecal coliform counts/100 ml, 0-216 and the total aerobic plate count per millilitre ranged from 3.0 X 10(3) to 1.9 X 10(9) c.f.u. The source (dams) of water, fitness of filter candles, frequency of cleaning candles and pH of water did not significantly (P greater than 0.05; chi2) affect the microbial quality of either filtered boiled or unboiled tap water. Escherichia coli type I was isolated from 17.9% of the faecal coliforms tested but from only 2.3% of total coliforms. Enterobacter aerogenes was most predominant (38.5%) amongst faecal coliforms isolated while Enterobacter cloacae was the most frequent (37.2%) of the total coliform isolates. The gross contamination of filtered water from all households sampled calls for an enlightenment of residents on the proper use of home water filters.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. Of all strains tested, only three (1 Acinetobacter sp. and 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin resistant. Ciprofloxacin was more active against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter sp., Proteus sp., Shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. It was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa. It was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. It was as active as cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC's). Ciprofloxacin's MIC was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced by anaerobic conditions. Decrease of the medium pH increased the MIC substantially. Ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. These favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.
TI  - Studies on microorganisms secured from different organs of slaughtered sheep with special reference to the microbial load in certain muscles.
AB  - A total of 312 samples collected from different organs and muscles of dead, disabled, diseased, dying, and normal carcasses of sheep were examined bacteriologically to determine the different species of microorganisms as to their public health significance. In addition, the aerobic plate count (APC) and most probable number (MPN) coliform/g were determined of Musculus biceps brachii, Musculus quadriceps femoris, and Musculus longissimus dorsi. The mean bacterial load was higher in summer than in winter in dead and in normal sheep. Moreover, the APC was higher in winter 3 hours after slaughtering than after 24 h cooling. The bacterial load decreased in that order in the muscles of dead, disabled, diseased, and dying sheep carcasses. The lowest bacterial load was recorded in the Musculus longissimus dorsi. The most predominant isolates recovered from different organs and muscles were Escherichia coli (60), staphylococci (33), Proteus vulgaris (12), Enterobacter aerogenes (11), Corynebacterium ovis (9), Alcaligenes faecalis (7), Actinomyces israelii (5), Citrobacter freundii (4), pneumococci (3), and enterococci (2). The importance is discussed of the isolated strains as zoonotic agents and for assessing the hygienic meat quality.
TI  - R plasmids, KR61 and KR61-A, from Aerobacter aerogenes.
TI  - Interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in Escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP), the product of the malE gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. It is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer Tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). In studies of the maltose system in other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, we found that MBP is produced by Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Serratia marcescens. MBP from all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the E. coli protein and had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). The Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize MBP. The isoelectric points of MBP from different species varied from the acid extreme of E. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of E. aerogenes (8.9). All species with MBP transported maltose with high affinity, although the Vmax for K. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. Maltose chemotaxis was observed only in E. coli and E. aerogenes. In S. typhimurium LT2, Tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. MBP isolated from all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta malE strain of E. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.
TI  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. Ninety percent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, and Shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. Concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit Serratia marcescens and Providencia species, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae had MICs greater than 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae. Cefbuperazone did not inhibit Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas species. Hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis with MIC90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the P99 E. cloacae beta-lactamase with an I50 of 1 microgram/ml. It was a less effective inhibitor of the K. oxytoca K1 and E. coli TEM-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. Cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa and resistant E. cloacae. A permeability barrier in E. cloacae, C. freundii and P. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of cefbuperazone's activity by EDTA.
TI  - Growth of bacteria in enteral feeding solutions.
AB  - Solutions of Clinifeed ISO, Triosorbon, Vivonex Standard (full- and half-strength) and Vivonex HN were experimentally contaminated with two strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) organisms/ml. Samples were incubated at 4, 25 or 37 degrees C and viable counts were made at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. No increase in numbers of any of the organisms was observed in any of the feeds during 24 h at 4 degrees C. All organisms multiplied rapidly in Clinifeed ISO and in Triosorbon at 25 and 37 degrees C. There was less rapid growth in half-strength Vivonex Standard at 25 degrees C, although at 37 degrees C all strains multiplied rapidly except for the two S. aureus strains, the growth of which was inhibited in half-strength Vivonex Standard at both 25 and 37 degrees C. In full-strength Vivonex Standard at 25 degrees C, only P. aeruginosa showed any increase in numbers during 24 h, whereas P. aeruginosa, K. aerogenes and E. cloacae all multiplied at 37 degrees C. None of the test organisms multiplied in full strength Vivonex HN at any of the temperatures studied. The results of the study show that bacteria survive and may multiply even in feeds with low pH and high osmolarity, and emphasise the importance of strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feeds.
TI  - Influence of imipenem on the serum resistance of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Following growth in a subinhibitory concentration of imipenem and additional incubation in a 20% dilution of normal human serum (NHS) for 90 minutes, five of 12 serum-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae showed a decrease in colony-forming units of two or more logs of growth compared with the control. Two strains (of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes) showed this phenomenon even with incubation in 5% NHS. Treatment with imipenem did not change the serum resistance of the other seven strains (two strains each of Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Serratia marcescens, and one strain of Proteus morganii). The phenomenon of induced serum susceptibility is dose dependent and reversible. Other beta-lactam antibiotics either caused only a slight decrease of resistance (cefsulodin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefodizime-HR221) or did not influence the serum resistance at all (cefotaxime, mecillinam). Killing of the induced serum-sensitive strains appeared to be antibody dependent.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from Nsukka meat market: a zoonotic appraisal.
AB  - Swabs collected from butchers hands, knives, tables and meat displayed for sale at Nsukka meat market showed that every item screened was contaminated. Bacteria isolated include Streptococcus faecalis, coagulase positive Staphylococcus, Clostridium perfringens, Brucella species, Corynebacterium haemolyticum, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas multophilia, P. rubescens and beta-haemolytic Streptococci. The zoonotic or public health implications of such contaminations, their probable sources and possible ways of minimizing them are discussed.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Treatment of gram-negative infections with aztreonam.
AB  - Twenty-one patients with serious gram-negative infections were treated with aztreonam. Twenty of these were clinical and microbiologic cures; there was one clinical improvement with microbiologic persistence. No bacteria became resistant. Cure rates were: bone and joint (11 of 11); skin and soft tissue (six of six); pneumonia (two of two); perinephric abscess (one of one); and intra-abdominal abscess (zero of one). The bacteria responsible for these infections included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Serratia marcescens (two), Enterobacter gergoviae (three), Enterobacter aerogenes (two), Escherichia coli (one), Citrobacter diversus (one), and Hemophilus influenzae (one). Aztreonam was well tolerated. Significant serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase elevations developed in three patients, but none was symptomatic and all resolved after therapy was stopped. Two patients in whom a rash developed were receiving other antibiotics (vancomycin and metronidazole), making the cause of the rash unclear. Diarrhea developed in a single patient with Pseudomonas osteomyelitis, who also was receiving cefazolin for Staphylococcus aureus superinfection of his decubitus ulcer. Aztreonam was highly effective against gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa. The only clear-cut side effect was an asymptomatic rise in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels in three patients.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of aztreonam-clindamycin versus tobramycin-clindamycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A total of 80 patients were randomized to receive either aztreonam or tobramycin  for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli; all these patients received clindamycin concomitantly. A total of 53 patients were randomized to receive aztreonam-clindamycin; of these, 46 were clinically evaluable and 39 were bacteriologically evaluable. Of the 46 clinically evaluable patients, 41 were considered cured, 3 failed to be cured, and 2 died during the study period of unrelated causes. Of the 39 bacteriologically evaluable patients, 36 were considered cured, and 3 failed to be cured. There were 26 clinically evaluable patients in the group randomized to receive tobramycin-clindamycin. Of them, 22 patients were considered cured, 3 failed to be cured, and 1 died of unrelated causes during the study period. There were 18 bacteriologically evaluable patients in the tobramycin-clindamycin group; 17 were cured, and 1 failed to be cured. The most common pathogens isolated from the patients were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All of the isolated organisms were susceptible to both tested antibiotics, except for a strain of Pseudomonas cepacia resistant to both tested antimicrobial agents and a strain of Enterobacter aerogenes and one of P. aeruginosa that were resistant to aztreonam. Very few adverse reactions related to the antibiotics were seen. These effects, when present, were transient and comparable in both studied groups, except for renal-function tests, which were altered in 7.7% of the patients randomized to receive tobramycin-clindamycin and in none of the patients randomized to receive aztreonam-clindamycin. Aztreonam-clindamycin is safe and effective for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli when the organisms are susceptible.
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - Synergism of PS-5 with penicillins and cephalosporins in antimicrobial activity against beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative microorganisms.
AB  - The in vitro synergism of PS-5 combined with various penicillins and cephalosporins in antimicrobial activity was examined in detail against beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. PS-5 showed a highly significant synergism in antimicrobial action against Escherichia coli RGN238 in combination with penicillins; and against Proteus vulgaris GN76 and Serratia marcescens T55 in combination with cephalosporins. It was moderately synergistic against Citrobacter freundii GN346, Enterobacter cloacae 45, Proteus morganii 111 and Enterobacter aerogenes E19, whereas no synergism was observed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa E2 and Klebsiella pneumoniae 130.
TI  - [Transfer of kanamycin resistance among familial strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from a chronic bacterial carrier of Salmonella schottmuelleri].
AB  - Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and S. schottmuelleri were isolated from the large intestine of a bacteriocarrier. E. coli and E. aerogenes strains proved to be resistant to a number of antibiotics. Plasmids were detected in DNA preparations obtained from E. coli strains. After the hybridization of these E. coli strains with E. coli C600 5K and S. schottmuelleri at 28 degrees C the transfer of resistance to kanamycin was found to occur. From some of the transconjugates thus obtained resistance to kanamycin was transferred to E. aerogenes. This resistance was found to be controlled by the plasmid with a molecular weight exceeding 2 Md. The fact that S. schottmuelleri in the carrier's body retained their sensitivity to antibiotics can be explained by the absence of the transfer of plasmid Kmr at a temperature exceeding 28 degrees C and by the existence of the infective agent in an ecological niche other than that of E. coli.
TI  - Intergeneric homology of the speC gene encoding biosynthetic ornithine decarboxylase in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A 32P-labeled fragment of DNA containing the speC gene, which encodes the biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase of Escherichia coli, was used as a hybridization probe for homologous sequences in the genomes of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The speC probe detected homologous sequences in the DNA of only four members of the Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes); no homology was detected with the DNA of other representative members of the Enterobacteriaceae and gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to that of quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new methyl-4-piperazinyl quinolone. It had MIC90 values of less than 0.01 to 0.8 micrograms/ml for the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, oxytoca, Citrobacter, Providencia, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Morganella and Proteus mirabilis. It inhibited ampicillin, cephalexin and nalidixic acid resistant isolates of these species. Against Pseudomonas the pefloxacin MIC90 was 3.1 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus aureus had a MIC50 of 0.4 micrograms/ml and a MIC90 of 0.8 micrograms/ml and S. faecalis had a MIC90 of 3.1 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin inhibited Salmonella spp., Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Yersinia, Aeromonas, toxigenic E. coli at concentrations of less than 0.05 to 1.6 micrograms/ml, including ampicillin and trimethoprim resistant strains. There was a minimal difference in MIC and MBC values in broth or serum, but major changes in MIC and MBC values occurred in acid urine. Increase in MIC values occurred with repeated transfer in broth or urine.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. Observation on the MICS and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. CMX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and also Streptococcus Pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococci and Serratia marcescens, CMX showed the antimicrobial activity with MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml. However, CMX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against Streptococcus faecalis. Reliability of CMX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (Showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (Wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of CMX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, capable of utilizing CMX disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of CMX. Using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms CMX, FUCHS et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = MIC 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = MIC 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. In this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = MIC greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = MIC greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = MIC greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). Based on CMX pharmacokinetic data currently available, MIC break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial properties of FK 027, a new orally active cephem antibiotic.
AB  - FK 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as Citrobacter and Enterobacter species and Serratia marcescens. FK 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative Proteus species, Providencia species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. With few exceptions, FK 027 was active against strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. The bactericidal activity of FK 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including Proteus species, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and S. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. The therapeutic activities of FK 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  - In a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized, crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. The 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. The area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. Two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the MIC90 for all seven groups of pathogens; at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the MIC90 against the majority of bacterial groups. In contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the MIC90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. These data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the MICs90 longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. Such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.
TI  - [In vivo interferon-inducing capacity of a multibacterial extract: prospective new use].
AB  - We studied IFN inducing ability on syngenic C3H mice of a multibacterial antigenic extract consisting of different strains of following species: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris. A dose-dependent IFN production was demonstrated and two peaks of circulating IFN were observed few hours and two days after i.v. inoculation. Per os administration only at high doses induced evaluable levels of IFN in the circulation.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the gene coding for major outer membrane protein OmpA from Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - The ompA gene from Enterobacter aerogenes was subcloned into a low-copy-number plasmid vector and the resultant plasmid, pTU7En, used to study its expression in Escherichia coli K12. Although the gene was strongly expressed and large amounts of OmpA protein were present in the outer membrane its product was not functionally identical to the E. coli polypeptide. In particular, the E. aerogenes OmpA protein was unable to confer sensitivity to OmpA-specific phages of E. coli. When the primary structure of the protein was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of its gene it was found that three domains differed extensively from the corresponding regions of the E. coli protein. As two of these are known to be exposed on the cell surface we inferred that these alterations are responsible for differences in the biological activity of the two proteins.
TI  - Survey, purification, and properties of sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase among microorganisms.
AB  - Sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase was purified approximately 500- to 600-fold to apparent homogeneity from Escherichia coli B, Escherichia coli C, Escherichia coli var. communior, Escherichia acidilactici, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, and Saccharomyces cereviseae. The molecular weights of the enzyme as estimated by gel filtration ranged from 97 X 10(3) to 101 X 10(3). The enzyme was composed of two subunits with the same molecular weight which ranged from 50 X 10(3) to 52 X 10(3), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Homogeneous enzyme preparations hydrolyse all the tested alpha-D-aldohexose 1-phosphate, D-(keto or aldo)hexose 6-phosphate, and pentose phosphate substrates significantly. When the microorganisms were transferred from growth medium with 1% glucose to that without glucose, there were dramatic increases in both the specific and total enzyme activities. At least three isozymes appeared to be present in S. cereviseae, and two appeared to be present in E. coli B, E. coli var. communior, and N. meningitidis. Rabbit antiserum immunized against sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase purified from E. coli B cross-reacted with both the crude extracts and purified preparations of the enzyme from the other microorganisms. The presence of neither sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase activity nor immunocrossreacting material was detected in the following microorganisms: Aspergillus niger, Azotobacter chroococcum, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilis, Citrobacter freundii, Clostridium butyricum, Corynebacterium xerosis, Flavobacterium aquatile, Flavobacterium synxanthum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Micrococcus coralinus, Neisseria perflava, Neurospora crassa, Penicilium expansum, Penicilium notatum, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Saccharomyces fermenti, Sarcina lutea, and Streptomyces antibioticus. At present, no conclusive relationship can be established between the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system and the enzyme sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase among microorganisms. The physiological role of sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase as a transferase and regulatory enzyme is discussed.
TI  - Cefamandole-erythromycin-heparin peritoneal irrigation: an adjunct to the surgical treatment of diffuse bacterial peritonitis.
AB  - The enthusiasm for the use of peritoneal irrigation has waxed and waned since its introduction by Dr. Pierce in 1905. The purpose of this study was to devise a relatively low-cost irrigant that could be used for continuous intraperitoneal lavage, with the intent of decreasing abscess formation following surgical treatment for generalized bacterial peritonitis. A solution of 1 L of normal saline containing 50 mg erythromycin, 50 mg cefamandole, 500 U heparin, and 5 mEq KCl was proven in in vitro studies to be bactericidal to Peptococcus anaerobius and Clostridium perfringens, and bacteriostatic to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis. In a prospective study 50 patients underwent peritoneal lavage with 36 L over 2 days. No lavage patients developed intraabdominal abscesses. In a control group of 44 patients seven patients (15.9%) developed postoperative abscesses.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - [Influence of hemolytic plasmids on the development of the "killing" effect in various species of enterobacteria].
AB  - Experiments on isogenic strains of different enterobacterial species, both carrying hemolytic plasmids and free from them, have demonstrated that their "killing" effect on mice is linked with the yield of hemolysin and does not depend on the origin of Hly plasmids or the chemotype of bacteria. Plasmid p IE 567 coding the synthesis of alpha-hemolysin has been shown to be capable of expression in Enterobacter aerogenes, Hafnia alvei and Salmonella typhimurium strains, but E. aerogenes 3/43, H. alvei alpha 773 and Escherichia coli J53 carrying p IE 567, in contrast to E. coli P 678 and S. typhimurium 415 carrying the same plasmid, produce less alpha-hemolysin and have no pronounced effect in reducing the survival time of intranasally infected mice.
TI  - Evaluation of ceftazidime in the treatment of severe bacterial infection.
AB  - We investigated the clinical efficiency and safety of ceftazidime for treatment of 33 episodes of infection in 30 patients (17 males and 13 females), whose ages ranged from 9 to 92 years (mean 52.5). Fourteen patients had ultimately fatal disease and the remaining 16 had non-fatal diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the beginning of treatment was critical or poor in 16 cases. Episodes of infection treated were: 24 urinary tract infections (eight of them with concomitant bacteraemia), seven wound infections (one with concomitant bacteraemia and three with osteomyelitis), and two episodes of pneumonia. Twenty-nine episodes of infection were monomicrobial and the four remaining ones were polymicrobial. Significant organisms isolated were all aerobic or facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rods and were responsible for the following episodes of infection: Escherichia coli (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Pseudomonas cepacia (1), Proteus mirabilis (5), Serratia marcescens (2), Klebsiella (2), Enterobacter aerogenes (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). Total dosage of ceftazidime ranged from 28 to 240 g (mean 82.4 g), and mean duration of therapy was 17 days (range 8 to 44 days). The overall rate of clinical response to ceftazidime was 91%. Local and general tolerance to the drug was excellent. Enterococcal and/or candida colonization occurred in 12 episodes (36%) and superinfections by the same micro-organisms occurred in three episodes. Ceftazidime seems to be an effective and safe single agent for therapy of many bacterial infections, including those caused by Ps. aeruginosa.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Relative substrate affinity index values: a method for identification of beta-lactamase enzymes and prediction of successful beta-lactam therapy.
AB  - Using a nitrocefin competition assay, I determined the relative substrate affinity index (RSAI) values of nine clinically significant beta-lactamase enzymes against a range of beta-lactams. Using selected beta-lactam substrates, I observed large differences in the RSAI values of the nine enzymes that were sufficient in many cases to positively identify specific enzymes. I made use of the unique RSAI values of SHV-1, TEM-1, and TEM-2 beta lactamases with cefoxitin to screen for the presence of these enzymes in Klebsiella aerogenes clinical isolates. The RSAI values also allow for the prediction of the outcome of beta-lactam therapy against specific beta-lactamase-producing isolates.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of O-demethylfortimicin.
AB  - The activity of O-demethylfortimicin against ampicillin, cefazolin and carbenicillin resistant bacteria was determined. O-Demethylfortimicin showed excellent in-vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Ent. agglomerans, Ent. aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella, and Providencia inhibiting these organisms at less than or equal to 3.1 mg/l. It was particularly effective against Ent. cloacae and Serratia marcescens that were resistant to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam. O-Demethylfortimicin did not show particularly good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Acinetobacter or other Pseudomonas species, MIC90 values were 100 mg/l. Combination of O-demethylfortimicin and ticarcillin or cefsulodin tested against Ps. aeruginosa were primarily indifferent. Combination of O-demethylfortimicin and ticarcillin showed partial synergy for 65% of Enterobacter isolates.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefotetan and other cephalosporins against multiresistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The activity of cefotetan against multiresistant strains of Escherichia coli and  Klebsiella aerogenes was comparable with that of cefotaxime and ceftazidime, the mean MICs being 0.11 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively. Multiresistant strains of Enterobacter cloacae showed a high level of resistance to cefotetan in common with other cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefamandole and cefoxitin, but were sensitive to ceftazidime and cefotaxime.
TI  - Gene transfer between Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - Chromosomal replication origins (oriC) of Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae are functional in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The chromosomal DNA replication origins (oriC) from two members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, have been isolated as functional replication origins in Escherichia coli. The origins in the SalI restriction fragments of 17.5 and 10.2 kilobase pairs, cloned from E. aerogenes and K. pneumoniae, respectively, were found to be between the asnA and uncB genes, as are the origins of the E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium chromosomes. Plasmids containing oriC from E aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, and S. typhimurium replicate in the E. coli cell-free enzyme system (Fuller, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:7370--7374, 1981), and this replication is dependent on dnaA protein activity. These SalI fragments from E. aerogenes and K. pneumoniae carry a region which is lethal to E. coli when many copies are present. We show that this region is also carried on the E. coli 9.0-kilobase-pair EcoRI restriction fragment containing oriC. The F0 genes of the atp or unc operon, when linked to the unc operon promoter, are apparently responsible for the lethality.
TI  - Characterization of indicator bacteria in municipal raw water, drinking water, and new main water samples.
AB  - Municipal water samples were analyzed by membrane filter (MF) and presence-absence (P-A) tests for pollution indicator bacteria. In four years, 11 514 bacterial cultures were isolated from either raw water, drinking water, or new main water samples submitted to three environmental laboratories. The bacterial species occurring most often in all types of water samples were Escherichia coli (11.6-39.7%), Enterobacter aerogenes (18.1-26.3%), Aeromonas hydrophila (8.8-17.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.7-10.3%), and Citrobacter freundii (5.9-22.7%). A lactose - lauryl tryptose - tryptone broth was examined as an alternative medium to modified MacConkey broth in the presumptive portion of the P-A test. The intensity of acid and gas production in presumptive positive P-A bottles was compared with the types and frequencies of indicator bacteria shown by confirmatory tests. The results of detecting indicator bacteria following the analysis of 53 130 samples over a 2-year period were arranged by water source (well, lake, river, mixed) and water type (raw or drinking) to determine the influence of these parameters on the recovery of indicator bacteria. A further subdivision of the sample types into raw surface, raw ground, in-plant, plant discharge, reservoir, and distribution samples demonstrated the effect of water treatment practices.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefmenoxime.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. It was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. It had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria spp. Cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, and Shigella. It inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against Morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), Proteus vulgaris and Providencia spp. It was as active as ceftizoxime was against Serratia. Pseudomonas spp. and Bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). The compound was stable to the common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of TEM. It was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by Bacteroides and Acinetobacter.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Primary structure of the chromosomal origins (oriC) of Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae: comparisons and evolutionary relationships.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of the Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae  DNA replication origins (oriC) were determined and compared with those of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Four interrelated, 9-base-pair repeats were identified from the conserved regions within the minimal origin. Evolutionary rates calculated from the minimal origin sequences yielded a quantitative phylogenic tree which agreed with the taxonomic classification of these genera.
TI  - In vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-Pseudomonas cephalosporins.
AB  - Apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of Escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). Apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter diversus. Against Klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. The activity of apalcillin against Enterobacter (E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, and E. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. The activity of apalcillin against Proteus mirabilis was similar to that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive Proteus and Providencia. Only 40% of Serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. Apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis. It was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). There was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. Apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.
TI  - Expression in Escherichia coli K12 of the cloned genes for a major outer membrane protein (OmpA protein) from Shigella dysenteriae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Influence of diluents, media, and membrane filters on detection fo injured waterborne coliform bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter freundii were injured ( greater than 90%) in water from a dead-end section of the Bozeman, Montana, distribution system. The effects of the following laboratory variables on the enumeration efficiency of injured and undamaged control cells were examined: (i) diluent composition, temperature, and time of exposure; (ii) media, using various formulations employed in enumerating gram-negative bacteria; and (iii) surface pore morphology of membrane filters. The addition of peptone or milk solids to diluents and low temperature (4 degrees C) maximized the recovery of injured cells, but had little effect on undamaged cells. Control cells were recovered with high efficiencies on most media tested, but recoveries of injured cells ranged from 0 to near 100%. Most of the media commonly used in water analysis recovered less than 30% of injured cells. This was explained in part by the sensitivity of injured bacteria to deoxycholate concentrations greater than 0.01%, whereas control cells were unaffected by 0.1%. Membrane filter surface pore morphology (at 35 degrees C) had a negligible effect on total coliform recoveries. Recommendations are made regarding procedures to improve the recovery of injured coliforms by routine laboratory practices.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli K-12 of the genes for major outer membrane protein OmpA from Shigella dysenteriae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - The outer membranes of many gram-negative bacteria contain a major heat-modifiable protein which shows serological cross-reactivity with the OmpA protein of Escherichia coli K-12. Using the cloned gene for the E. coli K12 protein as a DNA-DNA hybridization probe, we were able to identify the corresponding genes from Shigella dysenteriae. Enterobacter aerogenes, and Serratia marcescens. These were cloned in a phage lambda vector, and their expression in E. coli K-12 was studied. All three OmpA proteins were fully produced and correctly exported to the outer membrane. In several cases, complete or partial restoration of known function of the E. coli K-12 protein was observed.
TI  - Augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. When combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of Gram-negative bacilli. Bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, in addition strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. The beta-lactamases produced by Enterobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant to augmentin (1).
TI  - The inhibition of bacterial cell growth by ketone bodies.
AB  - The effect of ketone bodies on the growth, in culture, of Escherichia coli was investigated. Both growth and glucose utilisation were inhibited in the presence of 20 mmol/l D-3-hydroxybutyrate. Lower concentrations of D-3-hydroxybutyrate caused proportionally less inhibition of growth. Acetoacetate also inhibited growth but other glycolytic inhibitors and chemical analogues of D-3-hydroxybutyrate either did not inhibit or proved to be too toxic for bacterial growth. Citrate enhanced the ketone body effect. D-3-hydroxybutyrate also inhibited the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Salmonella typhimurium. The possible relationship between ketone body inhibition of cell growth and oxygen limitation is discussed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (GR 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis, with the mean MICs varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. It had marked activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mean MIC of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. Although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against E. coli, K. aerogenes and Ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean MICs between 5 and 21 mg/l. These results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due to strains of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Coliform inhibition by bacteriocin-like substances in drinking water distribution systems.
AB  - Bacterial isolates from an unchlorinated potable groundwater system and a chlorinated surface water system were screened by an agar overlay method for the ability to produce bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) inhibitory to the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., and Enterobacter aerogenes. The production of coliform-specific BLS by noncoliform bacteria varied with the site and date of isolation as well as the genus of the producer strain. A total of 448 bacterial isolates were screened from the chlorinated system, and 22.1% produced BLS specific for at least one of the three coliforms. In the unchlorinated system, 7.9% (n = 696) possessed this ability. Flavobacterium/Moraxella comprised 57.1% of all bacteria (from both systems) producing BLS. The possibility that BLS interfere with coliform detection in standard bacteriological water quality tests is discussed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of FR-31564, a phosphonic acid antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activity of FR-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(N-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The in vitro activity of FR-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. In vitro activity of FR-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. The type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with Mueller-Hinton, heart infusion, or Trypticase soy agars. FR-31564 was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Citrobacter. It was less active than fosfomycin against Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. FR-31564 inhibited a number of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and some Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. In the presence and absence of human blood FR-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and P. aeruginosa exposed to FR-31564 for 3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. FR-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with P. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. It was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with E. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.
TI  - Phagocytic and chemiluminescent responses of mouse peritoneal macrophages to living and killed Salmonella typhimurium and other bacteria.
AB  - In the presence of luminol, resident as well as thioglycolate-induced and immunized macrophages emitted chemiluminescence more efficiently when the cells were exposed to living Salmonella typhimurium than when they were exposed to the same bacterium killed by ultraviolet light or heat. This phenomenon was observed whether or not the bacterium was opsonized. The different response to living and killed bacteria was also found with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus morganii, and Enterobacter aerogenes, but not with Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Propionibacterium acnes. The results suggest that macrophages respond better to living, motile bacteria than to nonmotile or killed bacteria. The experimental results obtained with motility mutants of S. typhimurium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa confirm that macrophages exposed to the motile bacteria emit chemiluminescence more efficiently and ingest the motile bacteria at a much faster rate than the nonmotile bacteria.
TI  - Effect of solar radiation and predacious microorganisms on survival of fecal and  other bacteria.
AB  - The effect of solar radiation and predacious microorganisms on the survival of bacteria of fecal and plant origin was studied. The decline in the numbers of Escherichia coli cells in estuarine water samples was found to be significantly greater in the presence of both naturally occurring microbial predators and solar radiation than when each of these factors was acting independently. The effect of solar radiation on microbial predators was negligible, whereas the susceptibility of bacteria to light-induced decay varied from one organism to another, as follows: Klebsiella pneumoniae greater than E. coli greater than Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia herbicola.
TI  - Cefonicid: a stable beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  - The stability of cefonicid (SK&F 75073) towards representatives of six major classes of beta-lactamases was determined using a spectrophotometric assay. Cefonicid was stable to hydrolysis by the Type I enzyme from Enterobacter cloacae and by the enzyme from the anaerobe, Bacteroides fragilis. It was 6 to 7 times more stable than cefamandole to the Type IIIA and B enzymes from Escherichia coli, a little less stable than this antibiotic to the Type V enzyme from E. coli, and of equal stability to the Type IV enzyme from Klebsiella aerogenes. Cefonicid was a non-competitive inhibitor (Ki of 0.8 x 10(-6)M) of cephalothin hydrolysis by the Type I enzyme.
TI  - Klebsiella and Enterobacter strains derived from hospital infections. II. Occurrence and characterization of R-, Lac- and Col- plasmids and their clinical-epidemiological significance.
AB  - A total of 269 hospital Klebsiella strains and 103 hospital Enterobacter strains  showed 34 and 10 different antibiotic resistance patterns, respectively. Among multiple resistant Klebsiella and Enterobacter strains the Ap Sm Cm Tc resistance pattern was the most frequent (K. aerogenes). Antibiotic resistant strains carried R-plasmids in 27.5%. The presence of R-plasmids was demonstrable in 2.9% of single antibiotic resistant, in 12.8% of double antibiotic resistant, and in 71.4% of multiple antibiotic resistant Klebsiella strains. R-plasmid carriage was most frequent in strains of the species K. pneumoniae and K. atlantae. Transfer frequency of R-plasmids of multiple resistant strains was generally higher into Escherichia coli K12 recipient (10-1 to 10-2) than into K. pneumoniae recipient (10-3 to 10-5). Regarding the individual resistance determinants, transfer frequency of Km-Nm resistance was the highest (65.1%). The lac-plasmid was demonstrable in 18 out of the 77 R-plasmid carrying Klebsiella strains. R- and Lac-plasmids of single and multiple resistant Klebsiella strains could be transferred into E. coli and Klebsiella recipients in mice in vivo. As many as 67% showed fi- and 33% showed fi+ character among the demonstrated 112 R-plasmids. Regarding their incompatibility, the studied five plasmids belonged to groups FI, FII and I alpha. Altogether 14 different groups could be distinguished among R-plasmids on the basis of their phage restriction capability on phage lambda and coliphages T, and another group of R-plasmids showing no restriction at all. Fi+ character was demonstrated in 54.5% of R-plasmids showing phage restriction capability and in 10.9% of R-plasmids showing no phage restriction. Nearly twice as many R-plasmids carrier strains were found among non-typable ones as among those typable by phages. Three R-plasmids showed phage-modification among 51 R-plasmids restrictive for phages. In addition to the phage-type of Klebsiella strains, R-plasmids can also be used as an epidemiologic marker.
TI  - A comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  - The sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. All bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. All strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. Only non-identical strains were used. A tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. The results showed that all strains of H. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. The other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. Cefoperazone had potent activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.
TI  - Introduction of bacteriophage Mu into bacteria of various genera and intergeneric gene transfer by RP4::Mu.
AB  - The host range of coliphage Mu was greatly expanded to various genera of gram-negative bacteria by using the hybrid plasmic RP4::Mu cts, which is temperature sensitive and which confers resistance to ampicillin, kanamycin, and tetracycline. These drug resistance genes were transferred from Escherichia coli to members of the general Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Salmonella, Proteus, Erwinia, Serratia, Alcaligenes, Agrobacterium, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Acetobacter, and Bacillus. Mu phage was produced by thermal induction from the lysogens of all these drug-resistant bacteria except Bacillus. Mu phage and RP4 or the RP4::Mu plasmid were used to create intergeneric recombinant strains by transfer of some genes, including the arylsulfatase gene, between Klebsiella aerogenes and E. coli. Thus, genetic analysis and intergeneric gene transfer are possible in these RP4::Mu-sensitive bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of the four-hour Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, Gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  - A 4-h Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by API 20E and Micro-ID, using standardized inocula. A total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. Isolates included 96 Escherichia coli, 46 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Klebsiella oxytoca, 8 Enterobacter aerogenes, 17 Enterobacter cloacae, 19 Serratia marcescens, 2 Serratia liquefaciens, 8 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Salmonella species, 1 Morganella morganii, 6 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 Bacteroides fragilis, 3 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia. In 90% of the cultures, identification by Micro-ID was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. Enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct Micro-ID were three S. marcescens (two identified as S. liquefaciens, one as Hafnia alvei), two S. liquefaciens (both identified as E. cloacae), and two K. pneumoniae (one identified as Klebsiella ozaenae, the other as Serratia rubidaea). None of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by Micro-ID (non-identifiable, or classified as Providencia/Yersinia/Klebsiella species). Although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final Micro-ID tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. Direct species identification of Enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct Micro-ID is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct Micro-ID technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
TI  - Antigenic relationships between pore proteins of Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - Antisera were raised against the purified Escherichia coli K12 outer membrane proteins ompA-, ompC- and ompF proteins and protein e. Several immunological methods were used to investigate the specificity of the antisera and the immunological relationship between the major outer membrane proteins. Although the antisera had been raised against highly purified proteins, several of them contained activity against lipopolysaccharide and lipoprotein due to minor impurities in the immunogens. The three general porins ompF protein, ompC protein and protein e were shown to be cross-reactive. Anti-(ompA protein) serum only reacted with the homologous protein. None of these antisera reacted with the phage lambda receptor protein or with protein III. Pore protein preparations isolated from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloaceae and Proteus mirabilis were found to be structurally related to the E. coli K12 porins as they reacted with the antisera raised against E. coli K12 porins.
TI  - [Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of representatives of the enterobacteriaceae family in postradiation intestinal dysbacteriosis].
AB  - The irradiation of CBA mice with gamma quanta in a dose of 700 C/kg resulted in the development of postradiation intestinal dysbacteriosis in the animals. The dysbacteriosis was characterized by a considerable increase in the number of Escherichia and Proteus mirabilis in the large intestine and by the insemination of the small intestine with these microbial associations. Pr. vulgaris, Pr. morganii, Ent. aerogenes, Ent. cloacae, Citrobacter appeared in great numbers in the intestinal tract of the irradiated mice, while none of these organisms were found in the intact mice.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftizoxime, a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftizoxime was compared with that of other beta-lactam  antibiotics against 538 isolates. Ceftizoxime was the most active agent tested against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, inhibiting 80% at 0.025 microgram/ml. It was more active than cefotaxime against Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes. Ceftizoxime was more active than cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and carbenicillin against Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus. It inhibited 97% of multiresistant Serratia isolates at 12.5 microgram/ml, whereas cefotaxime inhibited only 19%. Ceftizoxime was less active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than carbenicillin. It was more active than cefotaxime and cefoxitin against Bacteroides. It was not appreciably destroyed by beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, or Pseudomonas.
TI  - [Interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-L-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. The following species produced gamma GT: Citrobacter freundii, Levinea malonatica, L. amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, Hafnia alvei, Erwinia carotovora, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, S. marinorubra, S. odorifera, S. ficaria, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgeri, Providencia alcalifaciens, P. stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Most strains of Escherichia coli and Alkalescens Dispar group are gamma GT+. The following species did not produce gammaGT: Shigella sonnei, Edwardsiella tarda, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and Yersinia pestis. Within the Salmonella, most strains of subgenus I, II and IV, and diphasic strains of subgenus III (S. arizonae) produced gamma GT, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus III did not produce gammaGT. Salmonella enteritidis (gammaGT+) and S. dublin (gammaGT-) can readily be distinguished. This test (gammaGT) could also serve as a biochemical marker for S. typhi-murium strains. Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammaGT+ whereas other serotypes were gammaGT-. Within S. flexneri serotype 6, varieties Boyd 88 and Newcastle were found gammaGT+; and varieties Sussex and Manchester were gammaGT-. The use of gammaGT test as an epidemiological marker for other Shigella serotypes is suggested.
TI  - [Diagnosis of fecal coliforms in dairy products by the temperature tests].
AB  - The study concerned the formation of gas and acid in broth with lactose and glucose and brilliant green at 30,37 and 44 degrees C and of indole in peptone water at 30, 37 and 44 degrees C by 842 coliform strains isolated from 386 samples of dairy products (E. coli I--496, E. coli--51, Citrob. freundi--87, Citrob. intermedium--46, Enterobacter aerogenes--98, Enterobacter cloacae -- 32 and K1. aerogenes 32). It was found that Eijkman's test (formation of gas and acid from lactose in broth with brilliant green at 44 degrees C) yields no real results and cannot be used for rapid differentiation of the fecal coliforms. The test of McKenzie, Taylor and Gilbert (formation of gas and acid from lactose in broth with brilliant green at 44 degrees C and indole at 44 degrees C) gives satisfactory results for quick determination of the expected E. coli I amount. E. coli I amount should be determined solely on the basis of IMVIC tests.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of heparin.
AB  - Single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. At heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 U/ml, the effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. All 10 isolates of S. aureus and all 10 of S. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 U/ml. Three E. coli, four P. aeruginosa, and nine C. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 U of heparin per ml. None of the K. pneumoniae, E. aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 U/ml. Heparin inhibition of S. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 U of heparin per ml could be quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. These data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.
TI  - Competition of beta-lactam antibiotics for the penicillin-binding proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus rettgeri, and Escherichia coli: comparison with antibacterial activity and effects upon bacterial morphology.
AB  - The competition of a number of beta-lactam morphogenic probes for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus rettgeri, and Escherichia coli has been studied. The results indicate that the various gram-negative bacteria have similar, but not identical, PBP patterns and that the individual proteins probably perform similar morphogenic functions as in E. coli K-12. Comparison of the 50% binding concentrations of the compounds for the various PBPs of the five strains with their antibacterial activity indicates that the different antibiotics are excluded to a greater or lesser degree by the outer membrane permeability barrier and that the exclusion is most pronounced in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Storage of microtiter plates for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  - Microdilution susceptibility tests are being performed routinely and in increasing numbers in many clinical laboratories. Microtiter plates for these assays are usually prepared in large batches and stored frozen until needed. Studies were performed to investigate the stability at -20C and at -70C of ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and cephalothin, using Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella as test organisms. The stability at -20C and -70C of clindamycin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, oxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and penicillin was analyzed using Staphylococcus eureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, and alpha Streptococcus as the test organisms. No significant deterioration of any of the antibiotics was noted after ten weeks of storage at -70C, as detected by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations. No significant differences were noted at -20C for clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. By ten weeks' storage at -20C, significant deterioration of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin was observed.
TI  - Bacteriocin typing of Serratia marcescens. A simplified system.
AB  - The authors describe a simplified system for the detection of bacteriocin production by Serratia marcescens with the use of six indicator strains, which include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes (two strains), and Serratia rubidaea grown on arabinose minimal medium plates. Of the 64 possible bacteriocin types, 11 were observed; 66% of the isolates tested were found to be one of three types. Occasionally more than one bacteriocin type was observed in an individual specimen; however, serotyping or antibiograms, or both, also indicated this was a different strain. The marcescin types were stable markers. With the use of this technic, different endemic strains of Serratia were shown to predominate in various areas of the hospital. In addition, when urinary tract isolates were compared with respiratory tract isolates, significant differences were found in the predominate types. The typing of these isolates by bacteriocin production was supported by serotype and antibiotype findings. The results suggest that this simple system may be a useful tool in a general hospital.
TI  - [On the contamination of the citric acid fermentation. I. The contamination by representatives of Enterobacteriaceae (author's transl)].
AB  - Among the most dangerous bacterial contaminations of the citric acid fermentation is the so-called brown contamination, which is called forth by non pathogenic representatives of Enterobacteriaceae like Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, while other bacteria do not produce the mentioned contamination. There is given a comprehensive characterization of the brown contamination. Enterobacteriaceae interrupt the growth of the mycelium of the mold Aspergillus niger and stop the production of citric acid, produce a characteristic repugnant smell and reduce nitrate to nitrite. In a case of weak contamination the phenomena of the brown contamination do not appear, but the yield of citric acid is rather low. The contamination may be transferred successfully within the first 24 hrs. of incubation. The effect of the bacteria is determined by their virulence and some other factors.
TI  - Differential survival of Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter aerogenes on lettuce in the field.
AB  - Artificial contamination of young lettuce plants with Salmonella typhi (ST), Escherichia coli (EC), and Enterobacter aerogenes (EA) in the field in winter and summer resulted in presence of the pathogen and increased density of the two indicator bacteria (IB) in harvested produce. Viable counts of the three bacteria/g fresh weight declined at a decreasing rate with increasing time after contamination. The overall pattern of variation of the ST/IB ratio was correlated more closely with changes in the ST/EA than in the ST/EC ratio values. When viable counts were expressed as a proportion of the contaminating dose at different times after contamination, however, a closer similarity existed between ST and EC than between ST and EA values throughout winter and through the early part of summer experiments.
TI  - Comparative activities of ampicillin, epicillin and amoxycillin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three aminopenicillins ampicillin, epicillin and  amoxycillin were compared in vitro and in vivo. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the three penicillins were very similar and the compounds were active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Streptococci including Streptococcus faecalis, and non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were also sensitive to the compounds but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus species were resistant. At concentrations close to MIC value epicillin and ampicillin showed similar bactericidal activity against E. coli and against S. typhi and both compounds caused a slower rate of kill than was seen with amoxycillin. Microscopical observation of the cells exposed to ampicillin and epicillin for 1 h showed the presence of filamentous forms which lysed slowly, whereas cells exposed to amoxycillin for the same period rapidly. Epicillin was similar to or slightly less active than ampicillin against experimental mouse infections, and against the majority of infections both compounds were significantly less effective than amoxycillin by the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration.
TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Trypsin peptide patterns of tryptophan synthase beta2 protein among four species  of the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The tryptophan synthase beta 2 protein (EC 4.2.1.20) of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia carotovora was purified and compared. Two-dimensional total peptide patterns for each of the four beta2 proteins obtained after digestion with trypsin showed that approximately three quarters of the total peptides are common to all four peptides. Examination of only arginine-containing peptides showed that approximately half of these peptides are common. From a comparative standpoint, the data provide evidence that the primary structure of beta 2 proteins is relatively similar, indicating that the trpB cistron is evolutionarily conserved in the enteric bacteria group.
TI  - [Numerical taxonomic studies on enterobacteria of surface-water (author's transl)].
AB  - 435 enterobacterial strains of surface-water were tested in 35 physiological characters and classified numerically by a single-linkage procedure. The relations of similarity are shown in a "Vernetzungsdiagramm" (connected graph, Fig. 1). Tab. 1 specifies the characters of the taxa, which were formed graphically. The following facts are the result of this taxonomic classification: 1. 32% of the Escherichia group are KCN-positive. In addition it was found that 60% of the E. coli isolated from the faeces of wild ducks were KCN-positive. 2. The type strains of the species Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella aerogenes show a far reaching conformity in their physiological character. The splitting into two genera does not seem to be of significance any longer. 3. By reason of the "Vernetzungsdiagramm" and the table of characters (Tab. 1) we propose to regroup the genera Enterobacter and Erwinia. The genus Erwinia represented here by bacteria of the Herbicola-Lathyri-group is clearly divided into two groups. In the discussion we propose for Erwinia I the name of Enterobacter agglomerans and for Erwinia II the name of Enterobacter herbicola. 4. The taxa Kluyvera and Levinea are placed in the vicinity of Enterobacter cloacae and Erwinia II (Enterobacter herbicola), respectively.
TI  - Differentiation of Serratia marcescens and Serratia liquefaciens by tests for lipase and phospholipase production.
AB  - The production of lipase and phospolipase by certain members of the Enterobacteriaceae was examined by thin-layer chromatography of resting-cell suspensions incubated with triolein or lecithin. Most strains of Serratia marcescens produced both enzymes while most strains of Serratia liquefaciens exhibited strong lipase but only a minor phospholipase activity. Enterobacter spp. (25 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20 strains), Escherichia coli (15 strains), Citrobacter freundii (7 strains) and Proteus spp. (20 strains) lacked both types of enzymic activity except for the following: three strains of Enterobacter cloacae, two of Proteus mirabilis and three of Proteus vulgaris possessed slight lipase activity; about one-half of the Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter hafniae strains examined produced slight phospholipase activity. It is suggested that tests for lipase and phospholipase should be used in conjunction with those for DNAase production and sugar fermentation for the differentiation of S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of some cyclic hydroxamic acids and related lactams.
AB  - Against Enterobacter aerogenes 13048, Serratia marcescens 13880, Klebsiella pneumoniae 10031, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, Escherichia coli 9723, Lactobacillus casei 7469, Lactobacillus plantarum 8014, Leuconostoc dextranicum 8086, and Streptococcus faecalis 8043, the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of three cyclic hydroxamic acids, 3-amino-3,4-dihydro-1-hydroxycarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 0.6, 0.6, and 0.2 micrograms/ml, and those of the corresponding lactams, 3-amino-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 60, 60, and 6 micrograms/ml, respectively. Under the same assay conditions the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol and kanamycin were both 2 micrograms/ml. In addition, the cyclic hydroxamic acids but not the lactams inhibited the growth of Candida albicans at minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 micrograms/ml, at pH 7, as compared with that of amphotericin B, at 2 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo studies with BL-S786, cefoxitin, and cefamandole.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of BL-S786, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against 90 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes, were studied by using an agar dilution procedure. Comparison of geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentrations showed that BL-S786 was half as active as cefamandole against Enterobacter species, 2 to 4 times more active than cefamandole against all other species, and 4 to 25 times more active than cefoxitin against all species. In vivo experiments employed acute protection tests in infected mice, using five isolates each of the five genera. Drugs were administered intramuscularly in two doses 3 h apart at dosages of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg per mouse. In most instances, BL-S786 was the most efficacious drug, being some 1.3 to 9.1 times more active than cefoxitin in all experiments and 1.5 to 8.7 times more active than cefamandole in most experiments. BL-S786 and cefamandole were comparable in activity in experiments with E. aerogenes, whereas BL-S786 was superior in experiments with E. cloacae.
TI  - Colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - A study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. Groups of germfree AKR mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: Streptococcus faecalis. Lactobacillus brevis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and Torulopsis sp. All species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. Later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of E. coli or P. aeruginosa. The presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. Escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. Evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the colonization of P. aeruginosa and not of E. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
TI  - [Characteristics of the enterobacteria strains isolated from the urine in urinary tract infections].
AB  - Study of biochemical properties of 421 strains of enterobacteria permitted to refer them to the following taxonomic groups of which E. coli constituted 83,4 +/- 3.6%, Enterobactercloacae--97 +/- 3.0%, Klebsiella 4.0 +/- 2.0%. Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter hafnia, Citrobacter, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris were revealed in individual cases (0.2-1.0%). As a result of serological typing there were revealed 105 serological types of Escherichia differing by 55 O-antigen variants, 26 H-antigen variants, and the presence or absence of K-antigen. The following groups occurred most frequently-01, 02, 04, 06, 08, 09, 015, 016, 017, 018, 025, 028, and 075. There were also revealed new 0154 and 0155 groups. In 30.9 + 5,3% of cases Escherichia did not belong to the known 157 O-groups; among them 87.1 +7,2% of the strains had H-antigens which could not be referred to any of the known variants according to the international designation.
TI  - The effects of temperature and growth rate on the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in bacterial lipids.
AB  - The effects of temperature and growth rate on the fatty acid composition of the extractable lipids of four mesophilic and three psychotrophic bacteria were examined. Two of the mesophiles (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their lipids with decreasing temperature over their whole growth temperature range. The other mesophiles (Enterobacter aerogenes and Lactobacillus casei) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids with decreasing temperature only over the lower half of their growth temperature ranges. The psychrotrophs Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter sp. had a constant proportion of unsaturated acids over the lower half of their growth temperature range, while the psychotrophic Lactobacillus sp. showed no consistent change in its unsaturated fatty acid composition with temperature. All species showed some variation of unsaturated fatty acid composition with growth rate at the highest and lowest growth temperatures, although such variations were small in some species (Ent. aerogenes and Lactobacillus sp.).
TI  - Lytic activity of a new cephalosporin, cefuroxime, against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Cefuroxime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was inhibitory at low concentrations  to several types of gram-negative bacteria. It was considerably more stable than cephaloridine or cephalothin to the beta-lactamases produced by Escherichia coli (RP1), Klebsiella aerogenes K1 and Enterobacter cloacae P99. Concentrations of cefuroxime much greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were usually necessary to induce lysis of beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producers. In contrast, cephaloridine, cephalothin and ampicillin were rapidly bacteriolytic at, or near, the respective MIC against non-beta-lactamase producers, whereas the activity of these three antibiotics was considerably reduced against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
TI  - Aminopeptidase I activities in several microorganisms.
AB  - Aminopeptidase I activity which was found to be localized in the same subcellular fraction and to be similarly heat stable was partially purified by a common procedure from Escherichia coli B, Escherichia coli K12, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris. The enzyme preparations were shown to contain a single animopeptidase active toward both leucylleucine and methionylalanylserine by mixed-substrate initial-velocity kinetic analysis. The Km value for leucylleucine was virtually identical for the aminopeptidases of all of the organisms, as was the Km value for methionylalanylserine.
TI  - Microbial conversion of DL-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid to L-cysteine and L-cystine: screening of microorganisms and identification of products.
AB  - Microorganisms able to form L-cysteine from DL-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (DL-ATC), a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of DL-cysteine, were isolated from soil samples and classified as Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas cohaerens, P. desmolytica, and P. ovalis. Thirteen L-cysteine-producing bacteria were also found in among 463 stock cultures representing 37 genera. These were Achromobacter delmarvae. Alcaligenes denitrificans, Bacillus brevis, Brevibacterium flavum, Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia carotovora, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus sodonensis, Myocoplana dimorpha, Sarcina lutea, Serratia marcescens, Flavobacterium acidoficum, and Pseudomonas ovalis. In the presence of intact cells of Pseudomonas sp. AJ 3854, 6.1 mg of L-cysteine and/or L-cystine per ml was produced from 10 mg of DL-ATC-3H2O per ml in a molar yield of 100%. This finding suggests that racemization and asymmetric hydrolysis occurred simultaneously in this incubation mixture. After the complete oxidation of cysteine to cystine by aeration in the presence of ferrous ion, crystalline cystine was isolated; its configuration was the L isomer based on data from X-ray diffraction, microbioassay, and optical rotation studies.
TI  - In vitro activities of five oral cephalosporins against aerobic pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Cefaclor (Lilly 99638) and cefatrizine (BL-S640, SK&F 70771) are orally absorbed, broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporins. They were compared in vitro with cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cepharadine against a variety of aerobic pathogenic bacteria by an agar dilution procedure. Cefaclor and cefatrizine were found to be similar or superior to cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cephradine in terms of activity against gram-positive cocci other than enterococci. Only cefatrizine demonstrated any potentially useful activity against some susceptible isolates of enterococci. Cefaclor and cefatrizine also were highly active, equally or more so than the other oral cephalosporins, against several gram-negative species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. None of the cephalosporins were particularly active against Enterobacter cloacae. Both cefaclor and cefatrizine were active against Proteus mirabilis; cefatrizine was uniquely active against indolepositive Proteus species.
TI  - Intracellular distribution of enzymes of phospholipid metabolism in several gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Cell-free extracts of Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Micrococcus cerificans contained the following enzymatic activities related to phospholipid metabolism: cytidine 5'-diphospho-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (CDP-diglyceride):l-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase (phosphatidylserine synthase), phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, CDP-diglyceride:sn-glycero-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase (phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase), phosphatidylglycerophosphate phosphatase, and CDP-diglyceride hydrolase. The intracellular distribution of these enzymatic activities as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of cell-free extracts was shown to be similar in each species investigated. The phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase, and CDP-diglyceride hydrolase activities were all associated with the cell envelope fraction, whereas the phosphatidylserine synthase activity was associated mainly with the ribosomal fraction. These enzymatic activities are comparable and have an intracellular distribution similar to those found in Escherichia coli cell-free extracts. Therefore, the pathways established for phospholipid biosynthesis in E. coli can also account for the synthesis of the major phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol) in several other gram-negative organisms. In addition, the unusual ribosomal association of the phosphatidylserine synthase from E. coli (Raetz and Kennedy, J. Biol. Chem. 247:2008-2014, 1972) appears to be a general property for this activity in several other bacterial species.
TI  - Laboratory studies on mecillinam: activity alone and combined with cephradine.
AB  - Mecillinam (MC) was found to be inhibitory at low concentrations to a wide range  of Gram-negative bacteria; the sensitivity of such strains could be predicted by using a 10 microgram disk. Resistance to MC did not appear to be associated with beta-lactamase-mediated destruction of the antibiotic. Ampicillin-resistant strains tended to be less sensitive to MC. MC and cephradine acted synergistically against Proteus mirabilis, Pr. vulgaris, Prov. stuartii and Serratia marcescens, and the combination was additive against most Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Immunization with R mutants of Salmonella minnesota. II. Comparison of the protective effect of immunization with lipid A and the Re mutant.
AB  - The protective effect of active immunization with Salmonella minnesota Re bacilli or lipid A was assessed in the granulocytopenic rabbit model. Animals were immunized with Re bacilli, lipid A, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a nonspecific immunogen. After colonization with one of three enterobacterial strains (two Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter aerogenes), the immunized rabbits as well as controls given saline injections were made leukopenic with nitrogen mustard and monitored for fever, bacteremia, and death. Survival rates were significantly greater in Re-immunized animals than in saline controls or P. aeruginosa-immunized animals. Immunization with lipid A afforded no protection. In addition, rabbits immunized with Re mutant bacilli developed bacteremia less frequently than the others, indicating that antibody to Re may inhibit invasion of the intestinal mucosa as well as protect after bacteremia has developed.
TI  - Clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from Streptomyces clavuligerus.
AB  - A novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. Conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. This compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in Escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. The cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae P99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. coli are less well inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus, K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and E. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.
TI  - Intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  - Several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. The following species: Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -II. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.
TI  - Immunochemical comparison of phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase-indoleglycerol  phosphate synthetase among the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The bifunctional enzyme of the tryptophan operon, phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase-indoleglycerol phosphate synthetase (PRAI-InGPS;EC 4.1.1.48), was characterized by an immunochemical study of six representative members of the Enterobacteriaceae: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Proteus vulgaris. PRAI-InGPS was purified from E. coli, and antisera were prepared in rabbits. These antisera were utilized in quantitative microcomplement fixation allowing for a comparison of the overall antigenic surface structure of the various homologous enzymes. These data showed E. coli PRAI-InGPS and S. marcescens and E. carotovora PRAI-InGPS (taken as a group) to have an index of dissimilarity of approximately 10, whereas the other organisms had values intermediate. In addition, antiserum to E. coli tryptophan synthetase beta2 subunit was used in microcomplement fixation to extend the previous comparison of this subunit (Rocha, Crawford, and Mills, 1972) to E. carotovora and P. vulgaris. Indexes of dissimilarity for E. coli compared to P. vulgaris of E. carotovora were 1.0 and 1.7, respectively. Agar immunodiffusion using PRAI-Ingps antisera showed significant cross-reaction among E. coli, E. aerogenes, S. typhimurium, and P. vulgaris whereas the enzymes from S. marcescens and E. carotovora cross-reacted to a lesser extent, with the latter reaction being quite weak. Comparative enzyme neutralization using E. coli PRAI-InGPS antisera showed significant cross-reactions among the enzymes in that all were neutralized at least 25%. The data taken together indicate that the trpC gene products in the Enterobacteriaceae are a homologous group of proteins, that the genetic divergene of the trpC gene is basically the same as the trpA gene, and that both are less conserved than the trpB gene. Furthermore, the PRAI-InGPS, enzyme active site appears to represent a more evolutionarily conserved region of the protein. These findings indicate that, with respect to PRAI-InGPS, similarity to E. coli among the organisms examined is in the following order: (E. aerogenes, S. typhimurium, P. vulgaris) greater than (S. marcescens, E. carotovora).
TI  - Specific gonadotropin binding to Pseudomonas maltophilia.
AB  - Binding of 125I-labeled human chorionic gonadotropin to Pseudomonas maltophilia is dependent on time, temperature, and pH and the binding to this procaryotic species is hormone-specific and saturable. The equilibrium dissociation constant is 2.3 X 10(-9) M. There are no cooperative interactions between binding sites (Hill coefficient, 1.05). The number of sites is estimaated as 240 fmol/100 mug of protein. NaCl and KCl, at concentrations from 1 to 10 mM, have no effect on binding. Divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+) and 1 mM EDTA inhibit hormone binding. Binding is destroyed by heat or by treatment with Pronase of alpha-chymotrypsin and is increased by phospholipase C. Binding of the labeled gonadotropin is not observed with other gram-negative organisms--e.g., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas testosteroni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - [Preliminary tests of the influence of wastewaters from sugar-factories upon the  numbers of intestinal bacteria in water (author's transl)].
AB  - This work presents the results of experiments dealing with the influence of wastewaters from 2 sugar factories in the Czechoslovakia upon some representatives of intestinal bacteria: E. coli, C. feundii, E. aerogenes, S. anatum, S. schottmuelleri, S. typhi-murium, Sh. sonnei and Str. faecalis. The experiments were carried out at 30, 20 and 10 degrees C. The experiments have shown that the presterilized waste-water from sugar factory (in Bohemia and in Slovakia) caused rapid multiplication of the test-organisms: E. coli, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, S. anatum, S. schottmuelleri, S. typhi-murium, less by Sh. sonnei and Str. faecalis, at 30, 20 and 10 degrees C. The intensity of multiplication was direct proportional to the concentration of waste water and was effective to dilution 1:1000 (diluted with presterilized surface waters Vltava, Danube).
TI  - [Coliform bacteria in raw and pasteurized milk].
AB  - Studied were 360 samples of raw and 1404 samples of pasteurized milk, collected from three milk centers, for the presence of coliform bacteria. It was found that the coli titer of the raw milk varied from 10(-5) up to 10(-7), depending on the season. The regimes of pasteurization applied kill 100 per cent of the present coli organisms. After the thermic treatment the milk was additionally contaminated with coli forms from the containers and the equipment in dependence on the conditions of washing and disinfection. The coli titer of the pasteurized milk varied from 1 to 10(-3). A total of 602 strains of coliform bacteria were isolated from the pasteurized and the raw milk; the bacteria were differentiated by the scheme of Kauffmann. Most commonly encountered were the coli forms of the following genera:Citrobacter (35 per cent), Enterobacter (29.8 per cent), Klebsiella (23.9 per cent), and Escherichia (11.3 per cent). The following species were prevailing in raw milk: Kl. aerogenes, Ent. aerogenes, Ent. cloacae, C. freundi, and C. intermedium. In pasteurized milk dominating were Kl. aerogenes, C. freundi. Ent. aerogenes, and Ent. cloacae.
TI  - Coliforms from hides and meat.
AB  - Coliform tests were performed on 85 hide and 75 meat samples. IMViC reactions were determined on isolates from positive confirmed and fecal tests, and strains other than Escherichia coli were identified. Strains typed as Aerobacter aerogenes types I and II were identified as Enterobacter cloacae (51.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (21.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (15%), and Enterobacter liquefaciens, Serratia, and unidentified coliforms (12.1%). K. pneumoniae appeared to be responsible for less than 1% positive fecal tests.
TI  - [Infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with Klebsiella mastitis].
AB  - The infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of Klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. The following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from milk samples 28 and 31 times, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, Staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, Enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and Escherichia coli twice. The authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. Double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected Klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); However, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. The final deduction concerning the exogenic character of Klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.
TI  - In vitro growth inhibition of mastitis-causing coliform bacteria by bovine apo-lactoferrin and reversal of inhibition by citrate and high concentrations of apo-lactoferin.
AB  - Bovine apo-lactoferrin (apo-Lf) was added to in vitro cultures of eight strains of coliform bacteria associated with bovine mastitis. As little as 0.02 mg of APO-Lf per ml resulted in marked inhibition of growth of all coliforms. Growth inhibition was lost if saturated Lf or iron plus apo-Lf was added to the synthetic medium. The inhibition of growth increased as the concentration of apo-Lf increased from 0.02 to 0.2 mg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae (OARDC-A1), Klebsiella spp. (K1-21), and Aerobacter aerogenes (55-12222) and 2 mg/ml for A. aerogenes (76-2414-1), Escherichia coli (60-Lilly), E. coli (66-S16), and Klebsiella spp. (K6-24). As the concentration of apo-Lf was increased above 0.2 or 2 mg/ml, there was less inhibition of growth except for E. coli (33-C4). Apo-Lf at 20 mg/ml was bactericidal for E. coli (33-C4). Results are compatible with the hypothesis that coliform bacteria respond to low-iron environments by production of iron-sequestering agents that complete effectively with apo-Lf for free iron. Addition of apo-Lf plus citrate resulted in loss of growth inhibition. The molar ratio (citrate to apo-Lf) was found to be more important than the absolute concentration of either component. A ratio of 75 resulted in 50% growth inhibition, whereas ratios of 300 and greater resulted in less than 10% growth inhibition. These results suggest that the ratio of citrate to Lf would be important in evaluating Lf as a nonspecific protective factor of bovine mammary secretions.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - Acetylene reduction (nitrogen fixation) by enterobacteriaceae isolated from paper mill process waters.
AB  - Using selective media containing galactitol, over 130 Enterobacteriaceae have been isolated from paper mill process waters collected from different localities. These bacteria were extensively characterized and tested for acetylene-reducing (nitrogen-fixing) activity under anaerobic conditions. High activity was found in representatives of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Erwinia herbicola, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter intermedius, and Escherichia coli. Under argon, nitrogenase synthesis was generally not repressed by 5 mM l-glutamate, l-aspartate, l-leucine or Casamino Acids (0.5 g/liter). In many strains, both the specific activities (nanomoles of C(2)H(4) per minute per milligram of protein) and the activities (nanomoles of C(2)H(4) per minute) had considerably declined after 24 h. In three selected strains, activity in intact cells grown under nitrogen was unaffected by the presence during assay of 10 mM l-amino acids or ammonium acetate. All of the strains examined were tolerant towards inactivation of nitrogen-fixing activity by 1.8% (vol/vol) oxygen during assay, and inactivation by up to 10% oxygen was partly reversible. Representatives of the six taxa synthesized nitrogenase in stirred aerobic cultures, though the protein concentrations attained were lower than under anaerobic conditions. It seems reasonable to suggest that under natural conditions, nitrogen fixation is able to contribute significantly to the nitrogen economy of the cells.
TI  - Comparison of activity of sisomicin and gentamicin in mouse protection tests with gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The efficacy of sisomicin and gentamicin was compared in mouse protection studies against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was no significant difference in mortality of the mice in any of the protocol groups when five different dosages of sisomicin and gentamicin given by three separate schedules were compared for each bacterial inoculum in each antibiotic protocol. The mean protective dose values of sisomicin were at least one-half those of gentamicin for each protocol against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Formation of crystalline deposits by several genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Several species of bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae formed crystalline materials containing calcium when grown in a defined culture medium. Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, and C. intermedius produced calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Edwardsiella tarda and Escherichia coli formed calcite III crystals, whereas Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens produced hydroxyapatite crystals. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with kidney stones, indicating that microorganisms may be involved in the enucleation process of kidney stone formation.
TI  - Kinetic properties of Serratia marcescens adenosine 5'-diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase.
AB  - The regulatory properties of partially purified adenosine 5'-diphosphate-(ADP) glucose pyrophosphorylase from two Serratia marcescens strains (ATCC 274 and ATCC 15365) have been studied. Slight or negligible activation by fructose-P2, pyridoxal-phosphate, or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) was observed. These compounds were previously shown to be potent activators of the ADPglucose pyrophosphorylases from the enterics, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia aurescens, Shigella dysenteriae, and Escherichia coli. Phosphoenolpyruvate stimulated the rate of ADPglucose synthesis catalyzed by Serratia ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase about 1.5- to 2-fold but did not affect the S0.5 values (concentration of substrate required for 50% maximal stimulation) of the substrates, alpha-glucose-1-phosphate, and adenosine 5'-triphosphate. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), a potent inhibitor of the enteric ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase, is an effective inhibitor of the S. marcescens enzyme. ADP also inhibits but is not as effective as AMP. Activators of the enteric enzyme counteract the inhibition caused by AMP. This is in contrast to what is observed for the S. marcescens enzyme. Neither phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose-diphosphate, pyridoxal-phosphate, NADPH, 3-phosphoglycerate, fructose-6-phosphate, nor pyruvate effect the inhibition caused by AMP. The properties of the S. marcescens HY strain and Serratia liquefaciens ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase were found to be similar to the above two S. marcescens enzymes with respect to activation and inhibition. These observations provide another example where the properties of an enzyme found in the genus Serratia have been found to be different from the properties of the same enzyme present in the enteric genera Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter.
TI  - Regulation of enzyme formation in Klebsiella aerogenes by episomal glutamine synthetase of Escherichia coli.
AB  - We studied the physiology of cells of Klebsiella aerogenes containing the structural gene for glutamine synthetase (glnA) of Escherichia coli on an episome. The E. coli glutamine synthetase functioned in cells of K. aerogenes in a manner similar to that of the K. aerogenes enzyme: it allowed the level of histidase to increase and that of glutamate dehydrogenase to decrease during nitrogen-limited growth. The phenotype of mutations in the glnA site was restored to normal by the introduction of the episomal glnA+ gene. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that glutamine synthetase regulates the function of its own structural gene.
TI  - Glutamate dehydrogenase: genetic mapping and isolation of regulatory mutants of Klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  - The gene for glutamate dehydrogenase (gdhD) has been mapped in Klebsiella aerogenes by P1 transduction. It is linked to pyrF and trp with the order pyrF-trp-gdh. Complementation analysis using F' episomes from Escherichia coli suggests an analogous location in E. coli. Two mutants able to produce glutamate dehydrogenase in the presence of high levels of glutamine synthetase have been isolated. One, tightly linked to gdhD, shows normal repression control by glutamine synthetase but produces four times as much glutamate dehydrogenase activity as does the wild type under all conditions tested. The other revertant is not linked to gdhD or glnA.
TI  - Regulation of histidase synthesis in intergeneric hybrids of enteric bacteria.
AB  - Regulation of the expression of the histidase coded by hutk of Klebsiella aerogenes in Salmonella typhimurium and in Escherichia coli and of the expression of the histidase coded by huts of S. typhimurium in E. coli was investigated. The hutk histidase was found to be sensitive to catabolite repression in K. aerogenes and in E. coli, but insensitive to catabolite repression in S. typhimurium; huts histidase has previously been shown to be catabolite sensitive in all three organisms. The expression of both hutk and huts histidase in E. coli was activated by nitrogen starvation. Apparently, the glutamine synthetase of E. coli may activate the formation of some glutamate- and ammonia-producing enzymes.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefoxitin and cefamandole.
AB  - Cefoxitin and cefamandole were evaluated in vitro against 263 organisms. Studies  were performed in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth and agar employing inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) organisms per ml. At obtainable serum levels both antibiotics were bactericidal for nearly all strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus but were inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. In agar, cefamandole appeared to be active against most strains of Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus, whereas cefoxitin was active against indole-positive Proteus but not Enterobacter. Moreover, in broth medium most strains of Enterobacter were not readily inhibited by either antibiotic and only 40 and 73% of indole-positive Proteus were inhibited by 10 mug of cefamandole per ml in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth, respectively. However, in both broth media, 10 mug of cefoxitin per ml continued to be inhibitory and bactericidal for most isolates of indole-positive Proteus. Cefoxitin also was bactericidal against four cephalothin-resistant strains of E. coli. These data suggest that cefoxitin broadens the spectrum of existing cephalosporins by enhancing the activity against indole-positive Proteus species as well as some other Enterobacteriaceae. On the other hand, with the exception of strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, the apparent increased in vitro activity of cefamandole was demonstrated in agar and not in broth.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
TI  - The fate of bacteria in frozen red cells.
AB  - Units of blood were intentionally contaiminated with suspensions of either Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Sarcina lutea, Seratia marcesens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Paracolabacterum aerogenoides (Enterobacter hafriae), Mima polymorpha or Acinetobacter- calcoaceticus. When inoculation was made prior to glycerolization, the subsequent glycerolization, freezing, thawing, and deglycerolization resulted in roughly a two log reduction in the number of bacteria. When inoculation was made with a final concentration of between 10(1) and 10(5) organisms per milliliter, immediately following deglycerolization or following washing without glycerolization and freezing, no increase in the number of bacteria was seen after 72 hours storage at 4 C. Three of the 12 organisms studied decreased in number during 72 hours of storage. These data suggest that the current 24-hour limit on the post-thaw storage of frozen red blood cells may be unnecessarily restrictive.
TI  - Discrimination of Rhizobium japonicum, Rhizobium lupini, Rhizobium trifolii, Rhizobium leguminosarum and of bacteroids by uptake of 2-ketoglutaric acid, glutamic acid and phosphate.
AB  - Rhizobium strains (one each of Rh. japonicum, Rh. lupini, Rh. leguminosarum) take up 2-ketoglutaric acid in general much faster and from lower concentrations in the medium than strains of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Chromobacterium violaceum. A strain of Enterobacter aerogenes, however, is more similar to some Rhizobium strains. The same strains of Rhizobium take up also phosphate much faster and from lower concentrations than the other bacteria tested. 4 strains of Rh. lupini proved to be significantly different from 4 strains of Rh. trifolii in taking up L-glutamic acid from three to ten times lower concentration within 5 h. A similar difference was noticed between 5 strains of Rh. leguminosarum and 2 strains of Rh. japonicum for the uptake of 2-ketoglutaric acid and of L-glutamic acid. Isolated bacteroids from nodules of Glycine max var. Chippeway have a reduced uptake capacity for glutamic acid and for 2-ketoglutaric acid during the first 10-12 h, but reach the same value after 24 h as free living Rh. japonicum cells. The differences in the uptake kinetics are independent of cell concentration. The group II Rhizobium strains (Rh. japonicum and Rh. lupini, slow growing Rhizobium) are characterized by a rapid uptake of glutamic acid to a low remaining concentration of 1-3 X 10(-7) M and an uptake of 2-ketoglutaric acid to a remaining concentration of 2-5 X 10(-7) M. The group I Rhizobium strains (Rh. trifolii and Rh. leguminosarum, fast growing Rhizobium), can be characterized by a much slower uptake of both substances with a more than ten times higher concentration of both metabolites remaining in the medium after the same time.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of bovine neonatal serums for selected coliform bacteria in relation to total protein and immunoglobulin G1 and immunoglobulin M concentrations.
AB  - Bactericidal activity for a serum-sensitive Aerobacter aerogenes strain was associated with antibodies present in immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), with the greatest activity on a weight basis in IgM. Activity in immunoglobulin G2 was absent. A total of 118 serums were prepared from blood collected from neonatal calves on farms experiencing unusually high mortality from diarrhea. The serums were allotted to 4 groups on the basis of total serum protein concentrations as follows: group I=7.0 to 9.5 g/dl, group II=6.00 to 6.98 g/dl, group III=5.00 to 5.90 g/dl, and group IV=3.9 to 4.9 g/dl. Bactericidal activity for the serum-sensitive aerobacter strain was distributed approximately equally throughout the 4 groups. Activity for 3 strains of Escherichia coli was minimal to absent. Concentrations of IgG1 and IgM were determined in 82 of the serums. Concentrations of IgG1 ranged from 0 to 54.2 mg/ml, with overlapping among the 4 groups. Concentrations of IgM could not be determined in serums with concentrations greater than 1.6 mg/ml. However, bactericidal activity did not correlate with the immunoglobulin concentrations, since activity was present to the same degree in serums with small concentrations of immunoglobulins compared with serums with as much as threefold larger concentrations.
TI  - Transduction of chromosomal genes between enteric bacteria by bacteriophage P1.
AB  - We have used P1 transduction to create intergeneric hybrid strains of enteric bacteria by moving the genA and hut genes between Klebsiella aerogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The use of E. coli as the recipient in such transductions permits the construction of episomes and specialized transducing phage containing non-E. coli material. The effect of host restriction modification and deoxyribonucleic acid homology on the frequency of intergeneric transduction of these loci has been examined.
TI  - Diminished effect of gentamicin under anaerobic or hypercapnic conditions.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of gentamicin, judged by M.I.C. determinations, was much reduced when a normal aerobic atmosphere was replaced either by air +4% CO2 or by anaerobic conditions. The phenomenon was greatest for Staphylococcus aureus, where a decrease in activity of up to 20-fold was found. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter spp., and Proteus spp. the factor of decrease was between 15-fold and 2-5-fold. Changes in medium pH, as a result of bacterial growth, can explain these findings for some, but not all, the species tested.
TI  - Construction of intergeneric hybrids using bacteriophage P1CM: transfer of the Klebsiella aerogenes ribitol dehydrogenase gene to Escherichia coli.
AB  - Study of many of the interesting properties of Klebsiella aerogenes is limited by the lack of a well-characterized genetic system for this organism. Our investigations of the evolution of the enzyme ribitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.56) in K. aerogenes would be greatly facilitated by the availability of such a system, and we here report two approaches to developing one. We have isolated mutants sensitive to the coliphage P1, which will efficiently tranduce genetic markers between such sensitive strains and which will thus make detailed mapping studies possible. Derivatives of K. aerogenes lysogenic for P1 can be readily isolated by using the specialized transducing particle P1CMclr100. Bacteria lysogenic for this phage are chloramphenicol resistant and temperature sensitive. Phage particles produced by temperature induction of such lysogens can be used to transfer K. aerogenes genes to the natural host of P1 phage. Escherichia coli. We have used this method to prepare derivatives of E. coli K-12 carrying the K. aerogenes genes conferring the ability to metabolize the pentitols ribitol and D-arabitol. We have shown that these E. coli-K. aerogenes hybrids synthesize a ribitol dehydrogenase with the properties of the K. aerogenes enzyme and have mapped the position of the transferred gene on the E. coli chromosome. The ramifications of this methodology are discussed.
TI  - [Characterization by zymograms of R factor-determined beta-lactamases: plasmids of defined and undefined compatibility groups (author's transl)].
AB  - An easy biochemical method is described, discriminating the beta-lacta-mases coded by various R factors. Electrophoretic mobility and substrate affinity of beta-lactamases were studied simultaneously for 7 different penicillins and cephalosporins. They are I like R factors assigned into different compatibility groups (N, P, com6, com7, com8, X and com 9), five R factors isolated from piglets faeces and one R factor, RU1, originated from Enterobacter aerogenes. Three electrophoretic types of beta-lactamases were determinated: 1) beta-lactamase which migrates towards the anode (enzyme coded by Bacillus cereus chromosome); 2) beta-lactamase of weak cathodic mobility (e. g. R6K); 3) beta-lactamase which migrates rapidly towards the cathode (e. g. R46, R71). Escherichia coli K12 strains synthesize a penicillinase of this third type, destroying penicillin G. The enzymatic and physicochemical properties are not modified by host bacteria, suggesting the possibility to study the plasmid in wild bacteria.
TI  - Dense growth of aerobic bacteria in a bench-scale fermentor.
AB  - Escherichia coli B, Escherichia coli MRE 600, Escherichia coli K 12-3300, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Aerobacter aerogenes were grown exponentially in a bench-scale fermentor to cell concentrations in the range of 20 to 41 g dry cells/liter at 30 degrees C and 30 to 55 g dry cells/liter at 25 degrees C. The high cell concentrations were achieved in a growth system previously described for growth of Escherichia coli W (Biotechnol. Bioeng., 16, 933 (1974); ibid. 17, 227 (1975)). Various enzyme activity levels in the high-concentration cells were compared to those in cells grown in conventional low-density cultures. No significant differences were found. The culture supernatants were found to be essentially free of high-molecular weight metabolic or cell lysis products. Yield constants for glucose, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus were also determined in the dense cultures and some of their relations to the growth conditions are discussed.
TI  - Expression of the hut operons of Salmonella typhimurium in Klebsiella aerogenes and in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The normal hut (histidine utilization) operons, as well as those with mutations affecting the regulation of their expression, of Salmonella typhimurium were introduced on an F' episome into cells of S. typhimurium and Klebsiella aerogenes whose chromosomal hut genes had been deleted and into cells of Escherichia coli, whose chromosome does not carry hut genes. The episomal hut operons respond in a manner very similar to induction and catabolite repression in all three organisms. The small differences found reflect both different abilities to take up inducers from the medium and different degrees of catabolite repression exerted by glucose.
TI  - Thin-layer chromatographic technique for rapid detection of bacterial phospholipases.
AB  - Silica gel thin-layer chromatography was employed to detect lecithinase activity  induced from bacterial resting cell preparations induced from bacterial resting cell preparations incubated at 37 C for 4 h in the presence of purified egg yolk lecithin. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa hydrolyzed lecithin with the formation of free fatty acids as the sole lipid-soluble product. In none of the Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii strains tested could lecithinase activity be detected. Four among eight strains of Enterobacter aerogenes and one among 12 strains of Proteus tested produced negligible amounts of free fatty acid.
TI  - Growth rate of Enterobacteriaceae at elevated temperatures: limitation by methionine.
AB  - The effect of elevated temperatures on growth rate was studied in five strains of Enterobacteriaceae. In all the strains tested a shift to the elevated temperature resulted in an immediate decrease in growth rate which was due to limitation in the availability of endogenous methionine. The first biosynthetic enzyme of the methionine pathway-homoserine transsuccinylase-was studied in extracts of Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and Escherichia coli and was shown to be temperature sensitive in all of them.
TI  - Susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to combinations of antimicrobial agents in vitro.
AB  - Combinations of either clindamycin or erythromycin with gentamicin, colimycin, or carbenicillin were studied for their antimicrobial effects on clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No antagonistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were observed. Synergistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were noted against most strains of E. coli tested, especially when either clindamycin or erythromycin was combined with gentamicin or colimycin. Of 16 other combinations of antibiotics examined with strains of E. coli as the test organisms, only the combination of penicillin G with either gentamicin or colimycin showed consistent synergy. The marked synergy of clindamycin combined with either gentamicin or colimycin was further demonstrated by following the kinetics of the bactericidal action of the antibiotic combinations and the effects on bacterial protein synthesis.
TI  - The effects of feeding tetracycline, nitrovin and quindoxin on the drug-resistance of coli-aerogenes bacteria from calves and pigs.
TI  - Herd studies on coliform mastitis.
AB  - Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for 63, 10, and 11 percent, respectively, of 158 coliform organisms recovered from mastitis cases in 8 California herds. The severity and nature of the coliform mastitis problem were found to vary greatly among herds but were characteristic for each of 4 herds studied in detail.
TI  - Reversible inactivation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli ML308 during growth on acetate.
AB  - During aerobic growth of Escherichia coli ML308 on acetate as sole carbon source, the apparent synthesis of isocitrate dehydrogenase was repressed relative to cultures on other carbon sources, such as glucose, which do not employ the glyoxylate bypass as an anaplerotic sequence. When cells were removed from an acetate medium, or when compounds were added which made the operation of the glyoxylate bypass unnecessary, the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase rapidly increased 3- to 4-fold but fell again on restoration to an acetate medium. Changes in activity were rapid and, furthermore, could be demonstrated in the absence of protein synthesis. It is thus improbable that the mechanism involved degradation or de novo synthesis of the enzyme protein. Oxaloacetate and glyoxylate showed concerted inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase which could be relieved by dialysis. Because extracts of low enzyme activity, derived from acetate-metabolizing cells, could not be stimulated by dialysis or by addition of a wide range of metabolites, it is unlikely that low molecular weight, freely dissociable effectors were responsible for stimulation or inhibition of activity. Control of isocitrate dehydrogenase permitted the efficient utilization of acetate as sole source of carbon and energy but perserved the capacity of the cell to respond rapidly to an improvement in nutritional conditions. A limited survey showed that the mechanism is common but not universal among strains of E. coli and occurs in at least one strain each of Klebsiella aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Improved large-volume sampler for the collection of bacterial cells from aerosol.
AB  - A modified large-volume sampler was demonstrated to be an efficient device for the collection of mono-disperse aerosols of rhodamine B and poly-disperse aerosols of bacterial cells. Absolute efficiency for collection of rhodamine B varied from 100% with 5-mum particles to about 70% with 0.5-mum particles. The sampler concentrated the particles from 950 liters of air into a flow of between 1 and 2 ml of collecting fluid per min. Spores of Bacillus subtilis var. niger were collected at an efficiency of about 82% compared to the collection in the standard AGI-30 sampler. In the most desirable collecting fluids tested, aerosolized cells of Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, and Aerobacter aerogenes were collected at comparative efficiencies of approximately 90, 80, and 90%, respectively. The modified sampler has practical application in the study of aerosol transmission of respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial biotin-proteins.
AB  - The biotin-protein populations in several bacterial strains were analyzed by solubilization of [3H]biotin-labeled cells with sodium dodecylsulfate followed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing the detergent. A variety of patterns of biotin-labeled polypeptide chains was seen, ranging from a single biotin-protein in Escherichia coli, corresponding to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein component of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, to multiple species in Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas citronellolis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium shermanii, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Mycobacterium phlei, which probably represent subunits of multiple biotin-dependent enzymes present in these organisms. In the case of Pseudomonas citronellolis two major biotin-containing polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 65 000 and 25 000 were shown to correspond to the biotin carboxyl carrier components of pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, respectively. Thus in the case of Pseudomonas citronellolis two different biotin-dependent enzymes in the same cell do not share common biotin carboxyl carrier subunits.
TI  - Glutamine-binding subunit of glutamate synthase and partial reactions catalyzed by this glutamine amidotransferase.
AB  - In the course of studies on glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase from Aerobacter aerogenes, we purified another protein which was found to be glutamate synthase (EC 2.6.1.53). The enzyme, obtained in apparently homogeneous form (monomer molecular weight about 227,000; s(20,omega) = 17.6 S), was found to be a typical glutamine amidotransferase in that it exhibits glutaminase activity and can utilize ammonia in place of glutamine as a nitrogen donor. The enzyme also catalyzes at low rates the oxidative deamination of glutamate in the presence of TPN, and it exhibits TPNH oxidase activity. The enzyme is similar to the glutamate synthase found in Escherichia coli in that it is an iron-sulfide flavoprotein. Treatment of the enzyme with sodium dodecyl sulfate or potassium thiocyanate dissociates it into nonidentical subunits exhibiting molecular weights of about 175,000 and 51,500. The glutamine-dependent activity of the enzyme is inhibited by L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid, but this chloroketone analog of glutamine does not affect the ammonia-dependent glutamate synthase activity. Studies with [(14)C]chloroketone show that the reagent binds to the heavy subunit only. Inhibition by the chloroketone and its binding to the heavy subunit are markedly reduced in the presence of L-glutamine. Sedimentation velocity studies carried out in potassium thiocyanate indicate that iron-sulfide and flavin sites are also located on the heavy subunit. While these studies show that glutamate synthase resembles other glutamine amidotransferases in certain of its catalytic properties, the findings indicate that the light subunit of this enzyme, in contrast to that of several other glutamine amidotransferases, does not function to bind glutamine. It is of interest that the enzyme exhibits an unusually high affinity for ammonia as compared to a number of other glutamine amidotransferases. Glutamate synthase is inhibited (competitively with respect to glutamine) by low concentrations of methionine sulfone, methionine sulfoximine, and methionine sulfoxide.
TI  - Newer aminoglycosides--amikacin and tobramycin: an in-vitro comparison with kanamycin and gentamicin.
AB  - Tobramycin and amikacin are new aminoglycoside antibiotics which resemble gentamicin and kanamycin respectively in pharmacokinetic, toxicological, and some microbiological respects. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for these four antibiotics have been determined against 393 bacterial strains (13 species from eight genera) isolated from clinical materialKanamycin was the least active, 89% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains being resistant. Resistance was also found in 21% of the Klebsiella aerogenes, 16% of the indoleproducing Proteus species, 4% of the E. coli and 3% of the Enterobacter spp. tested. Providenca stuartii strains were often resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin.Apart from these exceptions, however, all the organisms tested were sensitive to all four compounds, gentamicin and tobramycin usually showing the highest intrinsic activity.Amikacin was the most active compound against a selection of strains chosen because of their resistance to one or more of the aminoglycosides. Thus, amikacin represents a significant advance over kanamycin and seems to be superior to gentamicin in terms of its in-vitro properties. This is especially the case in those unusual circumstances when gentamicin-resistant strains are a problem. We suggest that amikacin warrants further investigation since it may prove to be a valuable alternative to gentamicin in the treatment of life-threatening infections.
TI  - Cefamandole, a cephalosporin antibiotic with an unusually wide spectrum of activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefamandole, 7-d-mandelamido-3-(1 methyl-1H-tetrazol-5 yethiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 carboxylic acid, was investigated. The majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. Activity against Staphylococcus aureus was below that of cephalothin, but most strains were inhibited by 0.4 mug/ml. Enterococci were not inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. Cefamandole was very active against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, with 70% of Escherichia coli, 86% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 88% of Proteus mirabilis inhibited by 1.6 mug/ml. A number of Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens strains were inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. Pseudomonas species were resistant. Cefamandole was more active than cephalothin, cephaloridine, or cephalexin against members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Inoculum size and type of medium had variable effects on the minimal inhibitory concentration, depending upon the particular strain tested. Strains of Enterobacter, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus species showed the greatest inoculum effect. Similarly, these species showed a several-fold difference of bactericidal and inhibitory levels. Resistance of cefamandole to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamase played a partial role in its activity, but some strains that hydrolyzed the agent were susceptible.
TI  - Evaluating the membrane fecal coliform test by using Escherichia coli as the indicator organism.
AB  - The fecal coliform membrane filter method (MFC) currently used in water pollution analysis was evaluated by using two strains of Escherichia coli, a known fecal coliform, as the indicator organism. A large relative error in the results obtained with this method was found to be dependent upon the brand of membrane filter employed, the medium, and the temperature of incubation. MFC densities varied between 10 and 60% of the densities determined by means of total bacteria counts and total coliform counts performed at 35 C. Due to the large relative error encountered, the MFC method cannot be recommended as an analytical tool for the laboratory enumeration of E. coli. The results do show that the MFC method can be used at 35 C for enumeration of E. coli and for differential counts of E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes.
TI  - Amino-terminal sequence of the tryptophan synthetase alpha chain of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The sequence of the 46 NH(2)-terminal residues of the tryptophan synthetase alpha chain of Bacillus subtilis was determined and compared with the corresponding sequences of Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Aerobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas putida. A deletion of six residues was found at the NH(2)-terminal end of the alpha chain of B. subtilis.
TI  - Procaryote phylogeny. I. Concerning the relatedness of Aerobacter aerogenes to Escherichia coli.
TI  - Pressure transducer method for measuring gas production by microorganisms.
AB  - A simple method for measuring gas production by microorganisms by using a pressure transducer to sense pressure buildup was developed and tested with members of the coliform group. The test system consisted of a 5.0 lb/in(2) pressure transducer and a pressure equalizer valve attached to the metal cap of a test tube (20 by 150 mm); gas pressure was recorded on a strip-chart recorder. Gas pressure response curves consisted of (i) a lag period with no marked increase in pressure, (ii) a rapid pressure buildup period, and (iii) a leveling-off period. A linear relationship was established between inoculum size and length of the lag period. Cultures shaken at 200 oscillations/min showed a marked increase in rate of gas release over stationary cultures. Cell concentrations at the time of rapid buildup in pressure were 10(8)/ml. Mean maximum pressure recordings, lb/in(2) per 10 ml of broth, were: Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.70; Citrobacter intermedium, 2.70; and Escherichia coli, 2.10. Mean CO(2) concentrations, ppm of headspace gas, for E. coli were: (i) 2,000 at time of inoculation, (ii) 25,000 at time of rapid buildup in pressure, and (iii) 150,000 at maximum pressure. These results indicate the potential application of the pressure transducer method for rapidly detecting coliforms and other gas-producing microorganisms in clinical samples and in sterility testing of foods.
TI  - Methods for visualization of enzymes in polyacrylamide gels.
AB  - White bands resulting from precipitation of dodecan-1-ol liberated by hydrolysis  of sodium dodecyl sulfate and decan-5-ol released by hydrolysis of decan-5-yl sulfate produced zymograms of the primary and secondary alkylsulfatases from Pseudomonas C(12)B. Gas-liquid chromatographic analyses of ether extracts of the precipitate-containing segments of the zymograms confirmed the identity of the alcohols which were not discerned in extracts of segments of the gels other than those containing precipitates. beta-Galactosidase from Escherichia coli was marked on zymograms by the liberation of o-nitrophenol from o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside, and arylsulfatase from Pseudomonas C(12)B was marked in gels by liberation of p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl sulfate. Membrane-associated dissimilatory nitrate reductases from a nitrate respirer (Enterobacter aerogenes) and a denitrifier (Pseudomonas perfectomarinus) did not penetrate either 6.8 or 3% polyacrylamide gel but were demonstrable at the top of the gels. In the membrane-bound state, formate served as electron donor for nitrate reductase from E. aerogenes, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) served as donor for nitrate reductase from P. perfectomarinus. Both enzymes reduced nitrate at the expense of reduced benzyl viologen as well. Assimilatory nitrate reductase from E. aerogenes moved easily into the 6.8% gels (R(f) = 0.43 under the conditions of these experiments). The reduced dye served as electron donor for the assimilatory reductase, but formate and NADH did not. Incubation of the membrane-associated nitrate reductases with 2% Triton X-100 solubilized the enzymes and removed the capacity of formate and NADH to serve as electron donors. Both retained the ability to reduce nitrate at the expense of reduced benzyl viologen. The solubilized dissimilatory reductase from E. aerogenes moved further in the gels (R(f) = 0.49) than the soluble assimilatory reductase; the solubilized dissimilatory reductase from the denitrifier, P. perfectomarinus, moved further in the gels (R(f) = 0.64) than either of the enzymes from E. aerogenes.
TI  - An extended phage growth cycle in T4 infected A. aerogenes.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence divergence in the -chain-structural genes of tryptophan synthetase from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Aerobacter aerogenes.
AB  - Two different estimates were obtained for the extent of nucleotide sequence divergence in the structural genes of the tryptophan synthetase alpha-chains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Aerobacter aerogenes. One estimate was based on comparisons of the amino acid sequences of the respective alpha chains. The other was derived from measurements of the thermal stability of RNA-DNA hybrids formed with phage DNA carrying the alpha-chain structural gene of E. coli and labeled messenger RNA from the three bacterial species. Comparison of the two estimates suggests that during the course of evolution synonymous codon changes have accumulated in the alpha-chain-structural genes.
TI  - Amino acid sequence studies with the tryptophan synthetase chain of Aerobacter aerogenes.
TI  - Anthranilate synthase-anthranilate 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase from Aerobacter aerogenes.
AB  - 1. Anthranilate synthase and phosphoribosyltransferase from Aerobacter aerogenes  purify simultaneously and sediment together on sucrose gradients, showing that they occur as an enzyme aggregate. Both activities of the intact aggregate are subject to inhibition by tryptophan. 2. By using appropriate auxotrophic mutants it was shown that an intact active enzyme aggregate is formed when the components come from separate mutant strains. An intact active aggregate can also be formed when one component is from Escherichia coli and the other from A. aerogenes. 3. Phosphoribosyltransferase of A. aerogenes is active when not in an aggregate with anthranilate synthase, but is not subject to tryptophan inhibition, indicating that the inhibitor site is on the anthranilate synthase component. 4. Anthranilate synthase can be active and sensitive to tryptophan inhibition when complexed with an inactive phosphoribosyltransferase. 5. Kinetic studies on the anthranilate synthase activity show that tryptophan is a competitive inhibitor with respect to chorismate and a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to either glutamine or NH(4) (+) ions. This is consistent with a sequential mechanism of the ordered type in which chorismate is the first reactant.
TI  - Enterobacteria in feedlot waste and runoff.
AB  - Samples of beef cattle feedlot waste (FLW), runoff from the pens, and water from  a large drainage ditch at the feedlot were examined for Enterobacteriaceae. The drainage ditch receives the runoff but contains primarily subsurface drainage from fields on which FLW is spread for disposal. Planting and enrichment techniques with seven different media were used to isolate 553 cultures of enterobacteria. FLW contains about 50 million enterobacteria/g dry weight. More than 90% of these were Escherichia coli, none of which were enteropathogenic types as determined with multivalent sera. Citrobacter and Enterobacter cloacae were other organisms present in moderate numbers. Application of enrichment techniques broadened the spectrum of enterobacteria isolates to include the four Proteus spp., both Providencia spp., Klebsiella, Enterobacter aerogenes, Arizona, and a single isolate of Salmonella (serological group C(2)). Shigella was not isolated. The wide spectrum of enterobacteria in FLW may be a hazard if unsterilized waste is refed. Fewer enterobacteria occurred in the runoff and in the drainage ditch; the most numerous species in FLW also were most numerous at these sites. However, neither Salmonella nor Arizona was isolated from runoff or drainage-ditch waters.
TI  - Butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  - Butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. Butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.
TI  - Enteric bacterial growth rates in river water.
AB  - Enteric bacteria, including stocked strains of pathogenic species and organisms naturally present in the stream, were capable of growth in a chemostat with autoclaved river water taken 750 m below a sewage outfall. Maximal specific growth rates for all organisms occurred at 30 C, whereas culture generation times ranged between 33.3 and 116 hr. Of the six laboratory strains of enteric species used, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes grew at generation times of 34.5 and 33.3 hr, respectively, while the remaining Proteus, Arizona, Salmonella, and Shigella spp. reproduced at a rate two to three times slower than the coliforms. Little or no growth occurred in the water at incubation temperatures of 20 and 5 C, and death was observed for Salmonella senftenberg at 20 and 5 C and for E. aerogenes and Proteus rettgeri at 5 C. When enteric bacteria naturally present in the river water were employed in similar experiments, coliform bacteria demonstrated a generation time of approximately 116 hr, whereas fecal coliforms failed to grow. Growth of the bacteria from the river demonstrated a periodicity of approximately 100 hr, which suggests that much of the growth of these organisms in the chemostat may be on the glass surfaces. This phenomenon, however, was not observed with any of the stocked enteric species. Neither the stock cultures nor the aquatic strains were capable of growth in autoclaved river water taken above the sewage outfall at the three temperatures tested.
TI  - Comparative immunological and enzymatic study of the tryptophan synthetase beta 2 subunit in the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The beta(2) subunits of tryptophan synthetase, formula alpha(2)beta(2), from Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and Serratia marcescens were compared by three criteria. (i) alphabeta association constants for the various beta(2) subunits and E. coli alpha subunit varied between 3.6 x 10(8)m(-1) for E. coli and 0.33 x 10(8)m(-1) for S. marcescens; values for the other organisms were intermediate. (ii) Antiserum neutralization of the beta(2) subunit enzyme activity using anti-E. coli beta(2) serum showed significant cross-reaction among the organisms (E. coli, 1.0; S. dysenteriae, 0.98; S. typhimurium, 0.67; E. aerogenes, 0.61; S. marcescens, 0.42). (iii) Quantitative microcomplement fixation showed E. coli beta(2) and S. marcescens beta(2) subunits to have an index of dissimilarity of 1.8 while the other organisms had intermediate indexes. Similar complement fixation data were obtained with antisera from separate rabbits and from first course and boost sera. These findings suggest that the general surface structure and the respective alpha subunit binding site of the beta(2) subunits from these Enterobacteriaceae have been strongly conserved.
TI  - Micro-complement fixation in Klebsiella classification.
AB  - The alkaline phosphatases of 29 strains of bacteria assigned by various authors to the genera Aerobacter, Klebsiella and Enterobacter were compared by the micro-complement fixation technique. On the basis of phosphatase resemblance, we recommend that all strains hitherto assigned to Aerobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter aerogenes be assigned to the genus Klebsiella.
TI  - The metabolism of D-arabinose: alternate kinases for the phosphorylation of D-ribulose in Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes.
TI  - Isolation of a polyvalent bacteriophage for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Aerobacter aerogenes.
AB  - A lytic bacteriophage isolated from sewage was found to attack strains of Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but not members of the genera Salmonella, Proteus, and Serratia. The phage, designated phimp, contained deoxyribonucleic acid with a 50% guanine plus cytosine ratio and a molecular weight of 23.1 x 10(6) daltons. Single-step growth experiments of phimp plated at 37 C on A. aerogenes A2 gave a mean latent period of 20 min, an average burst size of 103 plaque-forming units/infected cell, and an average adsorption rate constant of 3 x 10(-10) ml/min. Electron microscopy of phimp revealed a phage with a flexible tail (165 nm long and 6 nm wide). The phage head had a hexagonal outline (62 nm in diameter).
TI  - Trimethoprim resistance determined by R factors.
AB  - R factors conferring a high level of resistance to trimethoprim have been identified in one strain of Escherichia coli and one of Klebsiella aerogenes, both isolated from infected urines.
TI  - Studies on the relationship between the active sites of chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli or Aerobacter aerogenes.
TI  - Inhibition of the -lactamases of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella aerogenes by semi-synthetic penicillins.
AB  - 1. A new automated micro-iodometric method is described for screening compounds for inhibitory action against beta-lactamase enzymes. 2. Over 1000 semi-synthetic penicillins were tested for inhibitory activity against the beta-lactamase of Escherichia coli B11 and 18 showed a fractional inhibition similar to or higher than that of methicillin. 3. The best inhibitors were alkoxy- and halogen-substituted phenyl-, naphthyl- or quinolyl-penicillins. 2-Isopropoxy-1-naphthylpenicillin (BRL 1437) was clearly the best and had a K(i) value about 1% of that of methicillin. 4. The inhibition of the beta-lactamase of E. coli B11 by BRL 1437 was shown to be reversible and competitive. The K(i) was 0.004mum and K(i)/K(m) with ampicillin and p-hydroxyampicillin (BRL 2333) was about 0.0001. The K(m) and V(max.) values were determined for the beta-lactamases of E. coli B11 and Klebsiella aerogenes A against a variety of penicillins. Cell-bound and solubilized enzymes gave similar K(i) and K(m) values. 5. BRL 1437 was superior to cloxacillin and methicillin for inhibition of the beta-lactamase of live, fully grown cultures of several strains of E. coli and K. aerogenes. Of a group of inhibitors BRL 1437 was the most stable to the beta-lactamase of E. coli B11.
TI  - Phosphatase synthesis in Klebsiella (aerobacter) aerogenes growing in continuous  culture.
AB  - 1. Phosphatase synthesis was studied in Klebsiella aerogenes grown in a wide range of continuous-culture systems. 2. Maximum acid phosphatase synthesis was associated with nutrient-limited, particularly carbohydrate-limited, growth at a relatively low rate, glucose-limited cells exhibiting the highest activity. Compared with glucose as the carbon-limiting growth material, other sugars not only altered the activity but also changed the pH-activity profile of the enzyme(s). 3. The affinity of the acid phosphatase in glucose-limited cells towards p-nitrophenyl phosphate (K(m) 0.25-0.43mm) was similar to that of staphylococcal acid phosphatase but was ten times greater than that of the Escherichia coli enzyme. 4. PO(4) (3-)-limitation derepressed alkaline phosphatase synthesis but the amounts of activity were largely independent of the carbon source used for growth. 5. The enzymes were further differentiated by the effect of adding inhibitors (F(-), PO(4) (3-)) and sugars to the reaction mixture during the assays. In particular, it was shown that adding glucose, but not other sugars, stimulated the rate of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate by the acid phosphatase in carbohydrate-limited cells at low pH values (<4.6) but inhibited it at high pH values (>4.6). Alkaline phosphatase activity was unaffected. 6. The function of phosphatases in general is discussed and possible mechanisms for the glucose effect are outlined.
TI  - Changes in antibiotic sensitivity patterns of Gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  - Sensitivity tests with 12 antibiotics on 1,018 strains of Gram-negative bacilli isolated in a burns unit between 1969 and 1971 showed some important differences from results in similar tests on a series of strains isolated between 1965 and 1967. These changes included the emergence of a large proportion of kanamycin-resistant strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli and of smaller proportions of trimethoprim- and gentamicin-resistant strains; also the complete replacement of Proteus mirabilis with dissociated resistance to ampicillin by strains showing linked resistance to ampicillin and carbenicillin. The probable relationship of these changes to the emergence of an R factor determining resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin, carbenicillin, ampicillin, and cephaloridine in Enterobacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is discussed.
TI  - Some relationships between R-factor and chromosomal -lactamase in Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 1. The beta-lactamases specified by Klebsiella aerogenes 418 and the R-factor R-7268 have been partially purified. 2. The molecular weights of the K. aerogenes strains 418 and 373, Aerobacter cloacae 53, R-7268 and R-TEM beta-lactamases were all about 20000; that of the enzymes from Escherichia coli strains 419 and 214T was about 31000. 3. These enzymes were also compared by means of their K(m) values for benzylpenicillin and ampicillin, and their behaviour on starch-gel electrophoresis. 4. The beta-lactamases specified by the two Klebsiella strains, the Aerobacter strain, and the R-factors R-TEM and R-7268 were found to comprise a broadly similar group. However, within this group, only two enzymes seemed to be identical, namely those specified by the two R-factors. The two E. coli strains produce identical beta-lactamases which are very different from the ;Klebsiella/Aerobacter-type' enzymes.
TI  - Biotin production and utilization in a sewage treatment lagoon.
AB  - Biotin, in a sewage oxidation lagoon also receiving potato processing wastes, was observed to increase two logs during the summer period of waste stabilization and then to decline to near earlier concentrations. Three organisms, Aerobacter aerogenes, Chlorella vulgaris, and Thiocapsa floridana, were at least partially responsible for these fluctuations; the latter two organisms were associated with biotin utilization and the former with biotin production. Since copious quantities of biotin are produced in these waste treatment facilities, the vitamin may act as a useful indicator of microbial action on certain organic molecules, especially in domestic and industrial wastes such as those from municipalities and potato and sugar beet processing plants. Furthermore, the presence of biotin in rivers and streams may be indicative of the discharge of incompletely stabilized wastes from these sources.
TI  - [Transfer of colicinogenic factors from Escherichia coli to Aerobacter aerogenes].
TI  - Serum Bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Serum bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. Bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. Reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. Four of six different strains, including the propagating S. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. All six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. Active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. In contrast to sensitive S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella montevideo, S. zymogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. Among gram-positive bacteria, only D. pneumoniae inhibited S. aureus bacteriostasis. Agglutinins of S. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for S. aureus serum bacteriostasis. After diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins A, G, and M appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. It is suggested that S. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.

TI  - N-Acetylanthranilic acid biosynthesis in Aerobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Experimental technique for studying aerosols of lyophilized bacteria.
AB  - An experimental technique is presented for studying aerosols generated from lyophilized bacteria by using Escherichia coli B, Bacillus subtilis var. niger, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pasteurella tularensis. An aerosol generator capable of creating fine particle aerosols of small quantities (10 mg) of lyophilized powder under controlled conditions of exposure to the atmosphere is described. The physical properties of the aerosols are investigated as to the distribution of number of aerosol particles with particle size as well as to the distribution of number of bacteria with particle size. Biologically unstable vegetative cells were quantitated physically by using (14)C and Europium chelate stain as tracers, whereas the stable heat-shocked B. subtilis spores were assayed biologically. The physical persistence of the lyophilized B. subtilis aerosol is investigated as a function of size of spore-containing particles. The experimental result that physical persistence of the aerosol in a closed aerosol chamber increases as particle size is decreased is satisfactorily explained on the bases of electrostatic, gravitational, inertial, and diffusion forces operating to remove particles from the particular aerosol system. The net effect of these various forces is to provide, after a short time interval in the system (about 2 min), an aerosol of fine particles with enhanced physical stability. The dependence of physical stability of the aerosol on the species of organism and the nature of the suspending medium for lyophilization is indicated. Also, limitations and general applicability of both the technique and results are discussed.

TI  - Gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  - In a period of two years, 865 strains of Gram-negative bacilli other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. The commonest species were Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. Many strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Bacterium anitratum were also found.A large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. The proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. A large proportion of the strains of E. coli and P. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. Multiple resistance occurred less often among strains of E. coli than among Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, and P. mirabilis. Phage and serological typing of Ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. Taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with Ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.
TI  - Taxonomic investigations on expressed and cryptic phospho-beta-glucosidases in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - In the Enterobacteriaceae, beta-glucosides are catabolized by a complex system formed of three permeases, with partly overlapping substrate specificities, and two hydrolytic enzymes, phospho-beta-glucosidase A and B, which hydrolyze only phosphorylated beta-glucosides. Some Enterobacteriaceae such as Klebsiella-Aerobacter (Enterobacter) possess the complete system; others possess only parts of it or may have a cryptic phospho-beta-glucosidase activity without permease activity. A screening test applied to strains belonging to several genera of Enterobacteriaceae showed that strains of Citrobacter, Hafnia, and Serratia exhibit a degree of similarity in phospho-beta-glucosidase activity and inducibility which could be useful in their taxonomic characterization; others, such as Aerobacter aerogenes, Erwinia, and Proteus vulgaris, are more heterologous. Owing to the presence of inducible phospho-beta-glucosidases A and B in Citrobacter, the fermentation of beta-methyl glucoside and the fermentation of arbutin in mixture with cellobiose could be of diagnostic value in the differentiation of Citrobacter from Salmonella. Wild-type strains of Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Salmonella are phenotypically similar in their inability to catabolize beta-glucosides, the presence of constitutive P-beta-glucosidase A, and the lack of beta-glucoside permeases I and II. Their beta-glucoside-fermenting mutants show, however, a phospho-beta-glucosidase and beta-glucoside permease activity which is characteristic for mutants from each genus. The differences in the phenotype of the mutants reflect probable differences in the presence of cryptic genes in the wild-type strains and could be of evolutionary significance.
TI  - Organization of enzymes in the polyaromatic synthetic pathway: separability in bacteria.
AB  - ULTRACENTRIFUGATION IN SUCROSE DENSITY GRADIENTS WAS EMPLOYED TO ESTIMATE THE MOLECULAR WEIGHTS AND TO DETERMINE POSSIBLE PHYSICAL AGGREGATION OF THE FIVE ENZYMES CATALYZING STEPS TWO TO SIX IN THE PRECHORISMIC ACID PORTION OF THE POLYAROMATIC SYNTHETIC PATHWAY IN SIX SPECIES OF BACTERIA: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Aerobacter aerogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptomyces coelicolor. The five enzymes were not aggregated in extracts of any of the species examined, nor are the genes encoding these enzymes clustered in those bacterial species for which genetic evidence exists. (An initial examination of the blue-green alga Anabaena variabilis indicates nonaggregation in this species also.) This situation in bacteria is in marked contrast to that found in Neurospora crassa and other fungi in which the same five enzymes are associated as an aggregate encoded (at least in the case of N. crassa) by a cluster of five genes. In addition, also in contrast to N. crassa, no evidence was obtained for more than one kind of dehydroquinase activity in any of the bacteria examined. These comparative results are discussed in relation to the origin, evolution, and functional significance of the gene-enzyme relationships existing in the early steps of aromatic biosynthesis in bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Regulation of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid in Aerobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Capacity of aspartic acid to increase the bacterial count on suspensions of Escherichia coli after freezing.
AB  - The addition of 2% Trypticase to a minimal salts-glucose plating medium increased the bacterial count of frozen and thawed suspensions of Escherichia coli 451B cells, even when precautions were taken to remove toxic trace elements from the plating diluent. Hydrolysis of the Trypticase with HCl or H(2)SO(4) reduced its count-increasing activity. Treatment of the H(2)SO(4) hydrolysate with a cation-exchange resin greatly improved its capacity to replace Trypticase. Addition of a mixture of amino acids approximating the composition of casein also increased the plate count when added at a level equivalent to 0.1% casein, but at 2% it depressed the count. Tests of amino acids in the mixture revealed that aspartic acid could replace Trypticase completely as a supplement to the basal medium. When added at a level of 2.5 mm, aspartic acid doubled and occasionally tripled the plate count of a suspension of frozen and thawed cells. Glutamic acid, alanine, and to a lesser extent certain other amino acids also showed a capacity to increase the count. Cysteine was without significant effect. Serine and other amino acids depressed the count. None of the amino acids or other supplements affected the count of suspensions of cells that had not been frozen. The effect of adding aspartic acid, cysteine, or Trypticase to the basal medium on the bacterial count of suspensions of various strains of E. coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and two species of Pseudomonas after freezing was examined. The response to the supplements was unique for each organism.
TI  - Polynucleotide sequence relationships among members of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Polynucleotide relationships were examined among many representatives of the Enterobacteriaceae by means of agar, membrane filter, and hydroxyapatite procedures. The amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that reassociated was dependent, especially in interspecific reactions, on the annealing temperature. In only three cases: Escherichia coli-Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium-S. typhi, and Proteus mirabilis-P. vulgaris, was relative interspecific duplex formation 80% or higher. In most cases interspecies DNA duplex formation was 40% or less of that obtained from intraspecies DNA reassociation reactions. The stability of E. coli-S. flexneri DNA duplexes formed at either 60 or 75 C was virtually identical to that of homologous E. coli DNA duplexes, and the degree of interspecies duplex formation was minimally affected by the temperature increase (86% at 60 C; 77% at 75 C). The thermal stability of DNA duplexes formed at 60 C between DNA from E. coli and DNA from strains of Aerobacter aerogenes, S. typhimurium, S. typhi, and P. mirabilis was about 12 to 14 C below that of reassociated E. coli DNA. At 75 C, the formation of the interspecific DNA duplexes was markedly decreased, but the stability of the DNA able to reassociate at this temperature approximated that of reassociated E. coli DNA. The degree of reassociation and the thermal stability of E. coli-S. flexneri DNA duplexes suggests relatively little evolutionary divergence in these organisms. The other enterobacteria tested, however, have diverged to a point where less than one-half of their DNA can reanneal with E. coli DNA at 60 C and less than 10% reacts at 75 C. The degree of divergence between various enterobacteria does not appear to be uniform along the DNA molecule. Ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA)-specific sequences are conserved among most enterobacteria. An examination of messenger RNA relatively specific for the lactose operon suggests that specific chromosomal genes may diverge more or less than the genome as a whole.
TI  - Comparison in normal and leukopenic cows of experimental mastitis due to Aerobacter aerogenes or Escherichia coli endotoxin.
TI  - Immunochemical and enzymatic comparisons of the tryptophan synthase alpha subunits from five species of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The reactive surface structures of alpha subunits of tryptophan synthase from Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Serratia marcescens were compared by measuring (i) their reactivities in micro-complement-fixation assays with antibodies directed specifically to E. coli wild-type alpha subunit, (ii) their reactivities in enzyme neutralization assays with the same antibodies, and (iii) their binding affinities for tryptophan synthase beta(2) subunits. The enzymes from the four heterologous species cross-reacted in the microcomplement-fixation assays with the anti-E. coli alpha subunit antibodies, each to a different degree. However, neutralization titers of the antibodies reacting with the various alpha subunits were comparatively similar, and the beta(2) subunit-binding and -stimulating abilities of the alpha subunits were even more closely alike. The results suggested that the tertiary structure of the beta(2) subunit-binding site of the alpha subunit has been conserved, relative to the rest of the molecule, during the evolutionary divergence of the species of Enterobacteriaceae.

TI  - Pathogenesis of coliform mastitis in cattle. I. Classification of the etiologic agent (Aerobacter aerogenes) and "natural" immune response to its antigens in cattle.
TI  - Induction of adenosine deaminase in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Supplementing the salts-glucose medium of Escherichia coli with adenine initiates induction of adenosine deaminase (adenosine aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.4), growth inhibition, and an increased potential for the net deamination of adenine. The extent and duration of these events are proportional to the initial adenine concentration and are dependent upon adenylate pyrophosphorylase and repression of histidine biosynthesis for maximal expression. The conversion of adenine to hypoxanthine, though limited in rate, occurs concurrently with induction and accounts for the progressively decreasing rate of deaminase induction, since hypoxanthine is a relatively ineffective inducer. The subsequent decrease in deaminase activity is due to dilution by continued cell division and by enzyme inactivation which occurs during the late-log and early-stationary phases. The partially purified deaminase is labile to a number of environmental conditions, particularly to phosphate buffers of pH 6.8 or less. A disproportionately slow rate of adenine deamination by cells utilizing lactate permits a more prolonged period of induction and, consequently, a greater quantity of enzyme to be synthesized; cell division, but not enzyme inactivation, reduces enzyme concentration. The adenosine deaminases of Aerobacter aerogenes and Salmonella typhimurium are not inducible.
TI  - Biosynthesis of diacetyl in bacteria and yeast.
AB  - Both diacetyl and acetoin were produced by cell-free extracts and cultures of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aerobacter aerogenes, Lactobacillus brevis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 299, whereas only acetoin was produced by cell-free extracts and cultures of Streptococcus lactis, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, and S. cerevisiae strains 513 and 522. Cell-free extracts that produced diacetyl did not produce it from acetoin; they produced it from pyruvate, but only if acetyl-coenzyme A was was added to the reaction mixtures. Production of diacetyl by S. cerevisiae 299 was prevented by valine, inhibited by sodium arsenite, and stimulated by pantothenic acid. Valine did not prevent the production of acetoin. E. coli and the three strains of S. cerevisiae did not decarboxylate alpha-acetolactate but did use acetaldehyde in the production of acetoin from pyruvate. The other organisms produced acetoin from pyruvate via alpha-acetolactate.
TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  - A gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic products. The presence of Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli B, Bacillus cereus, and B. popilliae was detected in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7- to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of Serratia marcescens, Aerobacter aerogenes, E. coli K-12, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Metabolites elaborated by the equivalent of less than a single cell of B. cereus, S. faecalis, P. vulgaris, or E. coli B were sensed by the electron capture detector. The flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. Volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.
TI  - Effects in hyperoxia upon microorganisms. I. Membrane culture technique for exposing cells directly to test atmospheres.
AB  - A membrane culture technique was developed for directly exposing microorganisms to test atmospheres. Inhibition and killing were calculated from comparisons with air-grown cultures. Direct colony counts were used with low inocula. With mass inocula, plate colony counts and optical-density measurements were made on resuspended filter populations. Bacteria, including Escherichia coli, were more sensitive to oxygen than previously reported. With inocula of a few hundred cells per membrane, five of seven species failed to produce colonies while exposed to oxygen at one atmosphere. Upon reincubation in air, the survival of five species ranged from near 0 to 12% of the cells. Aerobacter aerogenes was neither inhibited nor killed. With this technique, bacteria are in direct contact with the test atmosphere and cells which survive are detected but do not obscure the response of other cells in the population.
TI  - Evaluation of iron-reducing bacteria in soil and the physiological mechanism of iron-reduction in Aerobacter aerogenes.
TI  - Ribosyl and deoxyribosyl transfer by bacterial enzyme systems.
AB  - The enzymatic transfer of ribose and deoxyribose residues in pyrimidine nucleosides to purines was catalyzed by cell-free extracts of various bacteria. Almost all the strains belonging to Enterobacteriaceae were capable of catalyzing the transfer reactions. The transfer activities were also detected among some bacterial strains of other families: Pseudomonadaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, Micrococcaceae, Bacteriaceae, and Bacillaceae. The rates of the transfer reactions were greatly enhanced in the presence of phosphate ion, and the participation of nucleoside phosphorylases in the reactions was suggested. Uridine phosphorylase, thymidine phosphorylase, and purine nucleoside phosphorylase were purified from cell-free extract of Aerobacter aerogenes IFO 3321. The ribosyl transfer from uridine to hypoxanthine was found to be catalyzed by the coupled reactions of uridine and purine nucleoside phosphorylases and the deoxyribosyl transfer from thymidine to hypoxanthine by the coupled reactions of thymidine and purine nucleoside phosphorylases.
TI  - The biosynthesis of tyrosine in Aerobacter aerogenes: partial purification of the T protein.
TI  - A pH 7 buffer devoid of nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus for use in bacteriological systems.
AB  - Apparent pK values were determined for a series of commercially available carboxylic acids in a search for a buffer suitable for bacterial studies at pH 7 in media free from nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. Of the compounds possessing pK' values near pH 7,3,6-endomethylene-1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalic acid (EMTA) was chosen as possessing suitable physical properties, cost, and purity for biological use. Aerobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli grew normally in its presence but did not utilize it as a sole source and energy. Although good turbidimetric data could not be obtained, Pseudomonas aeruginosa responded in the same qualitative way. Therefore, EMTA promises to be useful in work on endogenous metabolism and in nutritional studies.
TI  - Cystathionine as a precursor of methionine in Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes.
AB  - Balish, Edward (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Ill.), and Stanley K. Shapiro. Cystathionine as a precursor of methionine in Escherichai coli and Aerobacter aerogenes. J. Bacteriol. 92:1331-1336. 1966.-Cystathionine has been shown to be a precursor of methionine biosynthesis in Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes. A double enzyme assay was developed to show the formation of homocysteine from cystathionine. The results obtained support the concept that cystathionine serves as a precursor of methionine via the intermediate formation of homocysteine. The latter compound is methylated by the homocysteine methyltransferase of these microorganisms. Sulfhydryl and keto acid assays were used to demonstrate cystathionase activity. Methionine represses both homocysteine methyltransferase formation and cystathionase formation. However, the presence of methionine in reaction mixtures resulted in product inhibition of homocysteine methyltransferase activity, but not of cystathionase activity.
TI  - Bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci and other microorganisms.
AB  - Yotis, William (Loyola University, Hines, Ill.), and Ronald Stanke. Bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci and other microorganisms. J. Bacteriol. 92:1285-1289. 1966.-Progesterone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric and manometric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of progesterone. The organisms tested consisted of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Gaffkya tetragena, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella paratyphi, and Proteus vulgaris. Antibacterial action was shown by progesterone only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 20 mug of progesterone per ml. Pregnenolone, 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one, and 5alpha-pregnane also possessed antistaphylococcal properties, whereas pregnanolone, pregnandione, 11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone did not. The bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation, and it was reduced in the presence of oxygen. In the presence of 20 mug of progesterone per ml, there was significant reduction in the oxidation by resting staphylococcal suspensions or utilization by staphylococci of pyruvate as an energy source during growth.
TI  - Detection and identification of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  - Ether extracts of cultures of 29 strains representing 6 species of Bacillus, and  of individual strains of Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined in a gas chromatograph by use of flame ionization and electron capture detectors. Among the products detected were compounds with the chromatographic characteristics of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, ethyl alcohol, diacetyl, acetoin, and 2,3-butanediol. The differences in peak areas of the various products formed by the bacteria were determined statistically for the chromatograms obtained with the two detectors, and the peaks were arranged in order of decreasing areas to yield a signature for each bacterial strain. Different signatures were obtained for the various genera and species and for strains of the same species. B. licheniformis, B. subtilis, and A. aerogenes formed significant quantities of a number of volatile compounds, and qualitative and quantitative differences between strains were noted. The electron capture detector was particularly sensitive to diacetyl and acetoin as well as to unknown compounds. By use of this detector, the presence of 5 pg of diacetyl and 20 pg of acetoin could be demonstrated. The quantity of acetoin detected in B. subtilis and B. licheniformis cultures was present in as little as 6.3 x 10(-3) muliters of medium.
TI  - Differentiation of Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes by gas liquid chromatography.
TI  - Comparison of the tryptophan synthetase alpha-subunits of several species of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Creighton, T. E. (Stanford University, Stanford), D. R. Helinski, R. L. Somerville, and C. Yanofsky. Comparison of the tryptophan synthetase alpha subunits of several species of Enterobacteriaceae. J. Bacteriol. 91:1819-1826. 1966.-The tryptophan synthetase alpha subunits of Escherichia coli K-12, E. coli B, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Aerobacter aerogenes have been purified and their structures compared. Each of these alpha subunits exhibits a sedimentation coefficient of about 2.7S. Peptide patterns of trypsin plus chymotrypsin digests of the alpha subunits have indicated that all of the alpha subunits have peptide regions in common. The patterns of E. coli K-12, E. coli B, and S. dysenteriae alpha subunits appear to be nearly identical, whereas the alpha subunits from S. typhimurium and A. aerogenes differ from those of E. coli and from each other. It has also been shown that the E. coli structural gene for the alpha subunit is translated identically in E. coli and S. typhimurium.

TI  - Metabolic injury to bacteria. I. Effect of freezing and storage on the requirements of Aerobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli for growth.
TI  - Effect of coliform and Proteus bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cultures of coliform and Proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of Staphylococcus aureus in Trypticase Soy Broth. Inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 C). Time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. When the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 C (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of Proteus. When the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 C, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 C, and only Escherichia coli delayed the coccus at 30 C. All effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 C when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. Greatest overall inhibition was by E. coli, E. freundii, and Proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 C. Aerobacter cloacae and Paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 C. In general, results were similar with different strains of a species. Except for Aerobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., and P. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.
TI  - The purification and properties of a penicillinase whose synthesis is mediated by an R-factor in Escherichia coli.
AB  - 1. The penicillinase (beta-lactamase) from Escherichia coli strain TEM has been purified and its activity against a range of penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives measured. 2. The enzyme shows little resemblance to penicillinases from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 16700+/-5%, which is about half the value obtained for other penicillinases. 4. The enzyme is most similar in properties to a crude preparation of a penicillinase from Klebsiella (Aerobacter) aerogenes, but clearly different from crude enzyme preparations from other strains of E. coli. 5. Since penicillinase synthesis in E. coli strain TEM is mediated by an R-factor known to infect many other species of Enterobacteriaceae, the appearance of similar enzymes in other Gramnegative species is not surprising.
TI  - The inhibition of ribosomal ribonuclease by bacterial ribosomes.
AB  - 1. A comparison has been made between the ribonuclease activities of untreated ribosomes from Escherichia coli B and Pseudomonas fluorescens and the activities of ribosomes on to which ribosomal ribonuclease from E. coli B has been adsorbed. 2. The normal ribosomes from both species were stable in 5-10mm-Mg(2+) (I0.16) at pH6. The RNA in ribosomes from Ps. fluorescens was attacked by the adsorbed ribonuclease under these conditions, whereas the ribosomes from E. coli B were able to adsorb and inhibit this enzyme. 3. Inhibition was also observed with ribosomes from Aerobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris and two other strains of E. coli. It was not observed in ribosomes from three species of Pseudomonas. 4. The inhibition depended on the integrity of the ribosomes and was not observed under conditions of low Mg(2+) concentration that cause irreversible degradation into more slowly sedimenting particles.
TI  - The bacterial induction of homograft sensitivity. II. Effects of sensitization with staphylococci and other microoorganisms.
AB  - Heat-killed strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus albus can induce  in guinea pigs a state of altered reactivity to skin homografts which is indistinguishable from that which results from sensitization with homologous tissues or Group A streptococci. Challenge of suitably prepared recipients with first-set skin homografts obtained from unrelated randomly selected donors elicits white graft reactions or accelerated rejection of such grafts. Other bacteria tested included Lancefield streptococcal groups B, C, D, E, G, H, L, and O, pneumococcus Types II, III, XIV and a rough strain, Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, Neisseria catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and two human virulent strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. None of these microorganisms was active in the induction of homograft sensitivity in the guinea pig. Pretreatment of recipients with Gram-negative bacterial suspensions was associated with a slight increase in the mean survival time of first-set skin homografts. Results of this study suggest the presence in staphylococci, as well as in Group A streptococci, of antigens related in their biologic effects to tissue transplantation antigens.

TI  - EFFECT OF NATURALLY OCCURRING XANTHINES ON BACTERIA. I. ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION AND  POTENTIATING EFFECT ON ANTIBIOTIC SPECTRA.
AB  - The effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. The antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. Caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. Caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. The effect was both bacteriostatic and bactericidal against susceptible organisms. The susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. The morphology of Aerobacter aerogenes and A. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. Potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. This potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.
TI  - EFFECT OF PHENOLIC ACIDS AND ESTERS ON RESPIRATION AND REPRODUCTION OF BACTERIA IN URINE.
AB  - Vanillic, syringic, gallic, and protocatechuic acids, methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate generally inhibited respiration in vitro of Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aerobacter aerogenes in human urine. In the absence of any other available carbon source, certain of the phenolic compounds were utilized. Reproduction was generally suppressed in urine buffered to pH 7, 5.6, 4.5, and 4.0. The phenolic compounds were used in the range of 0.11 to 0.99 mumole/ml.

AB  - A comparative estimation of the coliform population of raw sewage, activated sludge, and the effluent derived therefrom revealed that raw sewage had a preponderance of Escherichia coli (75%), as compared with 25 and 30%, respectively, in sludge and effluent. Nitrogen-free mannitol-sucrose enrichments of activated sludge resulted in the isolation of Azotobacter agilis, Aerobacter aerogenes, Corynebacterium laevaniformans, and an Achromabacter species. Sludge had a large population of C. laevaniformans and A. aerogenes but not of Azotobacter. The bacterial parasites, Bdellovibrio and bacteriophages, were not active during activated-sludge treatment. A 10-fold reduction in phage content occurred after 2 hr of aeration, but the Bdellovibrio population was unaffected.

AB  - A study of the inhibitory effect of 24 different combinations of brilliant green  and bile salts concentrations was conducted, using seven species of microorganisms capable of fermenting mannitol. The inhibitory effect of brilliant green decreased as the bile salts concentration was increased. Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus rettgeri were inhibited by all test media. Escherichia coli was inhibited in all but two combinations of brilliant green and bile salts. Aerobacter aerogenes generally followed a pattern of growth similar to that of three species of salmonellae. Three of the 24 combinations of brilliant green and bile salts showed little or no inhibition of salmonellae but did inhibit the other organisms studied.

Bacteriol. 88:1790-1797. 1964.-Exposure of gram-negative bacteria to cephalothin (7-[thiophene-2-acetamido]-cephalosporanic acid) revealed the formation of long filaments and large bodies, which were capable of reverting to normal cells when removed from contact with the drug. The degree of morphological change was found to be related to the concentration of antibiotic in which the organisms were suspended. The large bodies were altered by contact with solutions of varying osmolarity. Different species showed variation in the ability to develop large bodies. A relationship between antibiotic sensitivity and the capacity to resist morphological alteration was observed. Though most sensitive gram-negative bacilli were strikingly changed by exposure to cephalothin, naturally resistant ones were unaffected. Organisms made drug-resistant in vitro underwent changes in cellular form which were qualitatively the same but less intense than those which developed in parent strains originally sensitive to cephalothin.

Sporadic results usually obtained with quaternaries tested by the procedure of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists (AOAC) were eliminated by the methods of this study. The use-dilution procedure employs the material upon which the disinfectant is to be used, rather than stainless steel, as in the AOAC use-dilution test. The importance of testing each disinfectant against several organisms and in the presence of organic material is discussed.

Further comparative tests were also carried out with ampicillin, chloramphenicol, colistin sulphate, colistin methane sulphonate, cycloserine, kanamycin, nitrofurantoin, polymyxin, streptomycin, and tetracycline, using groups of 20 strains of each of the main species selected at random from the total number of isolates. Of the total number of isolates a higher percentage was inhibited by ampicillin than by tetracycline or chloramphenicol. Ampicillin showed particularly high activity against certain species of bacteria and displayed an antibacterial spectrum not shown by any of the other antibiotics tested.

Cell-free enzymes concerned in respiration and prepared from the same organisms are not inhibited by these salts, whereas these same enzymes tested in intact cells are. The physical state of the cell membrane appears to be a factor controlling its respiratory activity.

AB  - The effect of aqueous extracts of carob (Ceratonia siliqua) pods, gallotannic acid, gallic acid, and catechol on several microorganisms was studied. Carob pod extract and tannic acid showed a strong antimicrobial activity toward some cellulolytic bacteria. On the basis of tannin content, to which antimicrobial effect was related, carob pod extracts inhibited Cellvibrio fulvus and Clostridium cellulosolvens at 15 mug/ml, Sporocytophaga myxococcoides at 45 mug/ml, and Bacillus subtilis at 75 mug/ml. The inhibiting concentrations for tannic acid were found to be 12, 10, 45, and 30 mug/ml, respectively. Gallic acid and catechol were much less effective. Tannic acid and the tannin fraction of carob extract exerted both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on C. fulvus. Respiration of C. fulvus in the presence of bactericidal concentrations of tannic acid or tannin fraction of carob extract was inhibited less than 30%. A partial formation of "protoplasts" by C. fulvus was obtained after 2 hr of incubation in a growth medium to which 20% sucrose, 0.15% MgSO(4).7H(2)O, and 10 to 50 mug/ml of tannic acid or 500mug/ml of penicillin, or both, had been added. Tannic acid and the tannin fraction of carob extract protected C. fulvus from metabolic lysis in sucrose solution. Although the growth of other microorganisms tested was only slightly affected, the morphology of some of them was drastically changed in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of carob pod extracts of tannic acid. It is suggested that the site of action of tannins on sensitive microorganisms is primarily the cell envelope.

AB  - A study of the coliforms found on sugarcane plants throughout the growing season  indicated that members of the genus Aerobacter comprise a part of the epiphytic microflora. When quantitative determinations were made of the coliforms by means of the most probable number technique, no completed tests were obtained on young sugarcane plants during the test period of February through May; however, Paracolobactrum aerogenoides was isolated frequently. Nine different IMViC types of coliforms were identified among the 198 isolates chosen for study. The predominating coliform found at the top, middle, and bottom portions of the sugarcane plants was A. cloacae, but the type predominating in leaf-sheath water was A. aerogenes. Only once was Escherichia coli found associated with the plants at the high dilutions necessary for determining most probable numbers. The numbers of different coliforms occurring in sugarcane juice were generally divided equally among A. aerogenes, A. cloacae, and E. coli. More variety among the IMViC types seemed to occur on the cane plants than in the leaf-sheath water or the cane juice in the mill.

Bacteriol. 87:337-340. 1964.-Cultures of Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Paracolobactrum species, isolated from human feces and from intestinal contents of rats, were tested for riboflavine synthesis in a chemically defined medium. Riboflavine was assayed by a fluorometric method and by microbiological assay. When uric acid was added to the synthetic medium at levels ranging from 10 to 750 mug/ml, it inhibited the production of riboflavine, but did not affect the growth of the bacteria. As the amount of uric acid in the medium was increased from 10 to 750 mug, there was a corresponding decrease in the amount of riboflavine produced. Some disappearance of uric acid was observed in the cultures. These results suggest that uric acid, or its degradation products, may have acted as an antimetabolite or an enzyme inactivator in the biosynthesis of riboflavine.

Bacteriol. 86:992-998. 1963.-Hydrogenase and its synthesis were more heat-sensitive in psychrophilic strain 82 than in mesophilic Escherichia coli. The enzyme was not formed above 20 C by the psychrophile, whereas it was formed by E. coli and other mesophiles at 45 C. Aerobically grown cells of strain 82 do not contain hydrogenase but could be induced to form the enzyme by incubation with glucose and amino acids. Hydrogenase adaptation proceeded best at pH 8.0. The psychrophile hydrogenase was destroyed 50% by exposure to 60 C for 2 hr compared with 25% destruction of mesophile hydrogenase under the same conditions. The psychrophile hydrogenase was most active at pH 9.0, and the mesophile hydrogenase was most active at pH 10.0 or higher.
TI  - FOOD MICROORGANISMS INFLUENCING THE GROWTH OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS.
AB  - Some 870 cultures of predominating micro-organisms were isolated from market samples of hamburger, fresh pork sausage, fresh fish fillets, stewing beef, frozen chicken pot pie, frozen corn, frozen peas, and pasteurized and raw milk, before and after storage at different temperatures. The isolates were screened for their ability to influence the growth of Staphylococcus aureus strain 196E by means of spot-plate tests on APT and nutrient agars at 25 C. The 438 cultures that influenced the growth of S. aureus were retested on spot plates at 15, 30, and 42 C. After elimination of replicates, the 143 remaining cultures were classified into species, genera, or groups, and 14 different cultures were tested for their influence on the growth of S. aureus in APT broth at 25 C. Over half of the effective cultures inhibited S. aureus and less than half were stimulatory. Pork sausage had the highest proportion of inhibitory cultures, and stewing beef had the lowest. APT agar was better than nutrient agar for screening, and incubation at 15 C gave more effector organisms than at 30 and 42 C. Most of the lactic acid bacteria were inhibitory, but other groups of bacteria contained more stimulatory cultures than inhibitory ones. The three Escherichia coli cultures were stimulatory, but most other Escherichia cultures were inhibitory. Aerobacter and Paracolobactrum isolates were mostly stimulatory. Cultures of other kinds of bacteria were more or less evenly distributed between inhibitory ones and stimulatory ones. Genera containing mostly inhibitory bacteria were Streptococcus, Leuconostoc, and Lactobacillus. Inhibitory species were E. freundii and E. intermedia. Tests with S. aureus in broth indicated that all cultures inhibitory according to spot plates were inhibitory in broth, but stimulation on spot plates did not always indicate the same phenomenon in broth.

Bacteriol. 85:1061-1070. 1963.-The stability of strains of various species of gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria was investigated by subculturing each strain through ten different media, testing the substrains so produced through a standard series of tests, and analyzing the resulting data by electronic computer. Strain stability was shown to be high [similarity coefficient (S) >/= 80%], and some evidence was obtained for species stability (S >/= 75%). The limits of variability for a species were studied by use of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 33 P. aeruginosa strains (from the American Type Culture Collection) were tested and found to share a high level of similarity. An analysis was made of the distribution of positive characters among the strains, and the group was found to have a mean total of 35 characters (out of a possible 78 which were coded and included in the computer analyses) with a range of 33 to 39 positive characters in individual organisms. The frequency of occurrence of each positive character and the probability of mutual occurrence of pairs of positive characters were calculated. By use of the quantitative and qualitative data so obtained, a hypothetical Median Organism for the P. aeruginosa group was derived. The species may then be defined as consisting of all strains which show an S relationship of 75% or more with the Median Organism. The general applicability of this concept is discussed.
TI  - IN VITRO BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF CEPHALOTHIN.
AB  - Chang, Te-Wen (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Mass.) and Louis Weinstein. In vitro biological activity of cephalothin. J. Bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-Cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Shigella, Salmonella, and Proteus mirabilis were the most sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Herellea were highly resistant. Penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of S. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. Exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with S. aureus. Cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. Cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. This antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin G but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.

Five others, Bacillus cereus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli H-52, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were Seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 C for 10 min. Inhibition was not caused by changes in pH, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. The concentrated antibiotic material from E. coli H-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.

AB  - The effects of environmental factors on the inhibition of an enterotoxin-producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria were investigated. Type of medium and temperature of incubation were important factors in determining the amount of inhibition. The pH range of maximal inhibition was found to be 7.4 to 6.2. Availability of oxygen was not a factor. As the ratios of inhibitor to staphylococcus were increased from 1:1 to 10:1 and 100:1, the amount of inhibition was markedly increased. Inhibition occurred in custard, where it increased with increasing ratios of effector to staphylococcus. The repression of the staphylococcus in all media usually was sufficient to be of practical significance.

TI  - Effect of bromidehypochlorite bactericides on microorganisms.
AB  - A new principle in compounding stable, granular bactericidal products led to unique combinations of a water-soluble inorganic bromide salt with a hypochlorite-type disinfectant of either inorganic or organic type. Microbiological results are shown for an inorganic bactericide composed of chlorinated trisodium phosphate containing 3.1% "available chlorine" and 2% potassium bromide, and for an organic bactericide formulated from sodium dichloroisocyanurate so as to contain 13.4% "available chlorine" and 8% potassium bromide. Comparison of these products with their nonbromide counterparts are reported for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus lactis, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Proteus vulgaris. Test methods employed were the Chambers test, the A.O.A.C. Germicidal and Detergent Sanitizer-Official test, and the Available Chlorine Germicidal Equivalent Concentration test. The minimal killing concentrations for the bromide-hypochlorite bactericides against this variety of organisms were reduced by a factor 2 to 24 times those required for similar hypochlorite-type disinfectants not containing the bromide.

Bacteriol. 82:305-312. 1961.-Under anaerobic conditions Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes, inoculated in a mineral-citrate-glucose medium at densities up to 10(6) bacteria per ml, exhibit a long lag, or fail to initiate growth at all. Growth is initiated rapidly if the medium is supplemented with various SH or SS compounds. Of these the most active is l-cystine, which is fully effective at 1 to 2 mum. In a heavily seeded semisolid medium without cystine, turbidity rapidly appears at the aerobic surface and then slowly extends throughout the anaerobic region of the culture. This finding implies that a sufficiently dense anaerobically growing culture creates conditions in the medium which eliminate the requirement for cystine. The nature of this effect on the medium has not been determined, but certain possibilities (pH, pCO(2)) have been eliminated. The anaerobic cystine requirement becomes more pronounced in the presence of Cu(++), at concentrations far lower than those required for inhibition under aerobic conditions. While it is possible that cystine is acting by complexing the toxic metal ion, it seems more likely that l-cystine is an essential metabolite, poorly produced under anaerobic conditions, and that the marked toxicity of Cu(++) under anaerobic conditions depends on its complexing of cystine.
