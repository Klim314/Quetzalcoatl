TI  == group a streptococcus inhibitors by high-throughput virtual screening.
AB  == group a streptococcus (gas) is a gram-positive bacterium, which can cause multiple types of disease from mild infections of skin and throat to invasive and life-threatening infections. recently rnase j1 and j2 were found to be essential  for the growth of gas. in order to identify inhibitors against rnase j1/j2, homology models of both the ligand-free apo-form and the ligand-bound holo-form complexes were constructed as templates for high-throughput virtual screening (htvs). a focused small molecule library and the commercially available maybridge database were employed as sources for potential inhibitors. a cell-based biological assay identified two compounds with 10 mum mic activity.

TI  == efficient genome engineering in human pluripotent stem cells using cas9 from neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == genome engineering in human pluripotent stem cells (hpscs) holds great promise for biomedical research and regenerative medicine. recently, an rna-guided, dna-cleaving interference pathway from bacteria [the type ii clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (crispr)-crispr-associated (cas) pathway]  has been adapted for use in eukaryotic cells, greatly facilitating genome editing. only two crispr-cas systems (from streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus thermophilus), each with their own distinct targeting requirements  and limitations, have been developed for genome editing thus far. furthermore, limited information exists about homology-directed repair (hdr)-mediated gene targeting using long donor dna templates in hpscs with these systems. here, using a distinct crispr-cas system from neisseria meningitidis, we demonstrate efficient targeting of an endogenous gene in three hpsc lines using hdr. the cas9 rna-guided endonuclease from n. meningitidis (nmcas9) recognizes a 5'-nnnngatt-3' protospacer adjacent motif (pam) different from those recognized by cas9 proteins from s. pyogenes and s. thermophilus (spcas9 and stcas9, respectively). similar to spcas9, nmcas9 is able to use a single-guide rna (sgrna) to direct its activity. because of its distinct protospacer adjacent motif, the n. meningitidis crispr-cas machinery increases the sequence contexts amenable to rna-directed genome editing.

TI  == crrna and tracrrna guide cas9-mediated dna interference in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the cas9-crrna complex of the streptococcus thermophilus dgcc7710 crispr3-cas system functions as an rna-guided endonuclease with crrna-directed target sequence recognition and protein-mediated dna cleavage. we show here that an additional rna molecule, tracrrna (trans-activating crispr rna), co-purifies with the cas9 protein isolated from the heterologous e. coli strain carrying the s. thermophilus dgcc7710 crispr3-cas system. we provide experimental evidence that tracrrna is required for cas9-mediated dna interference both in vitro and in vivo. we show that cas9 specifically promotes duplex formation between the precursor crrna (pre-crrna) transcript and tracrrna, in vitro. furthermore, the housekeeping rnase iii contributes to primary pre-crrna-tracrrna duplex cleavage  for mature crrna biogenesis. rnase iii, however, is not required in the processing of a short pre-crrna transcribed from a minimal crispr array containing a single spacer. finally, we show that an in vitro-assembled ternary cas9-crrna-tracrrna complex cleaves dna. this study further specifies the molecular basis for crrna-based re-programming of cas9 to specifically cleave any target dna sequence for precise genome surgery. the processes for crrna maturation and effector complex assembly established here will contribute to the  further development of the cas9 re-programmable system for genome editing applications.

TI  == in silico modeling of the type 2 idi enzymes of bacillus licheniformis, pseudomonas stutzeri, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus for virtual screening of potential inhibitors of this therapeutic target.
AB  == isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase is an essential enzyme in those living organisms such as pathogenic strains of streptococcus and staphylococcus genera which rely on the mevalonate pathway for the production of isoprenoids. the pathogens contain type 2 idi in contrast to human that contains type 1 idi. therefore, the type 2 idi may be a potential target for the therapy of some infectious diseases. in the current study, a virtual screening by docking was performed among 2000 chemicals from cococo library to find a specific inhibitor for type 2 idis. to this end, the structures of the type 2 idis of bacillus licheniformis, pseudomonas stutzeri, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were molded using comparative modeling and hidden markov model (hmm) based prediction. the predicted models were evaluated based on q-mean and prosa score.  molegro virtual docker with moldock scoring function was used for measuring the binding affinity of the found inhibitor to the active site of the models. also the inhibition effect of the compound was virtually tested on the crystallography-solved structures of the sulfolobus shibatae and thermus thermophilus type 2 idis as well as the escherichia coli type 1 idi. finally, the inhibition effect of the found inhibitor was virtually tested on the human type 1 idi. interestingly, the results suggest that the inhibitor efficiently binds to and inhibits the bacterial idis especially the type 2 idis of pathogens while it  is not inhibiting the human idi.

TI  == protein domain repetition is enriched in streptococcal cell-surface proteins.
AB  == tandem repetition of domain in protein sequence occurs in all three domains of life. it creates protein diversity and adds functional complexity in organisms. in this work, we analyzed 52 streptococcal genomes and found 3748 proteins contained domain repeats. proteins not harboring domain repeats are significantly enriched in cytoplasm, whereas proteins with domain repeats are significantly enriched in cytoplasmic membrane, cell wall and extracellular locations. domain repetition occurs most frequently in s. pneumoniae and least in s. thermophilus and s. pyogenes. duf1542 is the highest repeated domain in a single protein, followed by rib, cw_binding_1, g5 and hemolysincabind. 3d structures of 24 repeat-containing proteins were predicted to investigate the structural and functional effect of domain repetition. several repeat-containing streptococcal cell surface proteins are known to be virulence-associated. surface-associated tandem domain-containing proteins without experimental functional characterization may be potentially involved in the pathogenesis of streptococci  and deserve further investigation.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == lateral gene transfer of streptococcal ice element rd2 (region of difference 2) encoding secreted proteins.
AB  == background: the genome of serotype m28 group a streptococcus (gas) strain mgas6180 contains a novel genetic element named region of difference 2 (rd2) that encodes seven putative secreted extracellular proteins. rd2 is present in all serotype m28 strains and strains of several other gas serotypes associated with female urogenital infections. we show here that the gas rd2 element is present in strain mgas6180 both as an integrative chromosomal form and a circular extrachromosomal element. rd2-like regions were identified in publicly available  genome sequences of strains representing three of the five major group b streptococcal serotypes causing human disease. ten rd2-encoded proteins have significant similarity to proteins involved in conjugative transfer of streptococcus thermophilus integrative chromosomal elements (ices). results: we transferred rd2 from gas strain mgas6180 (serotype m28) to serotype m1 and m4 gas strains by filter mating. the copy number of the rd2 element was rapidly and significantly increased following treatment of strain mgas6180 with mitomycin c,  a dna damaging agent. using a pcr-based method, we also identified rd2-like regions in multiple group c and g strains of streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp.equisimilis cultured from invasive human infections. conclusions: taken together, the data indicate that the rd2 element has disseminated by lateral gene transfer to genetically diverse strains of human-pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == conjugative transfer of the integrative conjugative elements icest1 and icest3 from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == integrative and conjugative elements (ices), also called conjugative transposons, are genomic islands that excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate in the genome of the recipient bacterium. the current investigation shows the intraspecies conjugative transfer of the first described ices in streptococcus thermophilus, icest1 and icest3. mitomycin c, a dna-damaging agent, derepresses icest3 conjugative transfer almost 25-fold. the icest3 host range was determined  using various members of the firmicutes as recipients. whereas numerous icest3 transconjugants of streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis were recovered, only one transconjugant of lactococcus lactis was obtained. the newly  incoming ices, except the one from l. lactis, are site-specifically integrated into the 3' end of the fda gene and are still able to excise in these transconjugants. furthermore, icest3 was retransferred from e. faecalis to s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmids carrying different parts of the icest1 recombination module were used to show that the integrase gene is required for the site-specific integration and excision of the ices, whereas the excisionase gene is required for the site-specific excision only.

TI  == identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating sos mutagenesis in streptococcus uberis.
AB  == streptococci have been considered to lack the classical sos response, defined by  increased mutation after uv exposure and regulation by lexa. here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated sos mutagenesis gene cassette in the streptococcaceae family. exposure to uv light was found to increase mutations to  antibiotic resistance in streptococcus uberis cultures. the mutational spectra revealed mainly g:c-->a:t transitions, and northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a y-family dna polymerase resembling umuc under dna-damaging conditions. in the absence of the y-family polymerase, s. uberis cells were sensitive to uv light and to mitomycin c. furthermore, the uv-induced  mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the y-family polymerase. the gene encoding the y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a hdir homolog. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that s. uberis hdir binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus thermophilus strains. in addition, the umuc operon was localized in several mobile dna elements of streptococcus and lactococcus species. we conclude that the hdir-umuc-orf3-orf4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating sos mutagenesis among members of the streptococcaceae.

TI  == gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  == bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (lgt) is  a predominant force in bacterial evolution. to better understand the significance of lgt, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal  genomes using a maximum likelihood method. this study indicates that the rate of  gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each  species. we have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by lgt and conclude that at least  a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.

TI  == comparative genomics reveals close genetic relationships between phages from dairy bacteria and pathogenic streptococci: evolutionary implications for prophage-host interactions.
AB  == the genome of the highly pathogenic m1 serotype streptococcus pyogenes isolate sf370 contains eight prophage elements. only prophage sf370.1 could be induced by mitomycin c treatment. prophage sf370.3 showed a 33.5-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of the cos-site temperate siphovirus r1t infecting the dairy bacterium lactococcus lactis. the two-phage genomes shared between 60 and 70% nucleotide sequence identity over the dna packaging, head and  tail genes. analysis of the sf370.3 genome revealed mutations in the replisome organizer gene that may prevent the induction of the prophage. the mutated phage  replication gene was closely related to a virulence marker identified in recently emerged m3 serotype s. pyogenes strains in japan. this observation suggests that  prophage genes confer selective advantage to the lysogenic host. sf370.3 encodes  a hyaluronidase and a dnase that may facilitate the spreading of s. pyogenes through tissue planes of its human host. prophage sf370.2 showed a 43-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of pac-site temperate siphoviridae infecting the dairy bacteria s. thermophilus and l. lactis. over part of the structural genes, the similarity between sf370.2 and s. thermophilus  phage o1205 extended to the nucleotide sequence level. sf370.2 showed two probable inactivating mutations: one in the replisome organizer gene and another  in the gene encoding the portal protein. prophage sf370.2 also encodes a hyaluronidase and in addition two very likely virulence factors: prophage-encoded toxins acting as superantigens that may contribute to the immune deregulation observed during invasive streptococcal infections. the superantigens are encoded  between the phage lysin and the right attachment site of the prophage genome. the genes were nearly sequence identical with a dna segment in s. equi, suggesting horizontal gene transfer. the trend for prophage genome inactivation was even more evident for the remaining five prophage sequences that showed massive losses of prophage dna. in these prophage remnants only 13-0.3 kb of putative prophage dna was detected. we discuss the genomics data from s. pyogenes strain sf370 within the framework of darwinian coevolution of prophages and lysogenic bacteria and suggest elements of genetic cooperation and elements of an arms race in this  host-parasite relationship.

TI  == cold shock proteins and low-temperature response of streptococcus thermophilus cnrz302.
AB  == low-temperature adaptation and cryoprotection were studied in the thermophilic lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus cnrz302. s. thermophilus actively adapts to freezing during a pretreatment at 20 degrees c, resulting in an approximately 1, 000-fold increased survival after four freeze-thaw cycles compared to mid-exponential-phase cells grown at an optimal temperature of 42 degrees c. no adaptation is observed when cells are exposed to a temperature (10  degrees c) below the minimal growth temperature of the strain (just below 15 degrees c). by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis several 7-kda cold-induced proteins were identified, which are the major induced proteins after a shift to 20 degrees c. these cold shock proteins were maximally expressed at 20 degrees c, while the induction level was low after cold shock to 10 degrees c. to confirm the presence of csp genes in s. thermophilus, a pcr strategy was used which yielded products of different sizes. sequence analysis revealed csp-like sequences that were up to 95% identical to those of csp genes of s. thermophilus  st1-1, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactococcus lactis. northern blot analysis revealed a seven- to ninefold induction of csp mrna after a temperature shift to 20 degrees c, showing that this thermophilic bacterium indeed contains at least one cold-inducible csp gene and that its regulation takes place at the transcriptional level.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == production of cholera toxin b subunit in lactobacillus.
AB  == the intracellular expression of the b subunit of cholera toxin (ctb) was first achieved in lactobacillus paracasei lbtgs1.4 with an expression cassette including the p25 promoter of streptococcus thermophilus combined with the translation initiation region from the strongly expressed l. pentosus d-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhd). secretion of ctb was next attempted in l. paracasei lbtgs1.4 and l. plantarum ncimb8826 with four different signal sequences from exported proteins of lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis usp45 and prtp, enterococcus faecalis unknown protein and s. pyogenes m6 protein). host-dependent secretion of ctb was clearly observed: whereas none of the secretion cassettes led to detectable ctb in the extracellular fraction of l. paracasei lbtgs1.4, secretion of ctb molecules was clearly achieved with three of the selected signal sequences in l. plantarum ncimb8826.

TI  == characterization of a novel insertion sequence, is1194, in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == a novel insertion sequence, is1194, has been identified in the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368. this 1200-bp element has 16-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the single large open reading frame of this  element encodes a 332-amino-acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is5 group  of the is4 family. a single copy of is1194 was detected by hybridization in only  2 of the 19 s. thermophilus strains tested and in 4 of the 13 lactococcus lactis  strains investigated. this suggests that this is element was acquired by horizontal transfer. the unique is1194 copy of s. thermophilus cnrz368 is located in a region of at least 12 kb that was probably acquired by horizontal transfer from l. lactis. furthermore, the is1194 right end is identical to sequences found in a broad-host-range conjugative plasmid from streptococcus pyogenes, psm19035.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == cell wall anchoring of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

TI  == arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  == bacterial cell walls from str. bovis, str. lactis, str. mutans, str. thermophilus, str. salivarius, and str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. s. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. it was also shown that cell  walls from s. epidermidis, b. megaterium, and m. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. a close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the ppd hypersensitivity. it was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
