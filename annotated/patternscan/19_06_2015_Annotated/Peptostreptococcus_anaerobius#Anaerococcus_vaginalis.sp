TI  == development of 16s rrna-based probes for the identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  == fluorescent probes targeted at 16s rrna were designed for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus stomatis (pana134), parvimonas micra (pamic1435), finegoldia magna (fmag1250), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (pnasa1254), peptoniphilus ivorii (pnivo731), peptoniphilus harei (pnhar1466), anaerococcus vaginalis (avag1280) and anaerococcus lactolyticus (alac1438), based on the 16s rrna sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. these strains were also used for validation of the probes. application  of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) could be identified with this set of probes. the 16s rrnas of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. most of these isolates were gpac that were not targeted by the probes. no clinical isolates of pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. the fmag1250, pamic1435, pnhar1466, pana134, pnasa1254 and pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. the avag1280 and alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. however, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for  the majority of clinical isolates.

TI  == rapid identification of gram-positive anaerobic coccal species originally classified in the genus peptostreptococcus by multiplex pcr assays using genus- and species-specific primers.
AB  == here, a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex pcr assay for identifying 14 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) species originally classified in the genus peptostreptococcus (anaerococcus hydrogenalis, anaerococcus lactolyticus, anaerococcus octavius, anaerococcus prevotii, anaerococcus tetradius, anaerococcus vaginalis, finegoldia magna, micromonas micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, peptoniphilus harei, peptoniphilus indolicus, peptoniphilus ivorii and peptoniphilus lacrimalis) is reported. fourteen type strains representing 14 gpac species were first identified to the genus level by multiplex pcr (multiplex pcr-g). since three of these genera (finegoldia, micromonas and peptostreptococcus) contain only a single species, f. magna, m. micros and p. anaerobius, respectively, these organisms were identified to the species level directly by using the multiplex pcr-g. then six species of the genus anaerococcus (a. hydrogenalis, a. lactolyticus, a. octavius, a. prevotii, a. vaginalis and a. tetradius) were further identified to the species level using multiplex pcr assays (multiplex pcr-ia and multiplex pcr-ib). similarly, five species of the genus peptoniphilus (pn. asaccharolyticus, pn. harei, pn. indolicus, pn. ivorii and pn. lacrimalis) were identified to the species level using multiplex pcr-iia and multiplex pcr-iib. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 190 clinical isolates of gpac species that had been identified previously to the  species level by 16s rrna sequencing and phenotypic tests. the identification obtained from multiplex pcr assays showed 100 % agreement with 16s rdna sequencing identification, but only 65 % (123/190) agreement with the identification obtained by phenotypic tests. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of gpac species. it will permit a more accurate assessment of the role of various gpac species in infection and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.

TI  == heterogeneity within the gram-positive anaerobic cocci demonstrated by analysis of 16s-23s intergenic ribosomal rna polymorphisms.
AB  == peptostreptococci are gram-positive, strictly anaerobic bacteria which, although  regarded as members of the commensal human microflora, are also frequently isolated from sites of clinical infection. the study of this diverse group of opportunist pathogens has been hindered by an inadequate taxonomy and the lack of a valid identification scheme. recent re-classification of the peptostreptococcus family into five distinct genus groups has helped to clarify the situation. however, this has been on the basis of 16s rrna sequence determinations, which are both time-consuming and expensive. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of pcr-amplified ribosomal dna spacer polymorphisms for the rapid differentiation of the currently recognised taxa within the group of anaerobic gram-positive cocci. a collection comprising 19 reference strains with  representatives of each of the 15 species, two close relatives and two of the well-characterised groups, together with 38 test strains was studied. all strains were identified to species group level by phenotypic means. amplification of the  16s-23s intergenic spacer region (isr) with universal primers produced distinct banding patterns for all the 19 reference strains and the patterns could be differentiated easily visually. however, of the 38 test strains, less than half could be speciated from isr analysis alone. only five groups produced correlating banding patterns for all members tested (peptoniphilus lacrimalis, p. ivorii, anaerococcus octavius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micromonas micros). for  other species, either the type strain differed significantly from other species members (e.g., a. hydrogenalis) or there appeared to be considerable intra-species variation (e.g., a. vaginalis). partial 16s rrna gene sequences for the 'trisimilis' and 'betagal' groups showed that both are most closely related to the anaerococcus group. this work highlights the heterogeneous nature of a number of peptostreptococcus species and hence the need for still further revision of the taxonomy of this important group of pathogens.

TI  == proposal of the genera anaerococcus gen. nov., peptoniphilus gen. nov. and gallicola gen. nov. for members of the genus peptostreptococcus.
AB  == members of genus peptostreptococcus have previously been found to be distantly related to the type species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, on the basis of 16s rdna sequence similarities. they were divided into three major phylogenetic groups, and their peptidoglycan structure and biochemical traits differed between groups. the reclassification of the species of these three groups into three new  genera, peptoniphilus gen. nov., anaerococcus gen. nov. and gallicola gen. nov.,  is proposed. the genus peptoniphilus gen. nov. includes the following butyrate-producing, non-saccharolytic species that use peptone and amino acids as major energy sources: peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus comb. nov. (type species), peptoniphilus lacrimaris comb. nov., peptoniphilus harei comb. nov., peptoniphilus indolicus comb. nov. and peptoniphilus ivorii comb. nov. the genus  anaerococcus gen. nov. contains the saccharolytic, butyrate-producing species anaerococcus prevotii comb. nov. (type species), anaerococcus tetradius comb. nov., anaerococcus lactolyticus comb. nov., anaerococcus hydrogenalis comb. nov., anaerococcus vaginalis comb. nov. and anaerococcus octavius sp. nov. the genus gallicola gen. nov. contains a single species, gallicola barnesae comb. nov.
