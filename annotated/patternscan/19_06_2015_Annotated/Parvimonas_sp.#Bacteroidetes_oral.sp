TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == the effect of a supragingival plaque-control regimen on the subgingival microbiota in smokers and never-smokers: evaluation by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of strict supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota in smokers and never-smokers. research into the impact of supragingival plaque control on the number of subgingival bacteria has resulted in contradictory findings. real-time  polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been suggested as a valid alternative to current microbiologic methods based on bacteria cultures. methods: forty-five subjects with chronic periodontitis were selected. twenty-four of them had never  smoked, and 21 were active smokers. four sites per patient were selected for sampling. supragingival debridement was performed at baseline, and the subjects received weekly instructions on oral hygiene for 180 days. a clinical examination and subgingival plaque sampling were carried out at baseline and at 30, 90, and 180 days. a real-time pcr assay was used to detect and quantify porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas  micros), dialister pneumosintes, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and the total bacteria load (eubacteria) in the subgingival samples. statistical analysis was performed using linear models adjusted for the clustering of observations within individuals. results: smokers and never-smokers exhibited a similar and significant reduction  in total bacteria counts over time. irrespective of smoking status, deep sites consistently harbored greater quantities of total bacteria throughout the study.  higher numbers of the bacteria investigated were associated with bleeding on probing. conclusion: supragingival plaque control markedly reduced subgingival microbiota counts in smokers and never-smokers.

TI  == correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  == background: there is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. this study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp) levels in older persons. methods: elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [ap]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (pd) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [sp]), if they did not. groups were compared with respect to demographics, pd, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hscrp, interleukin (il)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. results: ten ap and 24 sp subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the ap group (p <0.05). most asians were sp; most whites and all african americans were classified as having ap (p <0.01). more ap elders had osteoporosis (p <0.01), but the ap and sp groups did not differ with respect to il-1beta and -6 or hscrp. bacterial counts  were higher in the ap group for parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), and streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01). three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: pd, osteoporosis, and being white or african american. conclusion: periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, pd,  gender, serum hscrp, and levels of four bacterial species.

TI  == comparative analysis of endodontic pathogens using checkerboard hybridization in  relation to culture.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of this study was to detect bacterial species and to  quantify the total number of bacteria from samples of infected root canals before (s1) and after chemo-mechanical preparation using 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gel as auxiliary chemical substance (s2) and after 7 days of intracanal dressing (s3) to compare microbial changes. method: twenty-four teeth were selected for this study. chemo-mechanical preparation was performed using 2% chx gel, then three different intracanal medicaments [m1: ca(oh)(2) paste; m2: 2% chx gel; and m3: ca(oh)(2) paste plus 2% chx gel] were used for 7 days. checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was performed to detect 40 bacterial species. aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques were used to determine the bacterial community by counting the colony-forming units (cfu). results: the species most frequently identified by checkerboard in s1 were: fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, treponema socranskii ssp. socranskii, parvimonas micra and enterococcus faecalis. in s2 and s3 a total of eight different species were identified; and only one of them was gram-positive (e. faecalis). microorganisms were not identified after use of m2 for 7 days. the quantification obtained on agar plates ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(6) cfu/ml in s1, mean cfu was reduced by 99.96% in s2, and there was no  statistical difference between the cfu in s2 and s3. conclusion: the antibacterial effect of the mechanical preparation supplemented by the use of an  antibacterial auxiliary substance greatly reduced the microorganisms in the main  root canal.
