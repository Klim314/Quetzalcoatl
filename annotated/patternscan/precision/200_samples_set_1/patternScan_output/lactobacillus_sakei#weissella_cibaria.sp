TI  == isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == lactobacillus pobuzihii is a novel species which has been previously found in pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in taiwan. however, the lactic acid bacteria (lab) microflora in pobuzihi has not been studied in detail. in this study, lab from pobuzihi were isolated, identified, and characterized. a total of 196 lab were isolated; 79 cultures were isolated from the sample collected from a manufacturing factory, 38 from pobuzihi samples  collected from 4 different markets, and 79 from 2 fresh cummingcordia samples. these isolates were characterized phenotypically and then divided into eight groups (a to h) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant lab found in most samples during the fermentation of pobuzihi. on the other hand, enterococcus casseliflavus and weissella cibaria were, respectively, the major species found in the two fresh cummingcordia samples. a potential novel species or subspecies of lactococcal strain was found. in addition, seven l. plantarum and five w. cibaria strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t). this is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of lab existing in the pobuzihi during its fermentation process and the final product on the market.

TI  == isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from yan-jiang (fermented  ginger), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == background: yan-jiang (fermented ginger) is a popular traditional fermented food  in taiwan. the lactic acid bacteria (lab) microflora in yan-jiang has not been studied in detail. in this study, lab from yan-jiang were isolated, characterised and identified. results: a total of 176 lab were isolated; 160 cultures were isolated from yan-jiang samples and 16 cultures were isolated from raw ginger. these isolates were characterised phenotypically and then divided into nine groups (a to i) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. lactobacillus sakei and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis were the major lab found in the initial 2 days of fermentation without pickled plums; these species were mostly replaced by weissella cibaria and l. plantarum after 3 days of fermentation. in the fermentation bucket with added pickled plums, w. cibaria was the most abundant lab found during fermentation. the antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined. twenty-four lc. lactis subsp. lactis and 19 w. cibaria strains showed inhibitory  activity against the indicator strain l. sakei jcm 1157(t) . conclusion: results  demonstrate that various lab species were more numerous when fermentation was carried out without pickled plums. lab also had effects on the aroma and flavour  of yan-jiang.
