TI  - The subgingival microbiota of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. This comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with PLS used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) clonal analysis and the 16S rRNA-based Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: Thirteen patients with PLS from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. Subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic DNA was extracted. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the HOMIM. RESULTS: The most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Lachnospiraceae OT 100 (EI074), Parvimonas micra, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. As a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. In the HOMIM analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with PLS. Of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. The high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter spp., Capnocytophaga granulosa, G. morbillorum, P. micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Streptococcus spp., and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota in PLS is diverse. Periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development of severe periodontitis in patients with PLS.
TI  - Evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. METHODS: The study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the Philippe Pinel Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the CAGE (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (WHO). Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (PD) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with PD < 4 mm. The presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed using the checkerboard technique. RESULTS: The prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. However, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of Aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). Moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of Capnocytophaga sputigena, Fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, F. nuc. nucleatum, Gemella morbillorum, Neisseria mucosa, P. gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Tannerella forsythia at sites with PD < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). Of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented significantly higher mean levels of F. nuc. vincentii, F. nuc nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and T. forsythia than sites with PD >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.
TI  - Comparison of the use of the Halimeter and the Oral Chroma in the assessment of the ability of common cultivable oral anaerobic bacteria to produce malodorous volatile sulfur compounds from cysteine and methionine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the use of the Halimeter and the Oral Chroma to assess the  ability of common oral anaerobic bacteria isolated from the Kuwaiti population to produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Broth cultures of common anaerobes isolated from supragingival plaque were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in phosphate buffer (pH 7.7) with an optical density OD(550) of 0.3. 100 mul of this suspension and 870 mul of buffer were added in 2 sterile 15-ml head space vials. Reaction was initiated by addition of 30 mul of 33 mML-methionine and L-cysteine, respectively, in each vial and incubation at 37 degrees C for 90 min. 500 mul of 3 M phosphoric acid was added to tubes and was kept aside for 10 min. Production of VSCs was measured using the Halimeter and the Oral Chroma. RESULTS: The major VSC producers identified by both Halimeter and Oral Chroma with L-cystenine as substrate were Campylobacter ureolyticus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Gemella morbillorum. The concentrations of hydrogen sulfide recorded by both Halimeter and Oral Chroma were essentially identical. With L-methionine as substrate, both Halimeter and Oral Chroma identified different complements of anaerobes with C. ureolyticus,P. gingivalis,Fusobacterium nucleatum and P. intermedia as major VSC producers. The concentrations of methyl mercaptan recorded by the Halimeter were lower compared to those assessed by the Oral Chroma. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the Oral Chroma may produce a more comprehensive assessment of VSC production by oral microflora than the Halimeter.
TI  - Subgingival plaque microbiota in HIV positive patients.
AB  - AIM: To describe and compare the predominant bacterial and fungal species associated with gingivitis, periodontitis, and linear gingival erythema (LGE), in HIV positive subjects with different immune status. METHODS: Viral loads and CD4 levels determined HIV disease status. From pooled subgingival plaque, 16S and 18S rDNA were cloned and sequenced to determine species identity. RESULTS: One hundred and nine bacterial species were identified from 14 subjects. Nearly half of the species were not cultivable. Notably, the classical putative periodontal pathogens, Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia were below the limit of detection and were not detected. Species of Gemella, Dialister, Streptococcus and Veillonella were predominant. In one HIV positive subject with periodontitis and low viral load, Gemella morbillorum, a known opportunistic pathogen, constituted 84% of the clones. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the only fungal species detected in an LGE subject and in periodontitis subjects with high viral loads. In periodontitis patients with low viral loads, Candida albicans was predominant, while S. cerevisiae was only a minor component. CONCLUSION: These case studies suggest that other bacterial species, rather than the classical periodontal pathogens, may be involved in periodontal diseases of subjects with HIV. These data are indicative of opportunistic infections in a highly susceptible immunocompromised host.
