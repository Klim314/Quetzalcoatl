TI  == cyclohexane-1,2-dione hydrolase from denitrifying azoarcus sp. strain 22lin, a novel member of the thiamine diphosphate enzyme family.
AB  == alicyclic compounds with hydroxyl groups represent common structures in numerous  natural compounds, such as terpenes and steroids. their degradation by microorganisms in the absence of dioxygen may involve a c-c bond ring cleavage to form an aliphatic intermediate that can be further oxidized. the cyclohexane-1,2-dione hydrolase (cdh) (ec 3.7.1.11) from denitrifying azoarcus sp. strain 22lin, grown on cyclohexane-1,2-diol as a sole electron donor and carbon source, is the first thiamine diphosphate (thdp)-dependent enzyme characterized to date that cleaves a cyclic aliphatic compound. the degradation of cyclohexane-1,2-dione (cdo) to 6-oxohexanoate comprises the cleavage of a c-c  bond adjacent to a carbonyl group, a typical feature of reactions catalyzed by thdp-dependent enzymes. in the subsequent nad(+)-dependent reaction, 6-oxohexanoate is oxidized to adipate. cdh has been purified to homogeneity by the criteria of gel electrophoresis (a single band at approximately 59 kda; calculated molecular mass, 64.5 kda); in solution, the enzyme is a homodimer ( approximately 105 kda; gel filtration). as isolated, cdh contains 0.8 +/- 0.05 thdp, 1.0 +/- 0.02 mg(2+), and 1.0 +/- 0.015 flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) per monomer as a second organic cofactor, the role of which remains unclear. strong reductants, ti(iii)-citrate, na(+)-dithionite, and the photochemical 5-deazaflavin/oxalate system, led to a partial reduction of the fad chromophore.  the cleavage product of cdo, 6-oxohexanoate, was also a substrate; the corresponding cyclic 1,3- and 1,4-diones did not react with cdh, nor did the cis- and trans-cyclohexane diols. the enzymes acetohydroxyacid synthase (ahas) from saccharomyces cerevisiae, pyruvate oxidase (pox) from lactobacillus plantarum, benzoylformate decarboxylase from pseudomonas putida, and pyruvate decarboxylase  from zymomonas mobilis were identified as the closest relatives of cdh by comparative amino acid sequence analysis, and a thdp binding motif and a 2-fold rossmann fold for fad binding could be localized at the c-terminal end and central region of cdh, respectively. a first mechanism for the ring cleavage of cdo is presented, and it is suggested that the fad cofactor in cdh is an evolutionary relict.

TI  == identification of yeast and bacteria involved in the mezcal fermentation of agave salmiana.
AB  == aims: to identify the yeast and bacteria present in the mezcal fermentation from  agave salmiana. methods and results: the restriction and sequence analysis of the amplified region, between 18s and 28s rdna and 16s rdna genes, were used for the  identification of yeast and bacteria, respectively. eleven different micro-organisms were identified in the mezcal fermentation. three of them were the following yeast: clavispora lusitaniae, pichia fermentans and kluyveromyces marxianus. the bacteria found were zymomonas mobilis subsp. mobilis and zymomonas mobilis subsp. pomaceae, weissella cibaria, weissella paramesenteroides, lactobacillus pontis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus farraginis. conclusions: the phylogenetic analysis of 16s rdna and  its sequences showed that microbial diversity present in mezcal is dominated by bacteria, mainly lactic acid bacteria species and zymomonas mobilis. pichia fermentans and k. marxianus could be micro-organisms with high potential for the  production of some volatile compounds in mezcal. significance and impact of the study: we identified the community of bacteria and yeast present in mezcal fermentation from agave salmiana.

TI  == crystal versus solution structures of thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes.
AB  == the quaternary structures of the thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes transketolase (ec 2.2.1.1; from saccharomyces cerevisiae), pyruvate oxidase (ec 1.2.3.3; from lactobacillus plantarum), and pyruvate decarboxylase (ec 4.1.1.1; from zymomonas mobilis and brewers' yeast, the latter in the native and pyruvamide-activated forms) were examined by synchrotron x-ray solution scattering. the experimental scattering data were compared with the curves calculated from the crystallographic models of these multisubunit enzymes. for all enzymes noted above, except the very compact pyruvate decarboxylase from z. mobilis, there were significant differences between the experimental and calculated profiles. the changes in relative positions of the subunits in solution were determined by rigid body refinement. for pyruvate oxidase and transketolase, which have tight intersubunit contacts in the crystal, relatively  small modifications of the quaternary structure (root mean square displacements of 0.23 and 0.27 nm, respectively) sufficed to fit the experimental data. for the enzymes with looser contacts (the native and activated forms of yeast pyruvate decarboxylase), large modifications of the crystallographic models (root mean square displacements of 0.58 and 1.53 nm, respectively) were required. a clear correlation was observed between the magnitude of the distortions induced by the  crystal environment and the interfacial area between subunits.

TI  == isoprenoid biosynthesis in bacteria: two different pathways?
AB  == the biosynthesis of isopentenylpyrophosphate, a central intermediate of isoprenoid formation, was investigated in six different bacterial organisms. cell-free extracts of myxococcus fulvus, staphylococcus carnosus, lactobacillus plantarum and halobacterium cutirubrum converted [14c]acetyl-coa or [14c]hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa to [14c]mevalonic acid. furthermore, [14c]mevalonic acid, [14c]mevalonate-5-phosphate and [14c]mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate were metabolized to [14c]isopentenylpyrophosphate. these data demonstrated the in vitro operation of  acetoacetate pathway for the formation of isopentenylpyrophosphate in bacteria. in contrast, no intermediates of this reaction sequence could be detected using cell-free extracts of zymomonas mobilis and escherichia coli. these results indicate that at least two different pathways for the biosynthesis of isopentenylpyrophosphate are present in bacteria.

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp. (0.98%),micrococcus sp. (0.82%),serratia marcescens (0.81%),bacillus subtilis (0.57%),cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),erwinia sp. (0.37%),zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),bacillus sp. (0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.
