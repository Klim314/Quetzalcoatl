TI  == aerobic microbial community of insectary population of phlebotomus papatasi.
AB  == background: microbes particularly bacteria presenting in the gut of haematophagous insects may have an important role in the epidemiology of human infectious disease. methods: the microbial flora of gut and surrounding environmental of a laboratory strain of phlebotomus papatasi, the main vector of  zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) in the old world, was investigated. biochemical reactions and 16s rdna sequencing of the isolated bacteria against 24 sugars and amino acids were used for bacteria species identification. common mycological media used for fungi identification as well. results: most isolates belonged to the enterobacteriaceae, a large, heterogeneous group of gram-negative rods whose natural habitat is the intestinal tract of humans and animals. enterobacteriaceae groups included edwardsiella, enterobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, kluyvera, leminorella, pantoea, proteus, providencia, rahnella, serratia, shigella, tatumella, and yersinia and non enterobacteriaceae groups included bacillus, staphylococcus and pseudomonas. the most prevalent isolates were proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris. these saprophytic and swarming motile bacteria were isolated from all immature, pupae, and mature fed or unfed male or  female sand flies as well as from larval and adult food sources. five fungi species were also isolated from sand flies, their food sources and colonization materials where candida sp. was common in all mentioned sources. conclusion: midgut microbiota are increasingly seen as an important factor for modulating vector competence in insect vectors so their possible effects of the mirobiota on the biology of p. papatasi and their roles in the sandfly-leishmania interaction  are discussed.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamases in faecal enterobacteriaceae recovered from healthy humans in spain: focusing on ampc polymorphisms.
AB  == the intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampc genes in species of citrobacter, enterobacter or escherichia genera. in this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampc beta-lactamase  genes. fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 escherichia coli, 4 citrobacter braakii, 9 citrobacter freundii, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 proteus vulgaris, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 serratia sp. and 1 cronobacter sp. a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the ampc phenotype in 22  isolates (31 %) and the esbl phenotype in 3 isolates. ampc molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla cmy and bla act genes from citrobacter and enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. the prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampc genes obtained in this study was 2 %. the unique plasmid-mediated bla ampc identified in this study was the bla cmy-2 gene, detected in an e. coli isolate ascribed to  the sequence type st405 which belonged to phylogenetic group d. the hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the isecp1-bla cmy-2-blc structure  was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable inck plasmid. this study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. extensive ampc-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.

TI  == detection of persistent organic compounds from biomethanated distillery spent wash (bmds) and their degradation by manganese peroxidase and laccase producing bacterial strains.
AB  == biomethanated distillery spent wash (bmds) retains dark black colour with complex persistent organic pollutants even after anaerobic treatment. the specific ratio  (4:3:1:1) of proteus mirabilis (fj581028), bacillus sp. (fj581030), raoultella planticola (gu329705) and enterobacter sakazakii (fj581031) decolourised bmds up  to 76% within 192 hr along with degradation of persistent organic compounds in presence of glucose (1%) and peptone (0.1%). the colour removal ability was noted due to ligninolytic enzyme activity. where the maximum manganese peroxidase was 1.93 u ml(-1) and laccase activity equalled 0.84 u ml(-1). the gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (gc-ms) analysis confirmed the direct correlation between colourant and persistent organic pollutants due to simultaneous reduction of colour and pollutants present in bmds. the seed germination test showed reduction of 75% toxicity after bacterial treatment process.

TI  == emergence of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1) producing and multidrug resistant uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in andaman islands, india.
AB  == the present study was undertaken to understand the distribution and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens in the remote islands of india. patients' demographical data, urine culture results, and resistance rates were analyzed and multidrug resistant isolates were characterized. significant bacteriuria was found in 16 (17.7%, 95% confidence interval [ci] 8.47-23.53%) samples, which includes escherichia coli 9 (56.3%); klebsiella pneumoniae 3 (18.8%); enterobacter sp. 2 (12.5%) and proteus mirabilis 2 (12.5%). the uropathogens showed a wide resistance involving 3-21 drugs with 15 different  resistance patterns. among the 16 isolates, 13 (81.3%, 95% ci 62.13-100.37%) and  11 (68.8%, 95% ci 46.04-91.46%) isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins, respectively. multiple mutations were detected in quinolone resistance determining region (qrdr) of the fluoroquinolone resistant isolates and all third generation cephalosporin resistant isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a total of 7 (44%, 95% ci 17.02-70.98%) isolates was found to harbor plasmid mediated quinolone resistance  determinants the present study reports for the first time the presence of the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm-1) gene in two isolates of p. mirabilis in these islands. detection of multidrug resistant and ndm-1 producing isolates from cases of urinary tract infection in these remote islands lends support to the belief that the existence of these highly resistant strains is perhaps more widespread than previously thought and underscores the need for immediate implementation of antibiotic policy integrated with a continuous surveillance system. the study strengthens the need for a continuous surveillance system of antibiotic resistance in these remote islands.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  == abstract. a method, based on raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed.  spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (gram-negative: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, and gram-positive: staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a raman spectrometer with a fiber raman probe (830 nm). colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for raman measurements. after preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and mahalanobis distance (pca/md) discrimination algorithm. we found that the mean raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and s. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. pca/md could discriminate gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of 6,296 enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates collected at a tertiary care university hospital in greece.
AB  == the reevaluation of "forgotten" antibiotics can identify new therapeutic options  against extensively drug-resistant gram-negative pathogens. we sought to investigate isepamicin in this regard. we retrospectively evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of enterobacteriaceae sp. isolates from unique patients, collected at the microbiological laboratory of the university hospital of heraklion, crete, greece, from 2004 to 2009. susceptibility testing was done with the automated vitek 2 system. the breakpoints for susceptibility to isepamicin, tigecycline, and other antibiotics  were those proposed by the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm), the fda, and the clsi, respectively. a total of 6,296 isolates were studied, including primarily 3,401 (54.0%) escherichia coli, 1,040  (16.5%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 590 (9.4%) proteus mirabilis, and 460 (7.3%) enterobacter sp. isolates. excluding the species with intrinsic resistance to each antibiotic, antimicrobial susceptibility was highest for colistin (5,275/5,441 isolates [96.9%]) and isepamicin (6,103/6,296 [96.9%]), followed by  meropenem (5,890/6,296 [93.6%]), imipenem (5,874/6,296 [93.3%]), and amikacin (5,492/6,296 [87.2%]). the antimicrobial susceptibility of the 1,040 k. pneumoniae isolates was highest for isepamicin (95.3%), followed by colistin (89.3%) and meropenem (63.0%). regarding resistant k. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to isepamicin was observed for 91.1% of the 392, 87.7% of the 375, and 85.6% of the 111 isolates that were nonsusceptible to the carbapenems, all other aminoglycosides, and colistin, respectively. isepamicin exhibited high in vitro activity against almost all of the enterobacteriaceae species. it could particularly serve as a last-resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae in our region, where it is endemic, as it does not show considerable cross-resistance with other aminoglycosides.

TI  == antimicrobial activities against biofilm formed by proteus mirabilis isolates from wound and urinary tract infections.
AB  == background: bacterial species are capable of living as biofilm and/or planktonic  forms. there is increasing evidence for the role of bacterial biofilm in various  wound and urinary tract infections (utis). the aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of the bacteria, isolated from urinary tract infections (utis) and wound infections, to form biofilm and correlate the role of biofilm with their antimicrobial resistance. materials and methods: all the isolated bacteria were screened for their ability to form biofilm using the microtitre plate method. results: wound isolates of staphylococcus aureus and enterobacter sp. had more biofilm forming capacity than the uti isolates. proteus mirabilis isolates were among the strongest biofilm forming bacteria and were chosen for antimicrobial study. in sub-mic concentrations of antimicrobial agents used, ciprofloxacin was found to be the most effective in decreasing biofilm formation. on the other hand, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were effective in partial removal of preformed biofilm biomass. conclusion: ciprofloxacin was more effective in killing bacterial cells especially at high antimicrobial concentrations that could be reached in urine levels and can be used in impregenating catheters.

TI  == biodegradation of organic compounds of molasses melanoidin (mm) from biomethanated distillery spent wash (bmds) during the decolourisation by a potential bacterial consortium.
AB  == molasses melanoidin (mm) is a major pollutant in biomethanated distillery spent wash (bmds) due to its recalcitrant properties. the 75% colour and 71% cod of mm  (1,000 ppm) were reduced with developed bacterial consortium comprising proteus mirabilis (iitrm5; fj581028), bacillus sp. (iitrm7; fj581030), raoultella planticola (iitrm15; gu329705) and enterobacter sakazakii (iitrm16, fj581031) in  the ratio of 4:3:2:1 within 10 days at optimized nutrient. bacterial consortium showed manganese peroxidase and laccase activity during mm decolourisation. the dominant growth of r. planticola and e. sakazakii was noted in consortium during  mm decolourisation. the comparative gc-ms analysis of extracted compounds of control and degraded samples showed that most of the compounds present in control were completely utilized by bacterial consortium along with production of some metabolites. the developed bacterial consortium could be a tool for the decolourisation and degradation of melanoidin containing bmds.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in brazil.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. in this study, 127 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at sao paulo, brazil, were submitted to analysis by pcr  with specific primers for bla shv, bla tem and bla ctx-m genes. from the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%)  morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) enterobacter cloacae were identified as esbl producers. bla shv, bla tem and bla ctx-m were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of k. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. pcr results showed a high variety of esbl groups among strains, in nine different species. the results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == simvastatin improves the healing of infected skin wounds of rats.
AB  == purpose: this study explores the potential of the simvastatin to ameliorate inflammation and infection in open infected skin wounds of rats. methods: fourteen wistar rats weighing 285 +/- 12g were used. the study was done in a group whose open infected skin wounds were treated with topical application of simvastatin microemulsion (sim, n=7) and a second group with wounds treated with  saline 0.9 % (sal, n=7). a bacteriological exam of the wounds fluid for gram positive and gram negative bacteria, the tecidual expression of tnfa and il-1a by immunohistochemical technique, and histological analysis by he stain were performed. results: the expression of tnfa could be clearly demonstrated in lower degree in skin wounds treated with simvastatin (668.6 +/- 74.7 im(2)) than in saline (2120.0 +/-327.1 im(2)). in comparison, wound tissue from sim group displayed leukocyte infiltration significantly lower than that observed in sal group (p<0.05). culture results of the samples taken from wound fluid on fourth post treatment day revealed wound infection in only one rat of group simvastatin  (sim), where proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and enterobacter sp were isolated. in the rats whose wounds were treated with saline (sal), polymicrobial  infection with more than 100,000 cfu/g was detected in all the wounds. conclusion: in addition to its antiinflammatory properties, the protective effects of simvastatin in infected open skin wounds is able to reduce infection and probably has antibacterial action. the potential to treat these wounds with statins to ameliorate inflammation and infection is promising.

AB  == mexican tarragon (tagetes lucida cv. asteraceae: campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from ch2cl2 and meoh  extracts from aerial parts of t. lucida. in addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin  (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (sigma-aldrich). all of these compounds and extracts (m1 and m2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. the antibacterial activity was determined on bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, salmonella sp., shigella boydii, shigella sp., enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans,  sarcina lutea, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterolitica, vibrio cholerae (three el tor strains, cdc-v12, clinic case, and indre-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and v. cholerae (no-o1). the evaluated fungi were aspergillus niger, penicillium notatum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium sporotrichum, rhizoctonia solani, and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most active compounds against gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. in addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against v. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. coumarins were the most effective compounds against gram-negative bacteria. the extract meoh/ch2cl2 (1: 4) m2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of e. coli and p. mirabilis (40%), k. pneumoniae (31.1%), salmonella sp. (35.5%), and shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. the dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal  strains, especially t. mentagrophytes and r. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0  and 250.0 microg/ml, respectively).

TI  == cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == [the resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  == clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. the resistance of 50  strains each of methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus sp. (p. mirabilis 25 strains and p. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (isp), amikacin (amk), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against p. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. isp was effective against all strains except for 14% of mrsa, 2% of proteus sp., and 4% of p. aeruginosa. 2. six strains of mrsa were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases isp exhibited a relatively  low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) compared to the other compounds. 3. four strains of mrsa were resistant to all drugs except isp. mrsa was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. twenty-one strains of mrsa and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both isp and amk. 5. against all strains tested, isp generally exhibited a lower mic compared to amk. these results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, isp is still an aminoglycoside having a  high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

TI  == identification of a common structural motif in the disordered n-terminal region of bacterial flagellins--evidence for a new class of fibril-forming peptides.
AB  == flagellin proteins lacking the n- or c-terminus form polymers of reduced filament stability and straight morphology, in contrast to the coiled native flagella. in  the present study, the n-terminal amino acid sequence of flagellins of the anaerobic beer spoilage bacteria pectinatus cerevisiiphilus and pectinatus frisingiensis as well as enterobacter aerogenes and pseudomonas sp. were determined. sequence similarity was revealed between these and the n-termini of all known eubacterial flagellins. synthetic peptides corresponding to the first 15 amino acid residues of the flagellins of pectinatus, campylobacter jejuni, e.  aerogenes or proteus mirabilis flagellins had a spontaneous tendency under physiological conditions to form 4-6 nm broad, 1-2 microm long fibrillar structures that had a tendency to form clusters. in contrast, the pectinatus peptide missing residues 1-3 did not form fibrils. the peptide missing residues 13-15 formed fibrils less easily, and the peptide missing residues 11-15 formed fibrils almost without clustering. in electron micrographs, the fibrillisation of the bacterial flagellar peptides resembled that of beta-amyloid and prion peptides. 1h-nmr and infrared spectroscopy studies with homology analysis indicate that although the flagellar n-terminal peptides are flexible with many conformational minima, they have a significant tendency to form beta-type structures and a loop in the middle of the peptide. the hydrophobic character of  the n-terminus together with the property of forming a conserved beta-strand-loop-beta-strand motif may be related to a mechanism involved in attaining the proper morphology and stability of the flagellar filament, by providing a device for facilitating the attachment of the flagellin monomers to each other. the flagellar peptides represent a new class of fibril-forming peptides.

TI  == [evaluation of in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against 569 gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == objective: evaluation of the in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against gram-negative bacteria. material and method: a total of 569 clinical isolates were obtained from inpatients at sao paulo hospital--unifesp/epm in june and july of 1992. the species distribution was as follows: enterobacter sp. (62), escherichia coli (308), klebsiella pneumoniae (27), klebsiella sp. (9), proteus mirabilis (23), pseudomonas aeruginosa (88), pseudomonas sp. (4), serratia sp. (30) and other gram-negatives  (7). susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution. the antimicrobials agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, du 6859-alpha, ceftazidime, cefepime, fk 037, imipenem, meropenem  and biapenem. results: du 6859-alpha showed the highest anti-microbial activity among the fluoroquinolones. it was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against some species. the potency and antimicrobial spectrum were similar between the fourth-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae,  except for enterobacter sp. strains which were more susceptible to cefepime than  they were to cefetazidime or fk 037. when testing pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was slightly more active than the other cephalosporins. against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, meropenem was more active  than imipenem or biapenem. in addition, the percentage of strains, susceptible to meropenem was higher than the percentage susceptible to the other cerbapenems against these species. conclusion: the new antimicrobial agents demonstrated in vitro activity higher than that of agents commercially available. however, more studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo activity and the clinical benefit of these compounds.

TI  == the management of lateral sinus thrombosis.
AB  == the standard recommended treatment for lateral sinus thrombosis is intravenous antibiotics. for those that fail, some authors recommend anticoagulant therapy, others internal jugular vein ligation. despite these recommendations, there is still a significant mortality in all reported large series and the main reason this is that the cause of the failure has not been found or investigated. over a  six-year-period, from january 1985 to december 1990, 36 patients were admitted with lateral sinus thrombosis. the initial treatment consisted of intravenous antibiotics and surgery. the surgery included cortical mastoidectomy for non-cholesteatomatous ears and modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatomatous ears and drainage of the intracranial collection of pus in patients with subdural empyema and brain abscess. there were nine failures (25 per cent) with this treatment regimen. blood cultures and pus swab of the ears were taken from these patients. the blood cultures were positive in four patients and the organisms isolated included beta-haemolytic streptococcus sp. in two, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pneumoniae in one each. from the ear swab mixed cultures were found in eight and a single organism in one. gram-negative organisms were isolated in nine (100 per cent), proteus mirabilis in eight (89 per cent) and enterobacter sp. in two. both these organisms were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin but were sensitive to amikacin. amikacin was then added to the treatment regimen and a dramatic response with a fall in the temperature,  and improvement in the patients' general condition was noted within 24 hours, in  all patients.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. thirty-two strains of pseudomonas and 960 strains of enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and salmonella enterica). tigemonam displayed good activity against enterobacteriaceae. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were as follows: mic50s were 0.01 mg/l for p. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/l for s. marcescens, mic90s were 0.03 mg/l for p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris and 4 mg/l for citrobacter freundii. tigemonam inhibited e. coli and p. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. despite mic90s of 9.5 and 4 mg/l for enterobacter and c. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. tigemonam was found to be inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, with mic50s and mic90s higher than 128 mg/l (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/l). tigemonam's activity was found to  be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against p. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (mic90, 8 mg/l for norfloxacin; mic50, 8 mg/l and mic90, 32 mg/l for aztreonam). cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == [in vitro activity of a new 3d-generation cephalosporin, cefodizime, on hospital  bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae mics ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode mic: 0.25); mode mics varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for citrobacter; mics ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for serratia. the rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were citrobacter or enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter, with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128. haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly  susceptible (mic less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low  mics (0.03-0.12). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.

AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

TI  == in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l.  pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than  or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant  to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == [cefotetan, a new cephamycin antibiotic: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities (author's transl)].
AB  == cefotetan (ctt) is a new parenteral semisynthetic cephamycin-type antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. against wide varieties of gram-negative bacteria, particularly including indole positive proteus, s. marcescens, enterobacter sp. and c. freundii ctt was more highly active than cefmetazole, cefoxitin and cefazolin. the 50% inhibition doses (id50) of ctt against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, indole positive proteus and s. marcescens were by far superior to those of the 3 other antibiotics. the antibacterial activities of ctt were bactericidal and were little affected by addition of horse serum and by variation in ph of the medium, in inoculum size and in type of culture media. model infections in mice against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were studied. the therapeutic effects after subcutaneous injection of ctt against various gram-negative bacterial infections were superior to those of cefmetazole, cefoxitin and cefazolin.

TI  == comparison of mezlocillin, piperacillin, bay k 4999 with carbenicillin and ticarcillin against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of five penicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and bay k 4999) against escherichia coli,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole positive proteus sp. and enterobacter species was determined by an agar dilution method. bay k 4999 and piperacillin were found to be the most active of the semi-synthetic penicillins tested against p. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. bay k 4999 was slightly more active than piperacillin against e. coli, about as active as piperacillin against pseudomonas, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis and indole positive proteus, but more active than piperacillin against enterobacter species.

TI  == a comparison of the in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, cefuroxime, and cephalothin against 810 clinical isolates.
AB  == 810 strains of eight species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp, enterobacter sp, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris, were tested by the disc diffusion method against  cephalothin and cefuroxime. the activity of the two drugs was comparable to s aureus and s epidermidis, and a little in favour of cefuroxime regarding s faecalis. cefuroxime turned out to be superior to cephalothin against the gram negative rods investigated. this pattern was most pronounced when enterobacter was investigated.

TI  == homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the mrna for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the ecori and one of the hindiii restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total dna from nine bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae: e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes,  edwardsiella tarda, serratia marcescens, and erwinia amylovora. however, among the enterobacteriaceae, dna from two species of proteus (p. mirabilis and p. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized  with the e. coli lipoprotein mrna. furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in  four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp. ho1-n, caulobacter crescentus, and myxococcus xanthus. envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified e. coli free-form lipoprotein in the ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. both species of proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. all of the above four bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-e. coli lipoprotein serum. from these results, the rate of  evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that  observed for various soluble enzymes of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == combined activitiy of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin against ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (brl 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. ticarcillin mics were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. thirty-nine strains of enterobacteriaceae tested included escherichia coli (14), klebsiella pneumoniae (16), citrobacter sp. (3), enterobacter sp. (3), salmonella enteritidis (1), serratia marcescens (1), and proteus mirabilis (1). ticarcillin mics for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. against 33 strains (85%), the mics were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. in contrast, the mics for seven of eight strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (mic >/= 2,048 mug/ml) e. coli, k. pneumoniae, enterobacter, and p. mirabilis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean mics of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. however, the mbc for penicillin-resistant s. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. all strains of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus mirabilis, and hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. eighty per cent of strains of h. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. most strains of enterobacter sp., indole-positive proteus, pseudomonas sp., and serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.

TI  == comparison of activity of sisomicin and gentamicin in mouse protection tests with gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the efficacy of sisomicin and gentamicin was compared in mouse protection studies against strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. there was no  significant difference in mortality of the mice in any of the protocol groups when five different dosages of sisomicin and gentamicin given by three separate schedules were compared for each bacterial inoculum in each antibiotic protocol.  the mean protective dose values of sisomicin were at least one-half those of gentamicin for each protocol against pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == epidemiologic aspects of nosocomial infections.
AB  == in a currently ongoing surveillance of hospital-associated infections in two metropolitan hospitals in oklahoma, the results over a four-month period suggest  at least tentative principles of host-agent relationships in hospital-associated  infections. within the urinary tract, the site with the highest number of total isolations, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common pathogens. by age, the under 5 and over 60 year age groups had the highest number of isolations. staphylococcus aureus and e coli were isolated more frequently in  the younger group, while k pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and proteus mirabilis occurred more frequently in infections among the older group. a higher frequency  of enterobacter sp and s aureus were isolated among male patients, while candida  albicans and e coli apparently had a greater affinity for females; however, none  of these differences by sex were statistically significant. over 50% of the infections were manifest within the first ten days of hospitalization.

TI  == in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics in patients of cefamandole, a new cephalsoporin antibiotic.
AB  == cefamandole nafate, a new cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro against 231 recent clinical isolates and in 12 patients. cefamandole had activity equivalent to cefazolin against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. cefamandole was more active than cephalothin or cefazolin against proteus mirabilis. both cefamandole and cefazolin were as active as cephalothin against s. aureus, were slightly more active against k. pneumoniae, and were considerably more active against e. coli. all strains of indole-positive proteus sp. were inhibited by 6.3 mug of cefamandole per ml but only 20% were inhibited by 25 mug of cefazolin or cephalothin per ml. eighty-eight percent of enterobacter sp. was inhibited by 25 mug of cefamandole per ml, but only 20 and 5% were inhibited by the same concentration of cefazolin  and cephalothin, respectively. peak levels of cefamandole ranged from 6.0 to 110  mug/ml in serum and levels ranged from 440 to 16,800 mug/ml in a 4- to 6-h collection of urine after a 500-mg or 1-g intramuscular dose (6.1 to 17.3 mg/kg)  in patients with endogenous creatinine clearances of >/=31 ml/min. these levels were done after the first dose, at mid-therapy, and at the end of therapy. there  was no evidence of accumulation with the 500-mg or 1-g dose given every 4 to 6 h. the percentage of the dose excreted in the urine within the first 4 to 6 h after  administration of cefamandole was >/=43%. the half-life of cefamandole in serum was 49 to 126 min.

TI  == [in vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
AB  == in vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (ab-pc), carbenicillin (cb-pc), sulbenicillin (sb-pc) cephalothin (cet), cefazolin (cez) and gentamicin (gm). fifty three % of escherichia coli strains 53.3% of citrobacter sp., 80% of proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of morganella and 80% of bacteroides sp. were susceptible (mic being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to ab-pc. the eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. cb-pc  and sb-pc were almost as effective as ab-pc against escherichia coli and citrobacter sp. they were less active against klebsiella sp., but more active against enterobacter sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus group and pseudomonas sp. than ab-pc, sb-pc was more effective than cb-pc against pseudomonas sp. the strains of pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of cb-pc and sb-pc were pyocyanine-negative strains. all strains (100%) of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp. and citrobacter sp. were susceptible to cet and cez, while none of enterobacter sp. , serratia sp., proteus vulgaris.  morganella, rettgerella, providencia and pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. the mics of cet and cez against bacteroides sp. were moderately low. some strains of providencia and alkaligenes sp. were resistant of gm but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high mics against bacteroides sp. when seen from the mic distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).

TI  == susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to combinations of antimicrobial agents in vitro.
AB  == combinations of either clindamycin or erythromycin with gentamicin, colimycin, or carbenicillin were studied for their antimicrobial effects on clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. no antagonistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were observed. synergistic effects of the antibiotic  combinations were noted against most strains of e. coli tested, especially when either clindamycin or erythromycin was combined with gentamicin or colimycin. of  16 other combinations of antibiotics examined with strains of e. coli as the test organisms, only the combination of penicillin g with either gentamicin or colimycin showed consistent synergy. the marked synergy of clindamycin combined with either gentamicin or colimycin was further demonstrated by following the kinetics of the bactericidal action of the antibiotic combinations and the effects on bacterial protein synthesis.

TI  == [a bacteriological study of otitis in dogs (author's transl)].
AB  == bacteriological examination of 100 cases of otitis in dogs revealed pure cultures of different microorganisms as follows: staphylococcus aureus from 25 animals; escherichia coli from 10; proteus mirabilis from 20; enterobacter sp. from 18 and klepsiella sp. from 7. mixed cultures of proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klepsiella sp. were found in 3 animals; staphylococcus aureus and  enterobacter sp. in 5; staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis in 4. enterobacter sp. and klepsiella sp. in 2 and staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli in 6. theses results indicated that staphylococcus aureus appeared as the most frequent microorganism (36%) followed by proteus mirabilis (23%) and klepsiella sp. (16%). drug resistance studies showed that all tested strains were resistant to the antibiotics and to the nalidixic acid in levels higher than 20microgram/ml except gentamycin which showed for pseudomonas  aeruginosa a resistance level for 10microgram/ml.

TI  == susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  == the susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. the three strains of listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. there was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of salmonellae, citrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas sp. cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus sp., providence sp., flavobacter sp., herellea vaginicola, and mima polymorpha. cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against bacteroides sp. thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
