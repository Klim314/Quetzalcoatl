TI  == transglucosylation potential of six sucrose phosphorylases toward different classes of acceptors.
AB  == in this study, the transglucosylation potential of six sucrose phosphorylase (sp) enzymes has been compared using eighty putative acceptors from different structural classes. to increase the solubility of hydrophobic acceptors, the addition of various co-solvents was first evaluated. all enzymes were found to retain at least 50% of their activity in 25% dimethylsulfoxide, with the enzymes  from bifidobacterium adolescentis and streptococcus mutans being the most stable. screening of the enzymes' specificity then revealed that the vast majority of acceptors are transglucosylated very slowly by sp, at a rate that is comparable to the contaminating hydrolytic reaction. the enzyme from s. mutans displayed the narrowest acceptor specificity and the one from leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b1355 the broadest. however, high activity could only be detected on l-sorbose and l-arabinose, besides the native acceptors d-fructose and phosphate. improving the affinity for alternative acceptors by means of enzyme engineering will, therefore, be a major challenge for the commercial exploitation of the transglucosylation potential of sucrose phosphorylase.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bifidobacterium spp. isolated from healthy adult koreans against cariogenic microflora.
AB  == objective: dental caries is the main common infectious disease in the human oral  cavity. streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were reported to be the most important etiological factors in human dental caries. thus, we examined the  inhibitory effects of bifidobacterium spp. cells and culture supernatants against s. mutans and s. sobrinus, including streptococcus gordonii, and aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, which is associated with periodontal disease. methods: mutans streptococci or a. actinomycetemcomitans and lactic acid bacteria (lab) were mixed in 1:1 ratio and then incubated for 90 min at 37 degrees c. after the  incubation, the viability of mutans streptococci or a. actinomycetemcomitans was  determined by plate count technique. we also investigated the morphological changes of s. mutans treated with lab using scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: in vitro viability of s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. gordonii, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was affected by human intestinal lab identified as bifidobacterium adolescentis spm1005 and bifidobacterium longum spm1207. especially, b. adolescentis spm1005 cells at 1.0 x 10(8) cfu had a strong growth-inhibiting effect against s. mutans and induced a 64% loss of its viability (p<0.05). in addition, swollen and disrupted s. mutans were observed after incubation with b. adolescentis spm1005. however, the culture supernatant of this strain did not show such inhibitory activity. conclusion: b. adolescentis spm1005 cells decreased the growth of s. mutans, which is a risk factor for dental caries. therefore, we suggest that this bifidobacterium strain may be a useful probiotic microorganism for prevention of dental caries that does not have adverse effects.
