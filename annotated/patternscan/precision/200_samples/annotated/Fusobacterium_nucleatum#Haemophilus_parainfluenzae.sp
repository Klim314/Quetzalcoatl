TI == pyrosequencing analysis of subgingival microbiota in distinct periodontal conditions.
AB == subgingival microorganisms are potentially associated with periodontal diseases.  however, changes in the subgingival microbiota during the progress of periodontal diseases are poorly understood. in this study, we analyzed bacterial communities in the subgingival paper point samples from 32 korean individuals with no sign of disease, gingivitis, or periodontitis using 454 flx titanium pyrosequencing. a total of 256,113 reads representing 26 phyla, 433 genera, and 1,016 species were detected. bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, synergistetes, and spirochaetes were the abundant phyla in periodontitis subjects, whereas firmicutes and proteobacteria were identified as the dominant phyla in the gingivitis and healthy subjects, respectively. although high levels of porphyromonas, fusobacterium, fretibacterium, rothia, filifactor, and treponema genera were observed in the periodontitis subjects, streptococcus, capnocytophaga, leptotrichia, and haemophilus genera were found at high frequency in the gingivitis subjects. species including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and fretibacterium fastidiosum were significantly increased in periodontitis subjects. on the other hand, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and leptotrichia hongkongensis were preferentially observed in the gingivitis subjects. intriguingly, the halophile halomonas hamiltonii was revealed as a predominant species in the healthy subjects. based on fast unifrac analysis, distinctive bacterial clusters were classified for the healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis state. the current findings might be useful for understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI == emergence of beta-lactamase producing anaerobic bacteria in the tonsils during penicillin treatment.
AB == the emergence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the microflora in the oropharyngeal cavity was studied in ten healthy volunteers treated with 1 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was also investigated. a significant increase in the number of beta-lactamase producing strains of bacteroides species and fusobacterium nucleatum was observed. one beta-lactamase producing staphylococcus aureus strain was recovered in one of the volunteers before the penicillin administration started and three staphylococcus aureus strains produced beta-lactamase after ten days of antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase-production in haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae or branhamella catarrhalis was not observed before, during or after the antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase activity was noted in the broth cultures from one volunteer colonized with a beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli strain. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was observed in all volunteers, the activity increasing significantly in parallel to the increase of beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was completely inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid and p-chloromercurbenzoate and about 70-80 per cent of the activity was inhibited by cefoxitin. the increase of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the oropharynx as a consequence of penicillin treatment raises doubt as to whether penicillin is the drug of choice in the treatment of tonsillitis caused by group a streptococci when previous treatment has failed.

TI == microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB == a study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces viscosus. streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. bacteriodes ochraceus, other bacteroides species, selenomonas sputigena, and campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. the data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. this might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.
