TI  == in vitro evaluation of antibacterial activities and anti-inflammatory effects of  bifidobacterium spp. addressing acne vulgaris.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect of bifidobacterium spp. in the first part of the study,  the antibacterial activities of live and sonicated cells, from a total of 23 bifidobacterium species, on the growth of 5 different strain of staphylococcus aureus. six strains, of sonicated bifidobacterium, exhibited antibacterial activity against staphylococci samples, and seven bifidobacterium strains exhibited antibacterial activity on the growth of s. aureus s.p.-n2. in the second part of the study, we tested the antimicrobial activity, of bifidobacterium against propionibacterium acne kctc3320, using the co-culture method. the loss of p. acnes viability, caused by b. adolescentis spm0308 and b.  longum spm1207, was 84% and 75%, respectively (*p < 0.05). in the third part of the study, the anti-inflammatory activity of b. adolescentis spm0308 and b. longum spm1207 were assessed; nitric oxide (no), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha  (tnf-alpha), production were tested using the murine macrophage raw 264.7 cell line. treatment of raw 264.7 cells, with bifidobacterium, decreased production of no and tnf-alpha rather than lps (100 ng/ml) treatment. the results suggest that  b. adolescentis spm0308 could be used as an effective control for p. acnes kctc3320, and s. aureus, and reduce the risk of acne vulgaris development. we suggest that b. adolescentis spm0308 may be a useful probiotic microorganism, for prevention of acne vulgaris, without adverse effects.

TI  == comparative analysis of mycobacterium and related actinomycetes yields insight into the evolution of mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis.
AB  == background: the sequence of the pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb) strain  h37rv has been available for over a decade, but the biology of the pathogen remains poorly understood. genome sequences from other mtb strains and closely related bacteria present an opportunity to apply the power of comparative genomics to understand the evolution of mtb pathogenesis. we conducted a comparative analysis using 31 genomes from the tuberculosis database (tbdb.org),  including 8 strains of mtb and m. bovis, 11 additional mycobacteria, 4 corynebacteria, 2 streptomyces, rhodococcus jostii rha1, nocardia farcinia, acidothermus cellulolyticus, rhodobacter sphaeroides, propionibacterium acnes, and bifidobacterium longum. results: our results highlight the functional importance of lipid metabolism and its regulation, and reveal variation between the evolutionary profiles of genes implicated in saturated and unsaturated fatty  acid metabolism. it also suggests that dna repair and molybdopterin cofactors are important in pathogenic mycobacteria. by analyzing sequence conservation and gene expression data, we identify nearly 400 conserved noncoding regions. these include 37 predicted promoter regulatory motifs, of which 14 correspond to previously validated motifs, as well as 50 potential noncoding rnas, of which we  experimentally confirm the expression of four. conclusions: our analysis of protein evolution highlights gene families that are associated with the adaptation of environmental mycobacteria to obligate pathogenesis. these families include fatty acid metabolism, dna repair, and molybdopterin biosynthesis. our analysis reinforces recent findings suggesting that small noncoding rnas are more common in mycobacteria than previously expected. our data provide a foundation for understanding the genome and biology of mtb in a comparative context, and are available online and through tbdb.org.

TI  == safety assessment of dairy microorganisms: propionibacterium and bifidobacterium.
AB  == the genera propionibacterium and bifidobacterium are clustered in the class actinobacteria and form the anaerobic branch of coryneform bacteria. the dairy propionibacteria comprising four species p. freudenreichii, p. acidipropionici, p. jensenii and p. thoenii are industrially important as starter cultures in hard-cheese ripening and recently also as protective bio-preservatives and probiotics. these four species are considered as safe whereas cutaneous propionibacterium species (also named "acnes group") are pathogens. in contrast,  bifidobacteria in fermented dairy products and milk powder are exclusively used as probiotics; selected strains of several species (out of more than thirty) contribute to this task. it has been only rarely found that commensal bifidobacteria have been connected with certain dental and other infections. consequently, only one single species, bifidobacterium dentium, is recognized as  pathogenic. genome sequence analysis of bifidobacterium longum and molecular biological analysis of other probiotic strains confirmed so far the absence of virulence and pathogenecity factors. however, tetracycline resistance genes tet(w), although probably not easy transferable, were found in bifidobacterium strains, also in bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, the worldwide most used  industrial strain. conclusively, strains from the propionibacterium and bifidobacterium species in dairy food generally represent so far no health hazards.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
