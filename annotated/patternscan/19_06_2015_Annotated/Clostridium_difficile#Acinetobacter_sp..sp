TI  == alert microorganisms isolated from patients hospitalized in malopolskie province  in 2010-2012.
AB  == objective: healthcare centers undertake supervisory activities to control health  care-associated infections (hcais) by elaborating procedures, identifying alert microorganisms and analyzing data collected. the aim of the study was to analyze  the prevalence of alert microorganisms in hospital wards in 2010-2012. material and methods: legislation which is in force since several years introduced the principles of health care-associated infections control and reporting system. analysis was based on annual reports on alert microorganisms provided by 19 district sanitary and epidemiological stations from malopolskie province. the data discuss positive tests results for alert microorganisms in patients who stayed in hospitals supervised by the sanitary and epidemiological stations. results: compared to 2010-2011, the number of tests per hospital bed in 2012 was  lower, amounting to 24 (2010 - 44, 2011 - 34). of these tests, the majority was performed in the following wards: transplantology (2010 - 339, 2011 - 354, 2012 - 330), burn care (2010 - 354, 2011 - 148, 2012 - 113) and icus for adults (2010 -  155, 2011 - 157, 2012 - 140). in 2010-2012, an increase in the number of positive test results for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esbl+) and clostridium difficile as well as slight decrease in the number of positive test results for other alert microorganisms were noted. the highest number of microorganisms was identified in neonatal and neonatal pathology (enterobacteriaceae esbl+); pediatric and infectious diseases (rotavirus); infectious diseases (rotavirus, c.difficile); burn care (acinetobacter baumanii,  pseudomonas sp.) and ophthalmic and hemodialysis wards (mrsa). conclusion: irrespective of a decrease in the number of tests per hospital bed in 2012, a high number of positive test results for alert microorganisms was observed. it suggests the necessity for wider application of collected data as to improve monitoring of infections and reduce resulting threats.

TI  == comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  == in this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (vb) and through cesarean section (cb) were investigated using culture-independent 16s rdna cloning and sequencing approach. the results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of vb infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart cb infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants  delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. the most abundant bacterial species present in vb infants were acinetobacter sp., bifidobacterium sp. and staphylococcus sp. however, cb infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with citrobacter sp., escherichia coli and clostridium difficile. the intestinal  microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of bifidobacteria species. an interesting finding of  our study was recovery of large number of acinetobacter sp. consisting of acinetobacter pittii (former acinetobacter genomic species 3), acinetobacter junii and acinetobacter baumannii in the vb infants clone library. among these, acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex. although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.

TI  == nosocomial infections and multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms in the pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  == nosocomial infections in pediatric intensive care units (picus) caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms are increasing. this review attempts to report on significant findings in the current literature related to nosocomial infections in picu settings with an international perspective. the types of nosocomial infections are addressed, including catheter-related bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections and post-surgical wound infections. a review of emerging resistant bacterial pathogens includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative organisms, klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains and multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii. basic and enhanced infection control methods for the management and control of multidrug-resistant organisms are also summarized with  an emphasis on prevention.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).
