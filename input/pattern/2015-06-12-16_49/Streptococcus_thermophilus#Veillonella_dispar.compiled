TI  - Diversity of human small intestinal Streptococcus and Veillonella populations.
AB  - Molecular and cultivation approaches were employed to study the phylogenetic richness and temporal dynamics of Streptococcus and Veillonella populations in the small intestine. Microbial profiling of human small intestinal samples collected from four ileostomy subjects at four time points displayed abundant populations of Streptococcus spp. most affiliated with S. salivarius, S. thermophilus, and S. parasanguinis, as well as Veillonella spp. affiliated with V. atypica, V. parvula, V. dispar, and V. rogosae. Relative abundances varied per subject and time of sampling. Streptococcus and Veillonella isolates were cultured using selective media from ileostoma effluent samples collected at two time points from a single subject. The richness of the Streptococcus and Veillonella isolates was assessed at species and strain level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and genetic fingerprinting, respectively. A total of 160 Streptococcus and 37 Veillonella isolates were obtained. Genetic fingerprinting differentiated seven Streptococcus lineages from ileostoma effluent, illustrating the strain richness within this ecosystem. The Veillonella isolates were represented by a single phylotype. Our study demonstrated that the small intestinal Streptococcus populations displayed considerable changes over time at the genetic lineage level because only representative strains of a single Streptococcus lineage could be cultivated from ileostoma effluent at both time points.
TI  - Selection of dairy bacterial strains as probiotics for oral health.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to select bacterial strains with potential properties as oral probiotics, namely for the prevention of dental caries. We examined 23 dairy microorganisms, out of which we identified two Streptococcus thermophilus and two Lactcoccus lactis strains that were able to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads to the same extent as Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ176. Two of them, Strep. thermophilus NCC1561 and Lactoc. lactis ssp. lactis NCC2211, were further successfully incorporated into a biofilm mimicking the dental plaque. Furthermore, they could grow in such a biofilm together with five strains of oral bacterial species, representative of supragingival plaque. In this system, Lactoc. lactis NCC2211 was able to modulate the growth of the oral bacteria, and in particular to diminish the colonization of Streptococcus oralis OMZ607, Veillonella dispar OMZ493, Actinomyces naeslundii OMZ745 and of the cariogenic Strep. sobrinus OMZ176. These findings encourage further research with selected non-pathogenic dairy bacterial strains with the aim to decrease the cariogenic potential of dental plaque.
