TI  == escherichia coli and selected veterinary and zoonotic pathogens isolated from environmental sites in companion animal veterinary hospitals in southern ontario.
AB  == hospital-based infection control in veterinary medicine is emerging and the role  of the environment in hospital-acquired infections (hai) in veterinary hospitals  is largely unknown. this study was initiated to determine the recovery of escherichia coli and selected veterinary and zoonotic pathogens from the environments of 101 community veterinary hospitals. the proportion of hospitals with positive environmental swabs were: e. coli--92%, clostridium difficile--58%, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)--9%, cmy-2 producing e. coli--9%, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius--7%, and salmonella--2%. vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp., canine parvovirus, and feline calicivirus were not isolated. prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in e. coli isolates was low. important potential veterinary and human pathogens were recovered including canadian epidemic strains mrsa-2 and mrsa-5, and c. difficile ribotype 027. there is an environmental reservoir of pathogens in veterinary hospitals; therefore, additional studies are required to characterize risk factors associated with hai in companion animals, including the role of the environment.
