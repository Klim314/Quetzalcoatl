TI  == suicin 3908, a new lantibiotic produced by a strain of streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolated from a healthy carrier pig.
AB  == while streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections in pigs,  it can also be isolated from the tonsils of healthy animals that do not develop infections. we hypothesized that s. suis strains in healthy carrier pigs may have the ability to produce bacteriocins, which may contribute to preventing infections by pathogenic s. suis strains. two of ten s. suis serotype 2 strains isolated from healthy carrier pigs exhibited antibacterial activity against pathogenic s. suis isolates. the bacteriocin produced by s. suis 3908 was purified to homogeneity using a three-step procedure: ammonium sulfate precipitation, cationic exchange hplc, and reversed-phase hplc. the bacteriocin,  called suicin 3908, had a low molecular mass; was resistant to heat, ph, and protease treatments; and possessed membrane permeabilization activity. additive effects were obtained when suicin 3908 was used in combination with penicillin g  or amoxicillin. the amino acid sequence of suicin 3908 suggested that it is lantibiotic-related and made it possible to identify a bacteriocin locus in the genome of s. suis d12. the putative gene cluster involved in suicin production by s. suis 3908 was amplified by pcr, and the sequence analysis revealed the presence of nine open reading frames (orfs), including the structural gene and those required for the modification of amino acids, export, regulation, and immunity. suicin 3908, which is encoded by the suia gene, exhibited approximately 50% identity with bovicin hj50 (streptococcus bovis), thermophilin 1277 (streptococcus thermophilus), and macedovicin (streptococcus macedonicus). given  that s. suis 3908 cannot cause infections in animal models, that it is susceptible to conventional antibiotics, and that it produces a bacteriocin with  antibacterial activity against all pathogenic s. suis strains tested, it could potentially be used to prevent infections and to reduce antibiotic use by the swine industry.

TI  == acquisition through horizontal gene transfer of plasmid psma198 by streptococcus  macedonicus aca-dc 198 points towards the dairy origin of the species.
AB  == background: streptococcus macedonicus is an intriguing streptococcal species whose most frequent source of isolation is fermented foods similarly to streptococcus thermophilus. however, s. macedonicus is closely related to commensal opportunistic pathogens of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex. methodology/principal findings: we analyzed the psma198 plasmid  isolated from the dairy strain streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 in order to provide novel clues about the main ecological niche of this bacterium. psma198 belongs to the narrow host range pci305/pwv02 family found primarily in lactococci and to the best of our knowledge it is the first such plasmid to be reported in streptococci. comparative analysis of the psma198 sequence revealed a high degree of similarity with plasmids isolated from lactococcus lactis strains  deriving from milk or its products. phylogenetic analysis of the psma198 rep showed that the vast majority of closely related proteins derive from lactococcal dairy isolates. additionally, cloning of the psma198 ori in l. lactis revealed a  100% stability of replication over 100 generations. both psma198 and the chromosome of s. macedonicus exhibit a high percentage of potential pseudogenes,  indicating that they have co-evolved under the same gene decay processes. we identified chromosomal regions in s. macedonicus that may have originated from psma198, also supporting a long co-existence of the two replicons. psma198 was also found in divergent biotypes of s. macedonicus and in strains isolated from dispersed geographic locations (e.g. greece and switzerland) showing that psma198's acquisition is not a recent event. conclusions/significance: here we propose that s. macedonicus acquired plasmid psma198 from l. lactis via an ancestral genetic exchange event that took place most probably in milk or dairy products. we provide important evidence that point towards the dairy origin of this species.

TI  == comparative genomics of the dairy isolate streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 against related members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  == background: within the genus streptococcus, only streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. members of the sbsec have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 to the other sbsec genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. results: despite the fact that the sbsec species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus infantarius cj18 and streptococcus pasteurianus atcc 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. in addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of s. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. analysis of the s. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy lactococcus lactis and s. thermophilus as potential donors. in addition, s. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in s. gallolyticus. for example, s. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of s. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy s. infantarius cj18, but also for the blood isolate s. pasteurianus atcc 43144. conclusions: our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of s. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. during this  process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. finally, s. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative sbsec virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == prevalence and comparison of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus in raw and fermented dairy products from east and west africa.
AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus are members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) associated with human infections. sbsec-related endocarditis was  furthermore associated with rural residency in southern europe. sbsec members are increasingly isolated as predominant species from fermented dairy products in europe, asia and africa. african variants of sii displayed dairy adaptations to lactose metabolism paralleling those of streptococcus thermophilus including genome decay. in this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of sii and possibly other sbsec members in dairy products of east and west africa in order to identify their habitat, estimate their importance in dairy fermentation processes and determine geographic areas affected by this potential health risk.  presumptive sbsec members were isolated on semi-selective m17 and sm agar media.  subsequent genotypic identification of isolates was based on rep-pcr fingerprinting and sbsec-specific16s rrna gene pcr assay. detailed identification was achieved through application of novel primers enhancing the binding stringency in partial groes/groel gene amplification and subsequent dna sequencing. the presence of s. thermophilus-like lacs and lacz genes in the sbsec isolates was determined to elucidate the prevalence of this dairy adaptation. isolates (n = 754) were obtained from 72 raw and 95 fermented milk samples from cote d'ivoire and kenya on semi-selective agar media. colonies of sii were not detected from raw milk despite high microbial titers of approximately 10(6)cfu/ml on m17 agar medium. however, after spontaneous milk fermentation sii was genotypically identified in 94.1% of kenyan samples and 60.8% of kenyan isolates. sii prevalence in cote d'ivoire displayed seasonal variations in samples from 32.3% (june) to 40.0% (dec/jan) and isolates from 20.5% (june) to 27.7% (dec/jan) present at titers of 10(6)-10(8)cfu/ml. lacs and lacz genes were detected in all  kenyan and 25.8% (june) to 65.4% (dec/jan) of ivorian sii isolates. regional differences in prevalence of sii and dairy adaptations were observed, but no clear effect of dairy animal, fermentation procedure and climate was revealed. conclusively, the high prevalence of sii in kenya, cote d'ivoire in addition to somalia, sudan and mali strongly indicates a pivotal role of sii in traditional african dairy fermentations potentially paralleling that of typical western dairy species s. thermophilus. putative health risks associated with the consumption of high amounts of live sii and potential different degrees of evolutionary adaptation or ecological colonization require further epidemiologic and genomic investigations, particularly in africa.

TI  == comparative genome analysis of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius cj18, an african fermented camel milk isolate with adaptations to dairy environment.
AB  == background: streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex associated with several human and animal infections. sii is a predominant bacterium in spontaneously fermented  milk products in africa. the genome sequence of sii strain cj18 was compared with that of other streptococcus species to identify dairy adaptations including genome decay such as in streptococcus thermophilus, traits for its competitiveness in spontaneous milk fermentation and to assess potential health risks for consumers. results: the genome of sii cj18 harbors several unique regions in comparison to sii atcc baa-102t, among others an enlarged exo- and capsular polysaccharide operon; streptococcus thermophilus-associated genes; a region containing metabolic and hypothetical genes mostly unique to cj18 and the  dairy isolate streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus; and a second oligopeptide transport operon. dairy adaptations in cj18 are reflected by a high  percentage of pseudogenes (4.9%) representing genome decay which includes the inactivation of the lactose phosphotransferase system (laciiabc) by multiple transposases integration. the presence of lacs and lacz genes is the major dairy  adaptation affecting lactose metabolism pathways also due to the disruption of laciiabc.we constructed mutant strains of lacs, lacz and laciiabc and analyzed the resulting strains of cj18 to confirm the redirection of lactose metabolism via lacs and lacz.natural competence genes are conserved in both sii strains, but cj18 contains a lower number of crispr spacers which indicates a reduced defense  capability against alien dna. no classical streptococcal virulence factors were detected in both sii strains apart from those involved in adhesion which should be considered niche factors. sii-specific virulence factors are not described. several sii-specific regions encoding uncharacterized proteins provide new leads  for virulence analyses and investigation of the unclear association of dairy and  clinical sii with human diseases. conclusions: the genome of the african dairy isolate sii cj18 clearly differs from the human isolate atcc baa-102t. cj18 possesses a high natural competence predisposition likely explaining the enlarged genome. metabolic adaptations to the dairy environment are evident and especially lactose uptake corresponds to s. thermophilus. genome decay is not as advanced as in s. thermophilus (10-19%) possibly due to a shorter history in dairy fermentations.

TI  == macedovicin, the second food-grade lantibiotic produced by streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198.
AB  == streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 was found to produce a second lantibiotic named macedovicin in addition to macedocin. macedovicin was purified to homogeneity and mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of approximately 3.4 kda. partial n-terminal sequence analysis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that macedovicin was identical to bovicin hj50 and thermophilin 1277 produced by streptococcus bovis and streptococcus thermophilus, respectively. macedovicin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, several food spoilage species (e.g. clostridium spp.) and oral streptococci. we determined the complete biosynthetic gene cluster of macedovicin. even though the gene clusters  of macedovicin, thermophilin 1277 and bovicin hj50 were almost identical at the nucleotide level, there were important differences in their predicted genes and proteins. bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics were also found to be encoded by streptococcus suis strains sc84 and d12, enterococcus columbae plch2, clostridium perfringens jgs1721 and several bacillus strains. all these lantibiotics contained a number of conserved amino acids that may be important for their biosynthesis and activity, while phylogenetic analysis supported their dispersion by horizontal gene transfer. in conclusion, the production of multiple bacteriocins may enhance the bio-protective potential of s. macedonicus during food fermentation.

TI  == novel streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius variants harboring lactose metabolism genes homologous to streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) commonly associated with human and animal infections. we elucidated the lactose metabolism of s. infantarius subsp.  infantarius predominant in african fermented milk products. s. infantarius subsp. infantarius isolates (n = 192) were identified in 88% of spontaneously fermented  camel milk suusac samples (n = 24) from kenya and somalia at log(1)(0) 8.2-8.5 cfu ml(-)(1). african s. infantarius isolates excreted stoichiometric amounts of  galactose when grown on lactose, exhibiting a metabolism similar to streptococcus thermophilus and distinct from their type strain. african s. infantarius subsp. infantarius cj18 harbors a regular gal operon with 99.7-100% sequence identity to s. infantarius subsp. infantarius atcc baa-102(t) and a gal-lac operon with 91.7-97.6% sequence identity to s. thermophilus, absent in all sequenced sbsec strains analyzed. the expression and functionality of lacz was demonstrated in a  beta-galactosidase assay. the gal-lac operon was identified in 100% of investigated s. infantarius isolates (n = 46) from suusac samples and confirmed in malian fermented cow milk isolates. the african s. infantarius variant potentially evolved through horizontal gene transfer of an s. thermophilus-homologous lactose pathway. safety assessments are needed to identify any putative health risks of this novel s. infantarius variant.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == gene cluster for biosynthesis of thermophilin 1277--a lantibiotic produced by streptococcus thermophilus sbt1277, and heterologous expression of tepi, a novel  immunity peptide.
AB  == aims: to identify genes cluster for thermophilin 1277 produced by streptococcus thermophilus sbt1277. methods and results: to identify genes for thermophilin 1277 production, the chromosomal dna region surrounding the structural gene, tepa, was sequenced using a primer-walking method. the thermophilin 1277 biosynthesis gene locus (tep) is a 9.9-kb region, which consists of at least ten  open reading frames (orfs) in the following order: tepamtfegkri and orf4. homology analysis showed high similarity to genes involved in bovicin hj50 production by streptococcus bovis hj50. tepi encodes a novel, small, positively charged hydrophobic peptide of 52 amino acids, which contains a putative transmembrane segment. by heterologous expression in lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris mg1363, the tepi-expressing strain exhibited at least 1.3 times higher resistance to thermophilin 1277. conclusions: thermophilin 1277 biosynthesis genes were encoded by a 9.9-kbp region containing at least ten orfs. tepi is a novel immunity peptide, which protected strep. thermophilus sbt1277 against thermophilin 1277 in addition to tepfeg, a putative abc transporter. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report regarding a lantibiotic gene cluster produced by strep. thermophilus strain.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin, thermophilin 1277, produced by streptococcus thermophilus sbt1277.
AB  == aims: to assess the inhibitory activity and the influence of culture condition on the growth and bacteriocin, thermophilin 1277, production by streptococcus thermophilus sbt1277. methods and results: thermophilin 1277, which was produced  by s. thermophilus sbt1277, showed an antimicrobial activity against several lactic acid bacteria and food spoilage bacteria including clostridium butylicum,  c. sprogenes and bacillus cereus. thermophilin 1277 was inactivated by proteinase k. heating treatment did not affect the antimicrobial activity. the partially purified thermophilin 1277 had an apparent molecular mass of 3.7 kda. n-terminal  sequence analysis revealed 15 amino acid residues that correspond with amino acid sequence of the lantibiotics bovicin hj50 produced by streptococcus bovis hj50. the effects of culture condition for the bacteriocin production by s. thermophilus sbt1277 were studied. during the batch fermentation, thermophilin 1277 was produced in m17 broth, but no bacteriocin production occurred in the sucrose-tryptone (st) broth. bacteriocin production was detected in ph controlled st broth at ph values of 5.5-6.5. conclusions: thermophilin 1277 production from  s. thermophilus strain depended on the culture conditions. some characters and n-terminal amino acid sequence of thermophilin 1277 differed from bacteriocins produced by s. thermophilus reported previously. significance and impact of the study: streptococcus thermophilus sbt1277 or its bacteriocin which has a wide inhibitory spectrum has a potential use as a biopreservative in dairy products.

TI  == artisanal and experimental pecorino siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and pcr-dgge analyses.
AB  == traditional artisanal pecorino siciliano (ps) cheeses, and two experimental ps cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. the bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction  fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the 16s rrna gene to that of reference species. the culture-independent fingerprinting technique pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v6 to v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene of samples taken during artisanal ps cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. the dominance of streptococcus bovis and lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal ps was revealed by 16s rrna gene sequencing. comparison of  dgge profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental ps cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional ps cheese.

TI  == 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region sequence variation in streptococcus thermophilus and related dairy streptococci and development of a multiplex its-sscp analysis for their identification.
AB  == the 16s-23s rrna internal transcribed spacer (its) region of several streptococcus thermophilus strains and some related dairy streptococci, s. macedonicus, s. salivarius and s. bovis, was analysed by sequence analysis. all the streptococcus species were easily discriminated on the basis of sequence variations principally located upstream and downstream of the region encompassing the double-stranded processing sites and the trna(ala) gene. comparison between trna(ala) gene sequences highlighted a high level of sequence conservation among  the streptococcus species investigated despite their belonging to separated phylogenetic clusters, i.e. the s. salivarius and s. bovis rrna groups. a low but significant degree of variability was detected among the s. thermophilus strains, allowing the identification of four different its sequences. similarity analysis  of the its sequences showed that the streptococcus species were clustered in two  main branches, one containing s. macedonicus and s. bovis strains, and one containing s. thermophilus and s. salivarius strains. with the aim of developing  a rapid tool for the identification of the dairy streptococci species a multiplex its-sscp analysis of two discrete regions within the its locus was carried out.

TI  == study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base c-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

AB  == two species of dairy streptococci, streptococcus waius and streptococcus macedonicus, were originally characterized by 16s-23s intergenic spacer sequence  analysis, random amplified polymorphic dna fingerprinting, pfge analysis and dna-dna reassociation experiments. all genetic data suggested that s. waius strains belong to the previously described species s. macedonicus. likewise, the  phenotypic characterization showed that strains of s. macedonicus and s. waius were highly related and easily differentiated from the closest phylogenetic neighbour, streptococcus bovis, principally by their failure to produce a blackening reaction in medium containing aesculin. the utilization of maltose and cellobiose by s. macedonicus/s. waius strains allowed their differentiation from  the most studied dairy species, streptococcus thermophilus. on the basis of genetic and phenotypic data s. macedonicus and s. waius species should be considered synonyms and s. macedonicus has the priority.

AB  == a cryptic plasmid designated psbo2 (3582 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. the psbo2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (cop), countertranscribed rnas (ctrnas),  and a replication protein (rep), which were similar to those from pmv158 and pls1, which were isolated from s. agalactiae, and pwvo1, isolated from lactococcus lactis. the putative single-strand origin (sso) of psbo2 was similar  to per341 and pst1, which were isolated from s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmid designated psbe2 was constructed to bind pecm184 vector and the dna fragment containing sso, dso, cop, ctrnas, and rep of psbo2. when psbe2 was introduced into s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. this plasmid, designated psbe2a, was capable of transforming escherichia coli and s. bovis strains 12-u-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, psbe2a is an effective shuttle vector.

TI  == streptococcus waius sp. nov., a thermophilic streptococcus from a biofilm.
AB  == thermophilic streptococci were isolated from biofilms on stainless steel samples  exposed to pasteurized skimmed milk and from dairy products from a dairy manufacturing plant. the phenotypic characters of these isolates were distinct from those of other thermophilic streptococci of dairy origin (streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus bovis). genotypic data [restriction endonuclease analysis, ribotyping, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) profiles, dna-dna hybridization and g + c contents] support the classification of these isolates as a new species. the sequence of the 16s rrna was compared with that of 29 species  of streptococci and shown to be significantly different. the sequence of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region also differed from published sequences of closely related species. a fluorescent in situ hybridization probe prepared to a  specific part of the 16s rrna gene sequence was able to distinguish the unknown isolates from reference isolates of s. thermophilus and s. bovis. it is proposed  that these thermophilic streptococcal isolates from a dairy environment be classified in the genus streptococcus as a new species, streptococcus waius (from waiu, the new zealand maori word for milk). the type strain is 3/1t (= nzrcc 20100t).

AB  == streptococcus thermophilus atcc 19258, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus t-11, and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 were transformed with the alpha-amylase gene (amya) from streptococcus bovis 148 by using a wide host-range vector, and all the transformants secreted the alpha-amylase successfully. since the promoter and the secretion signal of the amya gene were functional in these strains, we constructed a secretion vector using the expression elements of amya. trials to secrete foreign enzymes in yogurt starter  strains were performed using this novel secretion vector.

TI  == cloning, sequence, and expression of the l-(+) lactate dehydrogenase of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the ldh gene encoding the fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent l-(+) lactate dehydrogenase from the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis was cloned and sequenced. a genomic library of s. bovis jb1 dna was constructed in lambda zap ii and screened by use of a heterologous probe derived from the cloned streptococcus mutans ldh gene. several clones were isolated that contained a common 2.9-kb fragment as determined by restriction analysis. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 987-bp open reading frame with extensive homology to streptococcus thermophilus and s. mutans ldh nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. expression  of the cloned s. bovis ldh gene in escherichia coli was confirmed by the ability  to complement the ldh mutation of e. coli fmj39, by using an in-gel activity screen and by enzymatic assay. increased ldh activity was observed in s. bovis jb1 containing the cloned ldh genes on a multicopy plasmid.

TI  == detection and localization of peptidases in lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: pepn1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase pepn, pept1-5 against a tripeptidase pept and pepd1-3 against a dipeptidase pepd. these monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. a number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. pept1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kda protein in lactobacillus delbrueckii,  while pept1 and pept2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of streptococcus thermophilus and clostridium fervidus. of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against pepn, only pepn3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kda protein in escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against pepn3 cross reacted with 80 kda proteins of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii, and str. bovis, but not of esch. coli. of the three monoclonal antibodies against pepd, only pepd1 and pepd2 cross reacted with 40 kda proteins  of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii and str. bovis. all pepn, pepd and pept antibodies  reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of lc. lactis subsp. cremoris wg2. however, lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other lc. lactis subspecies since only pept1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. immunogold labelling of lc. lactis wg2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that pepn, pepd and pept were located intracellularly. the intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.

TI  == the presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein hpr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  == the protein, hpr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts) in bacteria, was purified from streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. the purified preparation gave only one band  when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pi = 4.85). however, electrophoresis in tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by pep in the presence of enzyme i of the pts or by atp with the hpr kinase. homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained  by preparative electrophoresis. each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the  doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. the electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees c for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees c for several months. both hpr proteins catalyzed in vitro the pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with  a preparation of hpr containing both forms of the protein. both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from pep to the other specific pts proteins  known in s salivarius. rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. the presence of the 2 forms of hpr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of s salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. a doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (s mutans, s sobrinus, s sanguis, s thermophilus, s  bovis, s rattus) and also in l lactis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  == bacterial cell walls from str. bovis, str. lactis, str. mutans, str. thermophilus, str. salivarius, and str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. s. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. it was also shown that cell  walls from s. epidermidis, b. megaterium, and m. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. a close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the ppd hypersensitivity. it was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
