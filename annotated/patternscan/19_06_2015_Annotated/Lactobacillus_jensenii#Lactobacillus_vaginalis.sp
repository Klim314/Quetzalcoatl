TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == colonization of the upper genital tract by vaginal bacterial species in nonpregnant women.
AB  == objective: the objective of the study was to evaluate the upper genital tract (ugt) presence of vaginal bacterial species using sensitive molecular methods capable of detecting fastidious bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated bacteria. study design: vaginal swabs were collected prior to hysterectomy. the excised uterus was sterilely opened and swabs collected from the endometrium and upper endocervix. dna was tested in 11 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for 12 bacterial species: lactobacillus iners, l crispatus, l jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, megasphaera spp, prevotella spp, leptotrichia/sneathia, bvab1, bvab2, bvab3, and a broad-range16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene assay. endometrial fluid was tested with luminex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cytokines and defensins and tissue for gene expression of defensins and cathelicidin. results: we enrolled 58 women: mean aged 43 +/- 7 years, mostly white (n = 46; 79%) and bv negative (n = 43; 74%). by species-specific quantitative pcr, 55 (95%) had ugt colonization with at least 1  species (n = 52) or were positive by 16s pcr (n = 3). the most common species were l iners (45% ugt, 61% vagina), prevotella spp (33% ugt, 76% vagina) and l crispatus (33% ugt, 56% vagina). median quantities of bacteria in the ugt were lower than vaginal levels by 2-4 log10 ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene copies per swab. there were no differences in the endometrial inflammatory markers between women with no bacteria, lactobacillus only, or any bv-associated species in the ugt. conclusion: our data suggest that the endometrial cavity is not sterile in most women undergoing hysterectomy and that the presence of low levels of bacteria in the uterus is not associated with significant inflammation.

TI  == characterization of the vaginal microbiota of healthy canadian women through the  menstrual cycle.
AB  == background: the vaginal microbial community plays a vital role in maintaining women's health. understanding the precise bacterial composition is challenging because of the diverse and difficult-to-culture nature of many bacterial constituents, necessitating culture-independent methodology. during a natural menstrual cycle, physiological changes could have an impact on bacterial growth,  colonization, and community structure. the objective of this study was to assess  the stability of the vaginal microbiome of healthy canadian women throughout a menstrual cycle by using cpn60-based microbiota analysis. vaginal swabs from 27 naturally cycling reproductive-age women were collected weekly through a single menstrual cycle. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed to amplify the universal target region of the cpn60 gene and generate amplicons representative of the microbial community. amplicons were pyrosequenced, assembled into operational taxonomic units, and analyzed. samples were also assayed for total 16s rrna gene content and gardnerella vaginalis by quantitative pcr and screened  for the presence of mollicutes by using family and genus-specific pcr. results: overall, the vaginal microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, with little variation in diversity and only modest fluctuations in species richness. microbiomes between women were more different than were those collected consecutively from individual women. clustering of microbial profiles revealed the expected groupings dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus jensenii. interestingly, two additional clusters were dominated by either bifidobacterium breve or a heterogeneous mixture of nonlactobacilli. direct g. vaginalis quantification correlated strongly with its pyrosequencing-read abundance, and mollicutes, including mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma parvum, and ureaplasma urealyticum, were detected in most samples. conclusions: our cpn60-based investigation of the vaginal microbiome demonstrated that in healthy women most vaginal microbiomes remained stable through their menstrual cycle. of interest in these findings was the presence of bifidobacteriales beyond just gardnerella species. bifidobacteriales are frequently underrepresented in 16s rrna gene-based studies, and their detection by cpn60-based investigation suggests that their significance in the vaginal community may be underappreciated.

TI  == comparison of lower genital tract microbiota in hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the us.
AB  == introduction: previous studies have shown that alterations of the bacterial microbiota in the lower female genital tract influence susceptibility to hiv infection and shedding. we assessed geographic differences in types of genital microbiota between hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the united states. methods: genera of lower genital tract bacterial microbiota were identified by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene from 46 us women (36 hiv-infected, 10 hiv-uninfected) and 40 rwandan women (18 hiv-infected, 22 hiv-uninfected) with similar proportions of low (0-3) nugent scores. species of lactobacillus were identified by assembling sequences along with reference sequences into phylogenetic trees. prevalence of genera and lactobacillus species were compared using fisher's exact tests. results: overall the seven most prevalent genera were lactobacillus (74%), prevotella (56%), gardnerella (55%), atopobium (42%), sneathia (37%), megasphaera (30%), and parvimonas (26%), observed at similar prevalences comparing rwandan to us women, except for megasphaera (20% vs. 39%, p = 0.06). additionally, rwandan women had higher frequencies of mycoplasma (23% vs. 7%, p = 0.06) and eggerthella (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.02), and lower frequencies of lachnobacterium (8% vs. 35%, p<0.01) and allisonella (5% vs. 30%, p<0.01), compared with us women. the prevalence of mycoplasma was highest (p<0.05) in hiv-infected rwandan women (39%), compared to  hiv-infected us women (6%), hiv-uninfected rwandan (9%) and us (10%) women. the most prevalent lactobacillus species in both rwandan and us women was l. iners (58% vs. 76%, p = 0.11), followed by l. crispatus (28% vs. 30%, p = 0.82), l. jensenii (20% vs. 24%, p = 0.80), l. gasseri (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.37) and l. vaginalis (20% vs. 7%, p = 0.10). discussion: we found similar prevalence of most major bacterial genera and lactobacillus species in rwandan and us women. further work will be needed to establish whether observed differences differentially impact lower genital tract health or susceptibility to genital infections.

TI  == inhibitory effects of seaweed extracts on the growth of the vaginal bacterium gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == of 44 species of seaweed screened for potential anti-gardnerella vaginalis activity, 27 (61.4%) showed antimicrobial activity by the agar disk-diffusion method. among them, the strongest activities against the pathogen were exhibited  by chlorophyta, with ulva pertusa producing an 11.3-mm zone of inhibition at 5 mg disk(-)(1). the mic values of u. pertusa extracts against both g. vaginalis kctc  5096 and kctc 5097, the main cause of vaginosis, were 312 mug ml(-)(1), while the mic values against both candida albicans kctc 7270 and kctc 7965, the main cause  of candidiasis, were 2.5 mg ml(-)(1). against lactobacillus gasseri kctc 3173 and lactobacillus jensenii kctc 5194, members of the normal vaginal microflora, no inhibitory effect was seen even at 10 mg ml(-)(1). to identify the primary active compounds, a u. pertusa powder was successively fractionated according to polarity, and the main active agents against g. vaginalis kctc 5096 were determined to be nitrogenous compounds (156 mug ml(-)(1) of the mic value). according to these results, it was suggested that extracts of the seaweed u. pertusa are valuable for the development of natural therapeutic agents for treating women with bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with inhibitory activity of female genital tract secretions against escherichia coli.
AB  == objective: female genital tract secretions inhibit e. coli ex vivo and the activity may prevent colonization and provide a biomarker of a healthy microbiome. we hypothesized that high e. coli inhibitory activity would be associated with a lactobacillus crispatus and/or jensenii dominant microbiome and differ from that of women with low inhibitory activity. study design: vaginal swab cell pellets from 20 samples previously obtained in a cross-sectional study  of near-term pregnant and non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-e. coli activity. the v6 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified and sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2000 platform. filtered culture supernatants from lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and gardnerella vaginalis were also assayed for e. coli inhibitory activity. results: sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. there was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8  each). however, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low e. coli inhibitory activity. high activity was associated with a  predominance of l. crispatus (p<0.007) and culture supernatants from l. crispatus exhibited greater e. coli inhibitory activity compared to supernatants obtained from l. iners or g. vaginalis. notably, the e. coli inhibitory activity varied among different strains of l. crispatus. conclusion: microbiome communities with  abundant l. crispatus likely contribute to the e. coli inhibitory activity of vaginal secretions and efforts to promote this environment may prevent e. coli colonization and related sequelae including preterm birth.

TI  == the composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women  is different from that of non-pregnant women.
AB  == background: this study was undertaken to characterize the vaginal microbiota throughout normal human pregnancy using sequence-based techniques. we compared the vaginal microbial composition of non-pregnant patients with a group of pregnant women who delivered at term. results: a retrospective case-control longitudinal study was designed and included non-pregnant women (n = 32) and pregnant women who delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications (n =  22). serial samples of vaginal fluid were collected from both non-pregnant and pregnant patients. a 16s rrna gene sequence-based survey was conducted using pyrosequencing to characterize the structure and stability of the vaginal microbiota. linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to identify the phylotypes whose relative abundance was different between the two study groups. the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women was different from that of non-pregnant women (higher abundance of lactobacillus vaginalis, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii and lower abundance of 22 other phylotypes in pregnant women). bacterial community state type (cst) iv-b or cst iv-a characterized by high relative abundance of species of genus atopobium as well as the presence of prevotella, sneathia, gardnerella, ruminococcaceae, parvimonas, mobiluncus and other taxa previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis were less frequent in normal pregnancy. the stability of the  vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was higher than that of non-pregnant women;  however, during normal pregnancy, bacterial communities shift almost exclusively  from one cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. to another cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. conclusion: we report the first longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota in normal pregnancy. differences in the composition and stability of the microbial community between pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed. lactobacillus spp. were the predominant members of the microbial community in normal pregnancy. these results can serve as the basis to study the  relationship between the vaginal microbiome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == combining a synthetic spermicide with a natural trichomonacide for safe, prophylactic contraception.
AB  == study question: can a specifically acting synthetic spermicide (dse-37) be combined with a natural microbicide (saponins) for safe, prophylactic contraception? summary answer: a 1:1 (w/w) combination of dse-37 and sapindus saponins can target sperm and trichomonas vaginalis precisely without any noticeable off-target effects on somatic cells at effective concentrations. what  is known already: broad-spectrum vaginal agents like nonoxynol-9 (n-9) and cellulose sulfate have failed clinically as microbicides due to non-specific off-target effects, whereas agents that specifically target retroviruses have shown promise in clinical trials. dse-37 and sapindus saponins, respectively, specifically target human sperm and t. vaginalis in vitro. study design, size, duration: a comprehensive study of efficacy and safety was undertaken using in vitro (human cells) and in vivo (rabbit) models. the 1:1 combination of dse-37 and sapindus saponins was based on the in vitro spermicidal and anti-trichomonal  activities of the two components. n-9, the spermicide in clinical use, served as  reference control. free sperm thiols were fluorescently glinted to reveal differences in the targets of the test agents. participants/materials, setting, methods: on/off-target effects were evaluated in vitro against human sperm, t. vaginalis, hela, vk2/e6e7, end1/e6e7 and lactobacillus jensenii, using standard assays of drug susceptibility, cell viability, flow cytometric assessment of cell apoptosis and qpcr for expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine mrnas. the spermicidal effect was also recorded live and free thiols on sperm were fluorescently visualized using a commercial kit. in vivo contraceptive efficacy (pregnancy/fertility rates) and safety (vaginal histopathology and in situ immune-labeling of inflammation markers vcam-1, e-selectin and nfkb) were evaluated in rabbits. main results and the role of chance: a 0.003% drug 'combination' containing 0.0015% each of dse-37 and sapindus saponins in physiological saline irreversibly immobilized 100% human sperm in approximately 30 s and eliminated 100% t. vaginalis in 24 h, without causing any detectable toxicity to human cervical (hela) cells and lactobacilli in 24-48 h, in vitro. n-9 at 0.003% exhibited lower microbicidal activity against trichomonas but failed in spermicidal assays while causing severe toxicity to hela cells and lactobacilli in 12-24 h. the 'combination' of dse-37 and sapindus saponins completely prevented pregnancy in rabbits at a vaginal dose of 20 mg (1% in k-y jelly), while application of 5% 'combination' in k-y jelly for 4 consecutive days caused negligible alterations in epithelial lining of rabbit vagina with only minor changes in levels of inflammation markers. n-9 at a 20 mg vaginal dose prevented pregnancy in 33% animals and a 4-day repeat application of 2% n-9 gel caused severe local toxicity to vaginal epithelium with molecular expression of acute inflammation markers. limitations, reasons for caution: the number of animals used for the in vivo efficacy study was limited by the approval of the animal ethics committee. wider implications of the findings: anti-trichomonal contraceptives with specifically acting synthetic component and clinically-proven safe natural component may define a new concept in empowering women to control their fertility and reproductive health. study funding/competing interest(s): the study was funded by csir-network project 'program' (bsc0101) and partly by the ministry of health and family welfare, government of india (gap0001). the funding agencies did not play any role in this study and none of the authors had any competing interest(s).

TI  == identification and characterisation of vaginal lactobacilli from south african women.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv), which is highly prevalent in the african population, is one of the most common vaginal syndromes affecting women in their  reproductive age placing them at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases including infection by human immunodeficiency virus-1. the vaginal microbiota of  a healthy woman is often dominated by the species belonging to the genus lactobacillus namely l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii and l. iners, which have been extensively studied in european populations, albeit less so in south african women. in this study, we have therefore identified the vaginal lactobacillus species in a group of 40 african women from soweto, a township on the outskirts of johannesburg, south africa. methods: identification was done by  cultivating the lactobacilli on rogosa agar, de man-rogosa-sharpe (mrs) and blood agar plates with 5% horse blood followed by sequencing of the 16s ribosomal dna.  bv was diagnosed on the basis of nugent scores. since some of the previous studies have shown that the lack of vaginal hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) producing lactobacilli is associated with bacterial vaginosis, the lactobacillus isolates were also characterised for their production of h2o2. results: cultivable lactobacillus species were identified in 19 out of 21 women without bv, in three  out of five women with intermediate microbiota and in eight out of 14 women with  bv. we observed that l. crispatus, l. iners, l. jensenii, l. gasseri and l. vaginalis were the predominant species. the presence of l. crispatus was associated with normal vaginal microbiota (p = 0.024). high level of h2o2 producing lactobacilli were more often isolated from women with normal microbiota than from the women with bv, although not to a statistically significant degree (p = 0.064). conclusion: the vaginal lactobacillus species isolated from the cohort of south african women are similar to those identified in european populations. in accordance with the other published studies, l. crispatus is related to a normal vaginal microbiota. hydrogen peroxide production was not significantly associated to the bv status which could be attributed to the limited number of samples or to other antimicrobial factors that might be involved.

TI  == effect of sexual debut on vaginal microbiota in a cohort of young women.
AB  == objective: bacterial vaginosis is uncommon in women who are virgins. we estimated effects of sexual debut on vaginal bacterial colonization. methods: women who were virgins and aged 18-22 years enrolled in a study of human papillomavirus acquisition were followed every 4 months for up to 2 years. vaginal swabs from before and after sexual debut or two independent visits for those remaining virgins were tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, gardnerella vaginalis, and the bacterial vaginosis-associated species atopobium vaginae, megasphaera species, leptotrichia species, sneathia species, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium-1, -2, and -3. results: we evaluated 97 women: 71  who became sexually active and 26 who remained virgins. at first sampling, 22 of  26 (85%) women who remained virgins were colonized with lactobacillus species compared with 22 of 26 (85%) at follow-up (p>.99). g vaginalis was present in 12  of 26 (46%) initially and 11 of 26 (42%) at follow-up (p>.99). among women who became sexually active, colonization with lactobacillus species remained stable:  65 of 71 (92%) compared with 66 of 71 (93%) (p>.99), whereas colonization with g  vaginalis increased (28 of 71 [39%] compared with 40 of 71 [56%]; p=.02). among women who did not initiate sexual activity during the study, two of 26 (8%) had any bacterial vaginosis-associated species detected at both the first and second  visits (p>.99). among women who became sexually active during the study, 15 of 71 (21%) were colonized with bacterial vaginosis-associated species initially compared with 13 of 71 (18%) after sexual debut (p=.77). conclusions: among women who were virgins, vaginal colonization with bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterial species is uncommon and does not change after sexual debut.

TI  == phase i randomized safety study of twice daily dosing of acidform vaginal gel: candidate antimicrobial contraceptive.
AB  == background: acidform gel, an acid-buffering product that inactivates spermatozoa, may be an effective topical non-hormonal contraceptive. this study was designed to evaluate the safety of vaginal dosing and effects of acidform on mucosal immune mediators, antimicrobial properties of genital secretions, and vaginal microbiota. methods: thirty-six sexually abstinent u.s. women were randomized to  apply acidform or hydroxyethylcellulose (hec) placebo gel twice daily for 14 consecutive days. safety was assessed by symptoms and pelvic examination. the impact of gel on mucosal immunity was assessed by quantifying cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial proteins and antimicrobial activity of genital secretions collected by cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) at screening, 2 hours after gel application, and on days 7, 14 and 21. vaginal microbiota was characterized at enrollment and day 14 using species-specific quantitative pcr assays. results: the median vaginal and cervical ph was significantly lower 2 hours after application of acidform and was associated with an increase in the bactericidal activity of cvl against e. coli. however, 65% of women who received acidform had  at least one local adverse event compared with 11% who received placebo (p = 0.002). while there was no increase in inflammatory cytokines or chemokines, cvl  concentrations of lactoferrin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra), an  anti-inflammatory protein, were significantly lower following acidform compared to hec placebo gel application. there were no significant changes in lactobacillus crispatus or lactobacillus jensenii in either group but there was a decrease in gardnerella vaginalis in the acidform group (p = 0.08). conclusions:  acidform gel may augment mucosal defense as evidenced by an increase in bactericidal activity of genital secretions against e. coli and a decrease in gardnerella vaginalis colonization. however, acidform was associated with more irritation than placebo and lower levels of antimicrobial (lactoferrin) and anti-inflammatory (il-1ra) proteins. these findings indicate the need for additional safety studies of this candidate non-hormonal contraceptive. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct00850837.

TI  == association between trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal bacterial community composition among reproductive-age women.
AB  == objectives: some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection by sexually transmitted organisms. prior work demonstrated that the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial communities; 4 dominated by lactobacillus species (l. iners, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (cst) iv) lacking significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of atopobium, prevotella, parvimonas, sneathia, gardnerella, mobiluncus, and other taxa. we sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial composition and trichomonas vaginalis. methods: self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. t. vaginalis screening was performed using pcr targeting the 18s rrna and beta-tubulin genes. vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16s rrna genes. a panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype t. vaginalis. the association between vaginal microbiota and t. vaginalis was evaluated by exact logistic regression. results: t. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). of the 11 t. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as cst-iv, 2 (18%) as communities dominated by l. iners, and 1 (9%) as l. crispatus-dominated (p = 0.05). cst-iv microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of detecting t. vaginalis compared with  women in the l. crispatus-dominated state (or: 8.26, 95% ci: 1.07-372.65). seven  of the 11 t. vaginalis isolates were assigned to 2 genotypes. conclusion: t. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of mycoplasma, parvimonas, sneathia, and other  anaerobes.

TI  == quantification of bacterial species of the vaginal microbiome in different groups of women, using nucleic acid amplification tests.
AB  == background: the vaginal microbiome plays an important role in urogenital health.  quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for the most prevalent vaginal lactobacillus species and bacterial vaginosis species g. vaginalis and a. vaginae exist, but qpcr information regarding variation over time is still very limited. we set up qpcr assays for a selection of seven species and defined the temporal variation over three menstrual cycles in a healthy caucasian population with a normal nugent score. we also explored differences in qpcr data between these healthy women and an 'at risk' clinic population of caucasian, african and asian women with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv), as defined by the nugent score. results: temporal stability of the lactobacillus species counts was high with l. crispatus counts of 108 copies/ml and l. vaginalis counts of 106 copies/ml. we identified 2 types of 'normal flora' and one 'bv type flora' with latent class analysis on the combined data of all women. the first group was particularly common in women with a normal nugent score and was characterized by a high frequency of l. crispatus, l. iners, l. jensenii, and l. vaginalis and a correspondingly low frequency of l. gasseri and a. vaginae. the second group was characterized by the predominance of l. gasseri and l. vaginalis and was found most commonly in healthy caucasian women.  the third group was commonest in women with a high nugent score but was also seen in a subset of african and asian women with a low nugent score and was characterized by the absence of lactobacillus species (except for l. iners) but the presence of g. vaginalis and a. vaginae. conclusions: we have shown that the  quantification of specific bacteria by qpcr contributes to a better description of the non-bv vaginal microbiome, but we also demonstrated that differences in populations such as risk and ethnicity also have to be taken into account. we believe that our selection of indicator organisms represents a feasible strategy  for the assessment of the vaginal microbiome and could be useful for monitoring the microbiome in safety trials of vaginal products.

TI  == characteristics of lactobacillus and gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against gardnerella vaginalis by lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (bv), and to select one of the better lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive g. vaginalis isolates. a total of 24 isolates from women with and without bv were identified as g. vaginalis. a higher frequency (p<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with bv (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). a total of 86 strains of lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (p<0.05) in healthy women  (97.5%) than in women with bv (76.7%). lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. in vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the g. vaginalis strains isolated from women with bv and from healthy women.  lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with bv. concerning the indicator strains, g. vaginalis found in women with bv was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when lactobacillus isolates from women  with bv were used as producer strains. a high vaginal population level of g. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. a tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of g. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an l. johnsonii strain. concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of g. vaginalis-associated bv depends in part on a simultaneous presence of lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a g. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to  this antagonism. the results could also explain why g. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.

TI  == extravaginal reservoirs of vaginal bacteria as risk factors for incident bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) represents shifts in microbiota from lactobacillus spp. to diverse anaerobes. although antibiotics relieve symptoms and temporarily eradicate bv-associated bacteria (bvab), bv usually recurs. we investigated the role of extravaginal bvab reservoirs in recurrence. methods: risks for bv acquisition over the course of 1 year were defined. dna in vaginal,  anal, and oral swab samples from enrollment was subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 16s ribosomal rna genes of gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus crispatus, bvab1, bvab2, bvab3, megasphaera spp., lactobacillus jensenii, and leptotrichia/sneathia spp. a case-control approach analyzed bvab detection at enrollment for case patients (bv acquisition) versus controls (none). results: of 239 women enrolled without bv, 199 were seen in follow-up, and 40 experienced bv; 15 had all samples for analysis. detection of g. vaginalis in oral cavity or anal samples and leptotrichia/sneathia spp. in anal samples was more common at enrollment among case patients, who also had higher concentrations of these bacteria and megasphaera relative to 30 controls at each site. in contrast, l. crispatus was detected more frequently in anal samples among controls. conclusions: women who acquire bv are more likely have previous colonization of extravaginal reservoirs with some bvab, and less likely  to have l. crispatus, suggesting that bvab may be acquired vaginally from extravaginal reservoirs.

AB  == to preliminarily evaluate the applicability of bacterial dna as a marker for the  forensic identification of vaginal fluid, we developed and performed pcr-based detection of 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus spp. dominating the vagina  and of bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria from dna extracted from body fluids and stains. as a result, 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii and atopobium vaginae were specifically detected in vaginal fluid and female urine samples. bacterial genes detected in female urine  might have originated from contaminated vaginal fluid. in addition, those of lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis were also detected in non-vaginal body fluids such as semen. because bacterial genes were successfully amplified in dna samples extracted by using the general procedure for animal tissues without any optional treatments, dna samples prepared for the  identification of vaginal fluid can also be used for personal identification. in  conclusion, 16s ribosomal rna genes of l. crispatus, l. jensenii and a. vaginae could be effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.

TI  == strong correspondence in bacterial loads between the vagina and rectum of pregnant women.
AB  == we sampled the vagina and rectum in 71 pregnant women and bacterial loads of lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. iners, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae were determined by culture and quantitative pcr (qpcr). culture and qpcr results differed substantially with regard to the evaluation of  vaginal and rectal occurrence of the six species tested. the vaginal-rectal prevalence of l. crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. iners, g. vaginalis and a. vaginae as established by culture vs. pcr was 32.3 vs. 91.5%, 32.3 vs. 77.4%,  28.1 vs. 91.5%, 12.6 vs. 68.5%, 12.6 vs. 74.6% and 5.6 vs. 69.0%, respectively. using qpcr, a significant positive correlation was found between vaginal and rectal loads of l. crispatus (p < 0.0001), l. jensenii (p < 0.0001), l. gasseri (p = 0.005), l. iners (p = 0.003) and a. vaginae (p = 0.002). in summary, significant correlations between quantities of vaginal and rectal lactobacilli and of atopobium vaginae were established by means of qpcr, indicating strong correspondence of vaginal and rectal microflora, not only in the occurrence of certain species in both niches, but also of cell densities per bacterial species.

TI  == (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting of lactobacilli isolated from cervix of healthy women.
AB  == a group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (gtg)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the ccm bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by phes gene sequencing. in total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. the (gtg)(5)-pcr method identified lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the lactobacillus crispatus (18), lactobacillus mucosae (one), and lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. l. jensenii strains were distributed over  two fingerprint clusters. the majority of samples was dominated by one (gtg)(5)-pcr type. the rep-pcr fingerprinting using the (gtg)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. this method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.

TI  == correlation between api 50 ch and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the identification of vaginal lactobacilli in isolates.
AB  == identification of lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. a carbohydrate fermentation test (api 50 ch) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. the kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. using the molecular technique, l. crispatus (32.6%), l. jensenii (25%) and l. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. however, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: l. acidophilus (34.8%), l. crispatus (27.2%) and  l. fermentum (13%). although l. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by pcr. agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. although rates of l. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). conclusions: our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (multiplex pcr) for  the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting l. vaginalis and l. iners.

TI  == identification of predominant culturable vaginal lactobacillus species and associated bacteriophages from women with and without vaginal discharge syndrome  in south africa.
AB  == lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus vaginalis were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing as the predominant culturable vaginal lactobacillus species in a  group of south african women, comprising 24, 22, 10, 10 and 9 %, respectively. a  significant effect of vaginal discharge syndrome (vds) and bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the distribution of predominant lactobacillus species was observed. whilst l. crispatus isolates were almost equally distributed between individuals  with and without vds and were not significantly reduced in women with bv versus normal microflora, l. jensenii isolates were significantly reduced in women with  vds (p=0.022) and reduced in women with bv versus normal microflora (p=0.053). unlike l. crispatus, l. jensenii isolates were also significantly reduced in women with bv-associated vds versus women without vds and with normal microflora  (p=0.051). in addition, lysogeny was commonly observed for l. crispatus, with 77  % of isolates yielding phage particles with contractile and non-contractile tails. only 29 % of l. jensenii isolates yielded phage particles, and these were  visible as tailless or podo-like particles.

TI  == temporal variability of human vaginal bacteria and relationship with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: little is known about short-term bacterial fluctuations in the human  vagina. this study used pcr to assess the variability in concentrations of key vaginal bacteria in healthy women and the immediate response to antibiotic treatment in women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). methodology/principal findings: twenty-two women assessed for bv using amsel's criteria were evaluated daily for  7 or 14 days, then at 2, 3 and 4 weeks, using a panel of 11 bacterium-specific quantitative pcr assays. participants with bv were treated with 5 days of intravaginal metronidazole. participants without bv had vaginal biotas dominated  by lactobacilli, whose levels fluctuated with menses. with onset of menstruation, quantities of lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus crispatus decreased and were found to be inversely related to gardnerella vaginalis concentrations (p<0.001). women with bv had a variety of fastidious bacteria whose concentrations dropped below detection thresholds 1-5 days after starting metronidazole. recurrent bv was characterized by initial profound decreases of bv-associated bacteria after treatment followed by subsequent increases at relapse. conclusions/significance: the microbiota of the human vagina can be highly dynamic. healthy women are colonized with lactobacillus species, but levels can change dramatically over a month. marked increases in g. vaginalis were observed during menses. participants with bv have diverse communities of fastidious bacteria that are depleted by vaginal metronidazole therapy. women with recurrent bv initially respond to antibiotic treatment with steep declines in bacterial concentrations, but these bacteria later reemerge, suggesting that antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is not an important factor mediating bv recurrence.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against candida spp.
AB  == urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. the treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. in this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against candida spp. the lab were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, and c. tropicalis, adhesion to caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). all  lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four candida species into different degrees; among them l. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. the highest amount of lactic acid was produced  by l. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by l. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), l. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and l. jensenii (5.4 g/l). all isolates produced h2o2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri,  l. johnsonii, and l. vaginalis. only l. agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii and l.  ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial caco-2 cells. among the isolates evaluated, l agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii, and l. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.

TI  == comparison of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. thus an accurate understanding of the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the etiology of these diseases. this study aimed to compare the characteristics of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) by quantitative culture and pcr methods. main lactobacillus species include l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii and l. iners. methods: a total of 150 women attending gynecology outpatient clinic of beijing friendship hospital, were diagnosed as having bv because three or more of the following criteria were met (standard of amsel's composite criteria): homogeneous discharge, elevated vaginal ph (ph > 4.5), production of amines, and presence of  "clue" cells. those with less than three of the criteria were considered as healthy. simultaneously, smears were made of vaginal fluid and gram stained, then were assessed qualitatively as normal (grade i), intermediate (grade ii), or consistent with bv (grade iii). gardnerella vaginalis were identified by using vitek 2 compact and pcr methods. lactobacillus species were identified by pcr methods. gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli colony counts were determined by  calculating the most number of colonies of each species in the appropriate plates (colonies between 10 and 300), corrected by the dilution of the sample in the plates, and multiplied by 10 (to account for plating 100 microl), in order to get colony forming units per milliliter of vaginal secretion. results: bv was diagnosed in 31% (46/150) patients using the composite criteria, the remainder being regarded as healthy. the majority of patients with bv had a smear assessed  as grade iii (91%, 42/46) and minority of them had a smear assessed as grade ii (9%, 4/46). the majority of healthy women had a smear assessed as grade i (64%, 67/104). smears assessed as grade ii were found (36%, 37/104) among patients diagnosed as healthy, with less than three of the composite criteria. l. crispatus was cultured from 94% of healthy women and 83% of women with bv, with the former colonies count average value of 10(6) and the latter of 10(3). l. gasseri, l. iners, and l. jensenii were cultured from 85%, 68% and 43% of healthy women; and 28%, 89% and 44% of bv women, respectively. conclusions: the quantities of four lactobacillus species except l. jensenii had a significant difference between healthy women and women with bv. our results provide support for the negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri. although l. crispatus were existent both in healthy and bv positive women's vagina, the numbers of l. crispatus were significantly different for the dominant number in healthy women. smears of vaginal fluid and gram stain play an important guiding role in bacteria culture.

TI  == in vitro inhibitory activity of human vaginal lactobacilli against pathogenic bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis in kenyan women.
AB  == lactobacilli have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of many pathogens and have been used as probiotics to treat a broad range of gastrointestinal and/or vaginal disorders. we sought to determine the in vitro inhibitory potential of lactobacilli of vaginal origin to some bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv), to characterize the inhibitory substances produced by these lactobacilli and to assess h2o2 production. vaginal specimens were obtained by swabbing the lateral vaginal walls from 107 women two months following bv treatment. one hundred and fifty eight lactobacillus spp. were isolated in 82 of  the 107 women. lactobacillus jensenii was the predominant strain isolated among these women (29/158; 18.4%). among 158 culture supernatants tested for antibacterial activity against bv-associated bacteria, none inhibited the growth  of bacteroides fragilis while 23% (37/158), 28% (45/158) and 29% (46/158) inhibited the growth of prevotella bivia, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus spp. respectively. the lactobacilli produced supernatants with a ph range between 2.62 and 6.71; the highly acidic (ph 2-3.99) supernatants were more inhibitory to the indicator strains. there was significant reduction in the mean zones of inhibition following chemical and physical treatment of the supernatants (p = 0.0025). acid, bacteriocins and h2o2 demonstrated potential for antagonism of the bacterial pathogens. these substances may augment each other rather that each working independently on the pathogens.

TI  == [prevalence and characterization of vaginal lactobacillus species in women at reproductive age without vulvovaginitis].
AB  == purpose: to identify species of lactobacillus isolated from the vaginal contents  of healthy and asymptomatic women, determining the most prevalent species and characterizing them phenotypically. methods: lactobacillus have been isolated in  selective milieu from samples of the vaginal contents of 135 women without complaints of vaginal secretion, and with negative laboratorial diagnosis of vaginal infection, followed up at an outpatient clinic. after being identified by multiplex pcr, the isolates have been submitted to rnar 16s gene sequencing, when necessary. they have also been evaluated concerning the production of lactic acid, h2o2, bacteriocins and the ability to adhere to epithelial cells. results:  eight-three lactobacillus strains were isolated and identified, l. crispatus (30.1%), l. jensenii (26.5%), l. gasseri (22.9%) e l. vaginalis (8.4%), being the prevalent species. only 20 of those isolates did not present h2o2 production, in  detectable amounts. from the 37 strains selected for the test of adhesion to the  epithelial cells, 12 presented 50 to 69% of adhesion, 10 presented 70% or more, and the remaining, little or no adhesion at all. none of the tested strains produced bacteriocins. conclusions: the lactobacillus species more prevalent in women without vulvovaginitis, isolated in selective culture milieu and identified by molecular methods were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. besides the fact of being more prevalent, these strains also presented better production of h2o2, and reached lower ph values in the culture milieu.

AB  == our objective was to determine the morphotype of the adherent bacteria in liquid-based cytology (lbc) in smears with healthy and disturbed vaginal flora. and to use pcr technology on the same fixed cell sample to establish dna patterns of the 16s rna genes of the bacteria in the sample. thirty samples were randomly  selected from a large group of cervical cell samples suspended in a commercial coagulant fixative "(boonfix)." pcr was used to amplify dna of five bacterial species: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, and mycoplasma hominis. the lbc slides were then analyzed by light microscopy to estimate bacterial adhesion. dna of lactobacilli  was detected in all cell samples. seventeen smears showed colonization with gardnerella vaginalis (range 2.6 x 10(2)-3.0 x 10(5) bacteria/mul boonfix sample). two cases were identified as dysbacteriotic with high dna values for gardnerella vaginalis and low values for lactobacillus crispatus. the sample with the highest concentration for gardnerella vaginalis showed an unequivocal gardnerella infection. this study indicates that the adherence pattern of a disturbed flora in liquid-based cervical samples can be identified unequivocally, and that these samples are suitable for quantitative pcr analysis. this cultivation independent method reveals a strong inverse relationship between gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus crispatus in dysbacteriosis and unequivocal gardnerella infection.

TI  == the human vaginal bacterial biota and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the bacterial biota of the human vagina can have a profound impact on the health  of women and their neonates. changes in the vaginal microbiota have been associated with several adverse health outcomes including premature birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, and acquisition of hiv infection. cultivation-independent molecular methods have provided new insights regarding bacterial diversity in this important niche, particularly in women with the common condition bacterial vaginosis (bv). pcr methods have shown that women with bv have complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include many fastidious species, particularly from the phyla bacteroidetes and actinobacteria. healthy women are mostly colonized with lactobacilli such as lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, and lactobacillus iners, though a variety of other bacteria may be present. the microbiology of bv is heterogeneous. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae coating the vaginal epithelium in some subjects with bv suggests that biofilms may contribute to this condition.

TI  == quantitative determination by real-time pcr of four vaginal lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between l. gasseri and l. iners.
AB  == background: most studies of the vaginal microflora have been based on culture or  on qualitative molecular techniques. here we applied existing real-time pcr formats for lactobacillus crispatus, l. gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis and developed new formats for atopobium vaginae, l. iners and l. jensenii to obtain a quantitative non culture-based determination of these species in 71 vaginal samples from 32 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years.  results: the 71 vaginal microflora samples of these women were categorized, using the ison and hay criteria, as refined by verhelst et al. (2005), as follows: grade ia: 8 samples, grade iab: 10, grade ib: 13, grade i-like: 10, grade ii: 11, grade iii: 12 and grade iv: 7.l. crispatus was found in all but 5 samples and was the most frequent lactobacillus species detected. a significantly lower concentration of l. crispatus was found in grades ii (p < 0.0001) and iii (p = 0.002) compared to grade i. l. jensenii was found in all grades but showed higher concentration in grade iab than in grade ia (p = 0.024). a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were present in high concentrations in grade iii, with log10 median concentrations (log10 mc), respectively of 9.0 and 9.2 cells/ml. twenty (38.5%) of the 52 g. vaginalis positive samples were also positive for a. vaginae. in grade ii we found almost no l. iners (log10 mc: 0/ml) but a high concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 8.7/ml). by contrast, in grade iii we found a high concentration of l. iners (log10 mc: 8.3/ml) and a low concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 0/ml). these results show a negative association between l. gasseri and l. iners (r = -0.397, p = 0.001) and between l. gasseri and a. vaginae (r = -0.408, p < 0.0001). conclusion: in our study we found a clear negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri and between a. vaginae and l. gasseri. our results do not provide support for the generally held proposition that grade ii is an intermediate stage between grades i and iii, because l. gasseri, abundant in grade ii is not predominant in grade iii, whereas l. iners,  abundant in grade iii is present only in low numbers in grade ii samples.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing  degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.

TI  == reversible deficiency of antimicrobial polypeptides in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a common condition associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infections. in contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis has a much weaker association with sexually transmitted diseases. we found that vaginal lavage fluid from women with bacterial vaginosis is deficient in antimicrobial polypeptides and antimicrobial  activity compared to fluid from healthy women or women with vulvovaginal candidiasis. effective treatment normalized the concentrations of antimicrobial polypeptides in both bacterial vaginosis and in vulvovaginal candidiasis, suggesting that the abnormalities were a result of the diseases. unlike in vulvovaginal candidiasis, the neutrophil attractant chemokine interleukin-8 (il-8) was not increased in bacterial vaginosis, accounting for low concentrations of neutrophil-derived defensins in vaginal fluid. in organotypic cultures of human vaginal epithelium containing dendritic cells, treatment with lactobacillus jensenii, a typical vaginal resident, induced the synthesis of il-8 mrna and the epithelial human beta-defensin-2 mrna, but a typical bacterial vaginosis pathogen, gardnerella vaginalis, had no effect. when the two bacteria were combined, gardnerella vaginalis did not interfere with the immunostimulatory effect of lactobacillus jensenii. the loss of normal immunostimulatory flora in bacterial vaginosis is thus associated with a local deficiency of multiple innate immune factors, and this deficiency could predispose individuals to sexually transmitted diseases.

TI  == selection and identification of anaerobic lactobacilli producing inhibitory compounds against vaginal pathogens.
AB  == two strains of lactobacillus crispatus (15l08 and 21l07) and one strain of lactobacillus jensenii (5l08) were selected from amongst 100 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization and the production of h2o2 and/or bacteriocin-like compound. all three strains self-aggregated and adhered to vaginal epithelial cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans. lactobacillus crispatus 15l08 was characterized as a potential h2o2 producer. a high level of bacteriocin-like compound was synthesized by l. jensenii 5l08, with a bactericidal mode of action for g. vaginalis, c. albicans and escherichia coli. however, h2o2-dependent activity alone was not sufficient to inhibit the growth of c. albicans. simultaneous actions of h2o2 and bacteriocin-like compound produced by lactobacilli may be important for antagonizing pathogenic bacteria. these strains of lactobacilli may be excellent candidates for eventual use as probiotics to restore the normal microbial communities in the vaginal ecosystem.

TI  == prebiotic effects of oligosaccharides on selected vaginal lactobacilli and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select endogenous human vaginal lactobacilli strains on the basis of the main probiotic properties observed in the vaginal environment in order to use them for the evaluation of the potential prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides. from vaginal samples of 50 women with a normal flora, 17 lactobacilli strains were first isolated because of their high level of hydrogen peroxide production. then six strains were selected mainly for their ability (i) to adhere to vaginal cells, (ii) to produce compounds in sufficient amount, such as lactic acid, having an inhibitory action on pathogens, and less importantly, (iii) to demonstrate arginine deiminase activity. these six strains  were found to belong to three distinct species: lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii and l. vaginalis. one strain of each species was chosen as a potential vaginal probiotic strain with regard to our criteria. these three strains were then used to evaluate the prebiotic properties of different oligosaccharide series: two fructooligosaccharide series (fos actilight and fos raftilose) and two glucooligosaccharide series varying by their osidic linkages (alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos and alpha-1,2/alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos). the test was based on the ability of the oligosaccharides to promote the growth of the three beneficial strains selected but not of pathogenic microorganisms often encountered in urogenital infections such as candida albicans, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis. oligosaccharide hydrolysis was followed by hplc analysis. this revealed that two oligosaccharide series (fos actilight dp3 and all alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos dp > or = 4) were used only by the lactobacilli strains, the pathogenic microorganisms being unable to metabolise them. the selected lactobacilli and oligosaccharides are good candidates for incorporation  in a formula to prevent vaginal infections.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
AB  == background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2  to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and  a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole  resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on  a more limited number of strains.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to use a novel method that was based on  the application of chaperonin-60 sequencing to describe the vaginal microflora of 16 healthy women. study design: asymptomatic women consented for vaginal swabs to be collected at the time of a clinical pelvic examination. total genomic dna was  isolated from the vaginal swabs. degenerate, universal polymerase chain reaction  primers were used to amplify an approximately 555 base pair region of the universal chaperonin-60 gene, which is found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, from the total genomic dna and libraries of cloned polymerase chain reaction products were constructed. library clones were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups on the basis of similarity to reference sequence data. presence of chlamydophila psittaci sequences in the samples was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. results: sixteen of the 23 women who were enrolled had normal flora by nugent's score of <4 and had adequate polymerase chain reaction product for assessment. vaginal flora libraries were dominated by a variety of sequences with similarity to lactobacillus spp l. crispatus, l. iners, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, and l. buchneri. other sequences that were identified included representatives of gardnerella spp, sequences with similarity to porphyromonas spp and megasphaera spp and sequences identical to c psittaci. conclusion: culture-independent, chaperonin-60 sequence-based molecular methods can lead to the identification of  greater diversity within defined taxa compared with those that are identified by  standard culture-based methods and to the identification of novel organisms that  were not previously associated with vaginal flora.

TI  == susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. fifty-eight lactobacillus isolates were identified as l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii spp. lactis, l. crispatus, l. plantarum, l. cellobiosus, l. jensenii, l. salivarius, l. curvatus, l. brevis and l. oris. the inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 lactobacillus spp. and candida albicans (ajd 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on c. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on lactobacillus isolates. the natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination  for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.

TI  == identification and h(2)o(2) production of vaginal lactobacilli from pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth and relation with outcome.
AB  == lactobacilli, principally the strains that are hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producing, may have a protective effect against vaginal colonization by pathogenic species such as those that cause bacterial vaginosis. previous reports have also suggested that h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli in the vagina may protect pregnant women against ascending infection of the chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cavity. we report the identification and h(2)o(2) production of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal swabs collected at 20 weeks' gestation from a population of pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. we also report the correlation between identification and h(2)o(2) production in relation to the outcomes of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. lactobacilli were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. h(2)o(2) production by isolates was determined by a semiquantitative method. the most commonly isolated species were l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. vaginalis and l. jensenii. amounts of h(2)o(2)  produced by lactobacilli varied widely. the presence of lactobacilli producing high levels of h(2)o(2) in the vagina of this population of pregnant women was associated with a reduced risk of bacterial vaginosis at 20 weeks' gestation and  subsequent chorioamnionitis. l. jensenii and l. vaginalis produced the highest levels of h(2)o(2). we postulate that h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli are able to reduce the incidence of ascending infections of the uterus and the subsequent production of proinflammatory molecules which are important in the pathogenesis of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth.

TI  == antimicrobial components of vaginal fluid.
AB  == objective: we examined the antimicrobial activity and composition of vaginal fluid. study design: vaginal fluid from preweighed tampons was assayed for ph, lactic acid, and antimicrobial polypeptides. the fluid was also fractionated by molecular filtration. antimicrobial activity of whole fluid was determined against representative resident and exogenous microbes, and its fractions were tested against escherichia coli. results: vaginal fluids (5/5 donors) were permissive for lactobacillus crispatus and vaginalis and candida albicans, but not for escherichia coli, streptococcus group b, and lactobacillus jensenii in three of five donors. the antimicrobial activity against e coli was predominantly in a <3-kd fraction and correlated with both low ph and high lactic acid content. compared with a matched ph buffer, lactic acid markedly suppressed the growth of  e coli. concentrated 2- or 5-fold, the protein-rich fraction was active against e coli. conclusion: vaginal fluid exerts selective antimicrobial activity against nonresident bacterial species. the activity is mediated by lactic acid, low ph, and antimicrobial polypeptides.

TI  == genetic diversity of vaginal lactobacilli from women in different countries based on 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli are widely distributed in food and the environment, and some colonize the human body as commensal bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the species of lactobacilli that colonize the vagina and compare them with those found in food and the environment. methods and results: thirty-five lactobacillus strains from women from seven countries were isolated, and sequences from 16s rrna genes were determined and compared with existing data in  genbank. a phylogenetic tree was achieved using the neighbour-joining method based on the analysis of 1465 nucleotides. the results showed that most vaginal isolates were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. some were l. vaginalis, l. fermentum, l. mucosae, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. two isolates from a native american woman displayed distinct branches, indicating novel phylotypes. few vaginal isolates matched food or environmental lactobacillus species. conclusions: most women worldwide were colonized by three common lactobacillus species: l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of vaginal lactobacillus species richness and distribution in women worldwide may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial  replacement therapy.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  == perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. during these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (ph approximately 4). this study was designed to test whether the characteristics of  acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. eight  vaginal lactobacillus isolates from four species-l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. crispatus, and l. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (ph 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (b. andersch, l. forssman, k. lincoln, and p. torstensson, gynecol. obstet. investig. 21:19-25, 1986; l. cohen, br. j. vener. dis. 45:241-246, 1969; j. paavonen, scand. j. infect. dis. suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; c. tevi-benissan, l. belec, m. levy, v. schneider-fauveau, a. si mohamed, m.-c. hallouin, m. matta, and g. gresenguet, clin. diagn. lab. immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). during exponential growth, all of these lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate  observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (w. h. masters and v. e. johnson, human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). during bacterial  vaginosis (bv), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal ph rises to >4.5. this correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. three bv-associated bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia,  and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal ph associated with bv. together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.

TI  == adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant  to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably  were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.
