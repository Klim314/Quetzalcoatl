TI  - Anaerofustis stercorihominis gen. nov., sp. nov., from human feces.
AB  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on an unidentified Gram-positive, strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium isolated from human feces. The organism was catalase-negative, resistant to 20% bile, produced acetic and butyric acids as end products of glucose metabolism, and possessed a G+C content of approximately 70 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the unidentified bacterium was a member of the Clostridium sub-phylum of the Gram-positive bacteria, and formed a loose association with rRNA cluster XV. Sequence divergence values of 12% or greater were observed between the unidentified bacterium and all other recognized species within this and related rRNA clusters. Treeing analysis showed the unknown anaerobe formed a deep line branching near to the base of rRNA cluster XV and phylogenetically represents a hitherto unknown taxon, distinct from Acetobacterium, Eubacterium sensu stricto, Pseudoramibacter and other related organisms. Based on both phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium from feces be classified in a new genus Anaerofustis, as Anaerofustis stercorihominis sp. nov. The type strain of Anaerofustis stercorihominis is ATCC BAA-858(T)=CCUG 47767(T).
