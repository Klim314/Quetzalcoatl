TI  == the predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  == purpose: to detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. material and methods: clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. cultures were made from clinical  materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. results: the following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: streptococcus milleri group (smg) (23.8%) [streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), streptococcus mitis (4.7%), streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), prevotella buccae (4.7%), prevotella intermedia (4.7%), actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), rothia denticariosa (4.7%), gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). conclusions: results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. it was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. although no  specific microorganism was found, streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially smg (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == proteolysis and utilization of albumin by enrichment cultures of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == subgingival dental plaque consists mainly of microorganisms that derive their energy from amino acid fermentation. their nutrient requirements are met by the subgingival proteolytic system, which includes proteases from microorganism and inflammatory cells, and substrate proteins from sulcus exudate, including albumin. to determine the selective effect of individual proteins on microbiota,  we used albumin as the main substrate for growth. eight subgingval plaque samples from untreated periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis were inoculated in peptone yeast medium with bovine albumin (9 g/l). after three subculture steps, cell yields of the enrichment cultures at the medium with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/l albumin were determined. proteolytic activity (u/absorbance at 550 nm) of the enrichment cultures and different isolates derived from the cultures was estimated by the degradation of resorufin-labeled casein. it was observed that the yield of the mixed culture was albumin limited,  and the proteolytic activities of the cultures in albumin broth were higher than  in control (peptone broth). among the isolates from the enrichment cultures, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae and prevotella bivia demonstrated proteolysis. the frequent occurrence of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus anginosus in the albumin cultures is explained by their ability to utilize arginine as an energy source for growth. albumin in the medium was partly degraded by pure cultures but completely consumed in enrichment cultures, indicating synergy of bacterial proteinases. it  is concluded that the subgingival microbiota possesses proteolytic activity and may use albumin as a substrate for their growth. enrichment cultures on albumin may serve as a relatively simple in vitro model to evaluate the effects of proteinase inhibitors.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == beta-lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  == in 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. in addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (dryslide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. based on the non-selective plates, six  of 23 p. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 b. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 f. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. the beta-lactamase positive species prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, prevotella buccalis and actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range  < 0.01-15%). comparison of the dryslide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory  test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). it was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a  common feature. however, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level  enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. the majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found  among species of the prevotella genus.

TI  == bilophila wadsworthiain brain abscess: case report.
AB  == a case of a patient with a 20-year history of chronic otitis media complicated by cholesteatoma and brain abscess is described. a ct scan with contrast material showed three abscess cavities in the right cerebellar hemisphere. a culture from  a specimen of the cholesteatoma yielded a significant amount of growth of bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella oris and a moderate growth of alpha-streptococci and staphylococcus simulans. from the pus of the brain abscess we also isolated numerous bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella oris and some prevotella buccae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. no aerobes were present. the patient underwent a craniotomy and the biggest abscess was removed together with the capsule. the antimicrobial therapy  included penicillin plus metronidazole and later augmentin. the result of the treatment was a complete cure and total recovery of the patient. this is the first documentation of isolation of b. wadsworthia in chronic otitis media and in brain abscess.

TI  == associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  == significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. the prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate  anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella oralis, eubacterium aerofaciens, eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella  buccae and prevotella intermedia. significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella melaninogenica, pstr. micros/prev. melaninogenica (all p < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and pstr. micros/prevotella spp. (p < 0.01); (c) 'wet' canal (57 cases) and prevotella spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.01), peptostreptococcus spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.05). thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between  individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific  bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the wadsworth anaerobic bacteriology clinical research laboratory (los angeles). anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. a total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. the most common isolates were as follows: fusobacterium nucleatum (19); prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were p. oris); bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were b. fragilis); pigmented prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were peptostreptococcus micros); eubacterium species (7); lactobacillus species (8); actinomyces species (7); and  clostridium species (7). nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: f. nucleatum (five cases); b. fragilis (two cases); and prevotella mangus (one case). of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group d nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. the susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of  these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (mics ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/ml vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/ml for beta-lactamase-negative strains).

TI  == peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  == peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. on occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or  to the mediastinum. we describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess  that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, lactobacillus catenaforme, another lactobacillus species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded p. intermedia and p. buccae plus p. anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group f streptococci, and citrobacter diversus. culture of  the retropharyngeal abscess yielded fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. the patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. this case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that  this infection may lead to.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
