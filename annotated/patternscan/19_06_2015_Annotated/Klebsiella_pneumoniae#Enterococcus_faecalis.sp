TI  == antimicrobial impacts of essential oils on food borne-pathogens.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oil (pine oil, eucalyptus, thyme,  sage tea, lavender, orange, laurel, lemon, myrtle, lemon, rosemary and juniper) was tested by a disc diffusion method against food borne pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus). the major components in essential oils were monoterpenes hydrocarbons, alpha-pinene, limonene; monoterpene phenol, carvacrol  and oxygenated monoterpenes, camphor, 1,8-cineole, eucalyptol, linalool and linalyl acetate. although the antimicrobial effect of essential oils varied depending on the chemical composition of the essential oils and specific microorganism tested, majority of the oils exhibited antibacterial activity against one or more strains. the essential oil with the lowest inhibition zones was juniper with the values varied from 1.5 to 6 mm. however, the components of essential oil of thyme and pine oil are highly active against food borne pathogen, generating the largest inhibition zones for both gram negative and positive bacteria (5.25-28.25 mm vs. 12.5-30 mm inhibition zones). these results  indicate the possibility use of the essential oils on food system as antimicrobial agents against food-borne pathogen. the article also offers some promising patents on applications of essential oils on food industry as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == urinary tract infections and antimicrobial sensitivity among diabetic patients at khartoum, sudan.
AB  == background: patients with diabetes mellitus (dm) are more susceptible to urinary  tract infection (uti) than non-diabetics. due to the emergence of multidrug resistant (mdr) uropathogenic strains, the choice of antimicrobial agent is restricted. this study investigated the epidemiology of uti, antimicrobial susceptibility, and resistance patterns of bacterial isolates from adult diabetic patients. methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted at khartoum hospital, sudan during the period of march - september 2013. consecutive patients (men and  women) were approached to participate in the study, irrespective of uti symptoms. socio-demographic and clinical data were obtained from each participant using pre-tested questionnaires. clean-catch, midstream urine samples were collected and cultured for uti diagnosis and antimicrobial susceptibility. symptomatic bacteriuria was defined as a positive urine culture (>/=10(5) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml of a single bacterial species) from patients with symptoms associated with uti; asymptomatic bacteriuria was defined as a positive urine culture from patients without symptoms associated with uti. results: a total of 200 diabetic patients were enrolled, 121 (60.5%) men and 79 (39.5%) women; 193 (96.5%) had type ii dm. the overall prevalence of uti was 39 (19.5%). among the total population, 17.1% and 20.9% had symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria, respectively. according to multivariate logistic regression, none of the investigated factors (age, sex, type of dm and duration) were associated with uti. the predominant isolates were escherichia coli (22, [56.4%]), and klebsiella pneumoniae, [9, (23%)]. eight of 22 e. coli, four of nine k. pneumoniae and one of five enterococcus faecalis isolates originated from symptomatic patients. six, four, three, and two of 22 e. coli isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, respectively. two, two, one and one of nine k. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, cephalexin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. all 22 e. coli isolates were sensitive (100%) to gentamicin and cephalexin. all nine k.  pneumoniae were sensitive to gentamicin (100%) and 88.8% were sensitive to cephalexin. conclusion: in sudan, about one-fifth of diabetic patients have uti.  e. coli is the most frequent isolate followed by k. pneumoniae.

TI  == urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus saprophyticus. high recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. in this review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating  the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of utis. we also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for utis.

TI  == nanostructured sensor based on carbon nanotubes and clavanin a for bacterial detection.
AB  == unusual methods for specific detection of pathogenic bacteria are becoming key points for control and identification of problems related to health and (bio)safety. in this context, this work aims to propose a new approach for the development of nanostructured biosensors based on carbon nanotubes (cnts) and antimicrobial peptides for bacterial detection. firstly, the antimicrobial peptide clavanin a (clava) was chemically immobilized on cnts and surface-immobilized clava was used to detect klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus  faecalis, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis in a direct assay format. we used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique to evaluate the effectiveness and sensitivity of the clava-based biosensors by measuring the modifications in their electrochemical responses before and after incubation in presence of different bacteria concentrations. the biosensor was able to discriminate between bacteria concentrations in the 102-106cfuml-1 range. atomic  force microscopy analysis confirmed the biosensor functionality for bacterial recognition. this new sensor system was capable of differentiating between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, since clava showed different affinities toward the pathogenic bacteria species.

TI  == fluoroquinolone resistance in bacteremic and low risk febrile neutropenic patients with cancer.
AB  == background: the low risk febrile neutropenic patients with multinational association for supportive care in cancer (mascc) score of more than 20 are recommended to be treated with fluoroquinolone-based oral treatment by the national comprehensive cancer network (nccn) guideline. this recommendation relies, at least partially, on the high sensitivity of the blood culture isolates to fluoroquinolone in clinical trials conducted in western countries. whether this also applies in middle or low income countries like china where antibiotic resistance is becoming prevalent recently has not been evaluated. methods: all the positive blood culture results from january 2010 to december 2013 in the 2 large chinese cancer centers were reviewed. the patients were included into the study with the following criteria: febrile neutropenia, solid tumor or lymphoma,  mascc score >20, positive blood cultures within two days of the onset of fever, and detailed treatment history. results: a total of 38 patients were included in  this analysis. two patients had polymicrobial bacteremia (enterococcus faecalis and flavimonas oryzihabitans). other isolates included coagulase-negative staphylococcus, micrococcal species, viridans streptococci, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. the majority of the monomicrobial isolates from these 36 patients was escherichia coli (28 patients, 74%). notably, in contrast to the high sensitivity to fluoroquinolone from blood culture of the low risk patients in previous reports in westen countries, a very high drug resistance was observed: 13 out of 28 escherichia coli isolates (46%) or 14 out of all 38 positive cultures (37%). conclusion: the results warrant further validations in prospective clinical trials in countries where antibiotic resistance is prevalent to ensure appropriate antibiotic administration.

TI  == [analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  == objective: to study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. method: a retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of yuying children's hospital of wenzhou medical university seen from january 1, 2004 to december 31, 2013. the clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. result: among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). in 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were gram-negative bacteria. the five most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%),  coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns, 20 cases, 17.9%), streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%),  staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. escherichia coli was the most common  bacterium, followed by streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, p < 0.05). klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, p < 0.05). streptococcus (most were streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset  meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, p < 0.05). drug sensitivity tests showed that all the gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. staphylococci were  resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of cns isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. no streptococcus and enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. none of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. among the gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. there were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by streptococcus died. conclusion:  escherichia coli, cns and streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. there were increasing numbers of cases with streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == diagnostic and therapeutic utility of transrectal ultrasound in urological office prostatic abscess management: a short report from a single urologic center.
AB  == objectives: prostatic abscess (pa) is an infrequent condition in the modern antibiotic era. the everyday use of transrectal ultrasound (trus) during diagnostic work-up and the widespread recurrence to prostatic biopsies may lead to an increase of pa diagnosis. in this short report we analyze the patients characteristics and the management of seven recent cases of pa diagnosed in our institution. materials and methods: the records of 7 patients admitted to our center for luts associated to septic fever or acute urinary retention, was prospectively collected. suspect of pa was done on digital rectal examination (dre) and confirmed by trus performed after urinary system ultrasound (uus) evaluation. patients were admitted to hospital only in case of septic signs. a sovrapubic (spc) or urethral catheter (uc) was placed depending on symptoms. a trus-guided aspiration of pa was performed with patient in lithotomic position, using a 18 gauge two-part needle, side/end fire needle access. patient was discharged with antibiotic therapy and followed up until complete resolution of the pa and symptoms. results: mean age was 62 years (range 24-82). two patients were diabetics and one was affected by the immunodeficiency acquired syndrome (hiv). in one case, pa was detected after a persistent fever post trus guided prostate biopsy. average prostate volume was 69 ml (range 19-118 ml). dre was able to diagnose pa only in 2 cases (29%), uus evaluation in 1 case (14%). all cases were confirmed by trus as hypo-anechoic areas with or without internal echoes in all patients. mean pa dimension was 3.64 cm (range 1.5-8). spc was placed in 3 cases (43%), uc in 3 patients (43%). only 1 patient refused catheterization. side fire needle aspiration was performed in all cases and in combination with end fire access in case of particular location of abscess cavities. second look was needed in 2 cases (29%). antibiotics were administered  in all cases. the aspirated pus showed a positive culture for escherichia coli (43%), klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%) and enterococcus faecalis (14%). pa resolution time mean was 9 days (range 3-24). conclusions: trus evaluation in case of persistent luts associated with fever or acute urinary retention is determinant in the diagnosis of pa. office or institutional management with trus needle aspiration is a good option in these cases.

TI  == antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
AB  == background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult  patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone  resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.

TI  == in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activity of hyperimmune globulin preparations against multiresistant nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == purpose: we compared different immunoglobulin preparations containing igg (intraglobin/intratect) or a mixture of igg, iga, and igm (pentaglobin) to assess the opsonic and protective efficacy of human immunoglobulin preparations against  multiresistent nosocomial pathogens. materials and methods: clinical isolates of  e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus were tested by opsonophagocytic assay using immunologobulin preparations at dilutions usually obtained in patients. the target antigens of opsonic antibodies were characterized by opsonophagocytic inhibition assays, and the protective efficacy in vivo was tested in a mouse bacteremia model as previously described. results: all strains  were killed to at least 50% by pentaglobin. one p. aeruginosa strain was not efficiently killed by intraglobin (23%) but the other strains were killed by intraglobin to a similar degree compared to pentaglobin. opsonic igg antibodies against e. faecalis were directed against lta, while opsonic antibodies in pentaglobin were primarily directed against other cell wall carbohydrates. in a mouse bacteremia model, pentaglobin was more protective than intratect against staphylococcus aureus, while intratect reduced colony counts better than normal rabbit serum or saline. conclusions: all tested human immunoglobulin preparations contain opsonic and protective antibodies against targets present on multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. enrichment of these preparations with igm increases the protective efficacy against some strains, probably due to antibodies directed against cell wall carbohydrates.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == pyranoside-into-furanoside rearrangement: new reaction in carbohydrate chemistry  and its application in oligosaccharide synthesis.
AB  == great interest in natural furanoside-containing compounds has challenged the development of preparative methods for their synthesis. herein a novel reaction in carbohydrate chemistry, namely a pyranoside-into-furanoside (pif) rearrangement permitting the transformation of selectively o-substituted pyranosides into the corresponding furanosides is reported. the discovered process includes acid-promoted sulfation accompanied by rearrangement of the pyranoside ring into a furanoside ring followed by solvolytic o-desulfation. this process, which has no analogy in organic chemistry, was shown to be a very useful tool for the synthesis of furanoside-containing complex oligosaccharides, which was demonstrated by synthesizing disaccharide derivatives alpha-d-galp-(1-->3)-beta-d-galf-opr, 3-o-s-lactyl-beta-d-galf-(1-->3)-beta-d-glcp-opr, and alpha-l-fucf-(1-->4)-beta-d-glcpa-opr related to polysaccharides from the bacteria klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis and the brown seaweed chordaria flagelliformis.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria grow within candida albicans biofilms and induce biofilm formation in suspension cultures.
AB  == the human microbiome contains diverse microorganisms, which share and compete for the same environmental niches. a major microbial growth form in the human body is the biofilm state, where tightly packed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells must cooperate and/or compete for resources in order to survive. we examined mixed biofilms composed of the major fungal species of the gut microbiome, candida albicans, and each of five prevalent bacterial gastrointestinal inhabitants: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. we observed that biofilms formed by c. albicans provide a hypoxic microenvironment that supports the growth of two anaerobic bacteria, even when cultured in ambient oxic conditions that are normally toxic to the bacteria. we also found that coculture with bacteria in biofilms induces massive gene expression changes in c. albicans, including upregulation of wor1, which encodes a transcription regulator that controls a phenotypic switch in c. albicans, from the "white" cell type to the "opaque" cell type. finally, we observed that in suspension cultures, c. perfringens induces aggregation of c. albicans into "mini-biofilms," which allow c. perfringens cells to survive in a normally toxic environment. this work indicates that bacteria and c. albicans interactions modulate the local chemistry of their environment in multiple ways to create niches favorable to their growth and survival.

TI  == lpxc inhibitors as new antibacterial agents and tools for studying regulation of  lipid a biosynthesis in gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == the problem of multidrug resistance in serious gram-negative bacterial pathogens  has escalated so severely that new cellular targets and pathways need to be exploited to avoid many of the preexisting antibiotic resistance mechanisms that  are rapidly disseminating to new strains. the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of lpxc, the enzyme responsible for the first committed step in the biosynthesis of lipid a, represents a clinically unprecedented strategy to specifically act against gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae. in this report, we describe the microbiological characterization of lpxc-4, a recently disclosed inhibitor of this bacterial target, and demonstrate that its spectrum of activity extends to several of the pathogenic species that are most threatening to human health today. we also show that spontaneous generation of lpxc-4 resistance occurs at frequencies comparable to those seen with marketed antibiotics, and we provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms of resistance utilized by target pathogens. interestingly, these isolates also served as tools to further our understanding of the regulation of lipid a biosynthesis and enabled the discovery that this process occurs very distinctly between p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae. finally, we demonstrate that lpxc-4 is efficacious in vivo against multiple strains in different models of bacterial infection and that the  major first-step resistance mechanisms employed by the intended target organisms  can still be effectively treated with this new inhibitor. importance: new antibiotics are needed for the effective treatment of serious infections caused by gram-negative pathogens, and the responsibility of identifying new drug candidates rests squarely on the shoulders of the infectious disease community. the limited number of validated cellular targets and approaches, along with the increasing amount of antibiotic resistance that is spreading throughout the clinical environment, has prompted us to explore the utility of inhibitors of novel targets and pathways in these resistant organisms, since preexisting target-based resistance should be negligible. lipid a biosynthesis is an essential process for the formation of lipopolysaccharide, which is a critical component of the gram-negative outer membrane. in this report, we describe the in vitro and in vivo characterization of novel inhibitors of lpxc, an enzyme whose activity is required for proper lipid a biosynthesis, and demonstrate that our lead compound has the requisite attributes to warrant further consideration as a  novel antibiotic.

TI  == the influence of urinary ph on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the effects of ph on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including ph. because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (ph 4.5) to alkaline (ph 8) conditions and can be  easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of ph in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. materials and  methods: this in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) over the  range of ph 5-8. standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. one-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (p <.05). results: for 18 of the 24 agents, ph was shown to play a significant role  in overall inhibitory activity. although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed ph-dependent effects  against certain organisms. the fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline ph, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by ph. conclusion: clinicians should consider the urinary ph of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. future clinical investigations examining urinary ph and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

TI  == role of the bacterial vaccine solco-urovac(r) in treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections of bacterial origin.
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) represent a serious medical problem with considerably high rate of morbidity. recurrent episodes of urinary tract infection (ruti) may commonly develop in the way of relapse or reinfection. for patients, ruti is always associated with costs, discomfort and decreased quality  of life. standard treatment of ruti is through antibiotics and usually such treatment is required repeatedly. repeat course of antibiotics leads to increase  of resistance of uropathogenic strains. according to the european association of  urology, "the present state of microbial resistance development is alarming". our post-marketing trial was designed to demonstrate the substantial effect of the bacterial vaccine solco-urovac(r) both with independent administration and in conjunction with standard antibacterial medication within therapy and prevention  of ruti. total of 115 patients (men and non-pregnant women) were enrolled in our  open-label post-marketing trial. each patient had more than one year history of ruti and in the past had already taken appropriate course of standard therapy. the trial group included 50 patients: 32 men, 18 women (average age +/- 32.5). 32 patients (men) of the trial group received vaccination with solco-urovac(r) together with the standard antibacterial medication. according to bacteriologic tests, in 62% cases infection was caused by escherichia coli, and in 38% cases by morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis. 18 patients within the trial group were women with no recurrence episode at the start and during the trial period. each woman was involved as the  intercourse partner of the respective man within the trial group. the women received only vaccination with solco-urovac(r). 65 patients of the control group  had more than one year history of ruti and had been treated earlier, too. patients of the control group received appropriate antibacterial medication without solco-urovac(r). after therapy and follow-up examination, results in the  both groups were classified, also in consideration of the pathogen-specified subgroups, and then summarized and compared respectively. during the follow-up period no case of ruti was noticed in women. in total, analysis of the medical records of 50 patients of the trial group demonstrated no case of ruti in 46 patients during the follow-up period. altogether, the rate of improvement of symptoms was as follows: the trial group - 92%, the control group - 74%. through  comparison with the past medical histories of patients, the higher rate of improvement and longer absence of ruti episodes after treatment were certainly associated with the effect of solco-urovac(r). the results of our post-marketing  trial allow recommending solco-urovac(r) for appropriate reference within the georgian national guideline on urologic infections.

TI  == prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and its antibacterial susceptibility pattern among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic at kanpur, india.
AB  == background: symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria (asb) is common in pregnant  women. pregnancy enhances the progression from asb to symptomatic bacteriuria, which if left untreated, could lead to acute pyelonephritis and other adverse outcomes such as prematurity, postpartum, hypertensive disease, anaemia, utis and higher foetal mortality rates. aim: to identify the prevalence of asb, the most common causative microorganisms and the antibacterial susceptibilities of the isolated microorganisms at a tertiary care centre at kanpur, india. materials and methods: a total number of 300 asymptomatic pregnant women were screened for asb  by urine culture by using a semi quantitative culture method. results: in this study, significant bacteriuria was found in only 22 cases (7.3%). growth of contaminants was seen in 40 cases (13.3%). among cases which showed positive cultures, 48.9% were primigravidae and 51.1% were multigravidae. highest incidence was reported in age group of 21-30 years. the predominant organisms which were isolated were escherichia coli, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis. escherichia coli, the most common isolate, was found to be only 61% and 70% sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanate, respectively. sensitivity to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin was 95%, and sensitivity to amikacin was 99%. hundred percent sensitivity was found for the broad spectrum pencillins, imipenem, and meropenem. klebsiella pneumoniae, the second most frequent organism which was grown on culture, was only 11% sensitive to ampicillin, while sensitivity to amoxicillin + clavulanate and cefuroxime was 86%. 100% sensitivity was found for cefepime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and meropenem. conclusion: routine urine culture test should be carried out for all antenatal women, to detect asymptomatic bacteriuria, and every positive case should be treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy, to prevent any obstetric complication which is associated with pregnancy.

TI  == bacteriology and drug susceptibility analysis of pus from patients with severe intra-abdominal infection induced by abdominal trauma.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to retrospectively analyze the bacteriology and  drug susceptibility of pus flora from abdominal trauma patients with severe intra-abdominal infection (siai). a total of 41 patients with siai induced by abdominal trauma were enrolled in the study, from which 123 abdominal pus samples were obtained. the results from laboratory microbiology and drug sensitivity were subjected to susceptibility analysis using whonet software. a total of 297 strains were isolated in which gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 53.5 (159/297), 44.1 (131/297) and 0.7% (2/297), respectively. anaerobic bacteria accounted for 1.7%. the five predominant bacteria were escherichia coli (e. coli), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae), enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa). e. coli was highly susceptible to cefoperazone (91%)  and imipenem (98%), while gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%). s. aureus was 100% susceptible to vancomycin and k. pneumoniae was highly susceptible to imipenem (100%) and amikacin (79%). p. aeruginosa was the most susceptible to ciprofloxacin (90%). gram-negative bacterial infection was present in the majority of cases of siai. however, a large number of patients were infected by gram-positive bacteria, particularly s. aureus that exhibited significant resistance to penicillin (100%), oxacillin (100%) and a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic cefotaxime (95%). amongst the pathogenic bacteria that cause siai, both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria account for a high proportion, so high-level and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initially used.

TI  == influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == frequency and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of urinary pathogens in male outpatients in argentina.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of uropathogens is important for determining the best treatment option. this study aimed to determine the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns  of bacterial strains isolated from adult male outpatients. methodology: between november 2012 and april 2013, 3,105 community urine samples were analyzed from adult male patients who attended the laboratorio hidalgo, buenos aires, argentina. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the kirby-bauer  disc diffusion method. isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporin were  tested for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production using the double-disk synergy test. results: of the 3,105 urine samples analyzed, 791 (25.5%) had significant bacteriuria. the frequency of positive urine cultures increased significantly with patient age. escherichia coli was isolated most frequently (47.3%), followed by enterococcus faecalis (13.6%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (11.9%). gram-negative organisms represented 78.8% of urinary pathogens. the highest activities against gram-negative bacteria were found with  imipenem (99.0%), amikacin (98.1%), ertapenem (94.2%), fosfomycin (90.7%), and piperacillin-tazobactam (90.1%). the frequencies of esbls among e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis were 15.2 %, 22.3%, and 8%, respectively. fosfomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and nitrofurantoin were most effective against gram-positive organisms. conclusions: fosfomycin may be an excellent option for cystitis treatment in patients without risk factors, whereas piperacillin-tazobactam is preferred for the treatment of parenchymatous utis, complicated utis, and utis associated with risk factors. to ensure the optimal selection of antibiotics, physicians should have access to up-to-date information about the local prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == paenibacterin, a novel broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic, neutralises endotoxins and promotes survival in a murine model of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis.
AB  == paenibacterin, produced by paenibacillus thiaminolyticus osy-se, is active both against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. paenibacterin showed relatively low cytotoxicity against a human kidney cell line (atcc crl-2190), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50)>/=109mug/ml. the cationic paenibacterin molecule binds to the negatively charged gram-negative endotoxins in vitro, suggesting that paenibacterin can neutralise lipopolysaccharides. in a murine septic shock model, two 500mug doses of paenibacterin significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with a lethal level of p. aeruginosa. considering that paenibacterin is effective against many strains of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, this study suggests that  this antimicrobial agent is a promising candidate as a new drug.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of antibiotic beads in treating abdominal vascular graft infections.
AB  == objective: abdominal aortic vascular graft infection often involves several different organisms. antibiotic polymethyl methacrylate (pmma) beads may be effective in controlling infection after debridement, but bacterial species identification and antibiotic susceptibility are often not available at the time  of operation, generating a need for a broad-spectrum drug combination for empirical use. we sought to determine an effective antibiotic in pmma beads for use in abdominal vascular graft infection. methods: pmma beads were impregnated with combinations of antibiotics, consisting of daptomycin, tobramycin, and meropenem. antibiotics were selected on the basis of activity spectrum and heat stability. beads were placed on separate agar plates with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. antibiotic inhibition was recorded by use of a modified agar-based disk-diffusion method. results: daptomycin alone  was not active against k. pneumoniae (average = 0 mm). tobramycin alone was not active against vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, k. pneumoniae, or methicillin-resistant s. aureus. tobramycin and daptomycin in combination had moderate broad-spectrum activity with 8- to 14-mm mean inhibition halos. meropenem showed strong activity against all tested organisms with >15-mm mean inhibition halos. the addition of daptomycin to meropenem provided improved coverage of gram-positive organisms. the presence of tobramycin reduced the efficacy of meropenem. conclusions: antibiotic pmma beads containing 10% meropenem with 2.5% daptomycin had excellent in vitro activity against typical bacterial species associated with abdominal vascular graft infections. the addition of antibiotic beads may be a useful adjunct in managing such cases. further studies are required to determine efficacy in clinical practice.

TI  == toxicity of magnetic chitosan micro and nanoparticles as carriers for biologically active substances.
AB  == nanoparticles of inorganic magnetic core surrounded by layers of functional coatings are potential representatives of nanostructures for immobilization of bio-substances. magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) are often bound in aggregates due to a strong magnetic dipole, which has a lot of advantages, such as large surface area for binding biologically active substances. chitosan is a polysaccharide polymer that is non-toxic, hydrophilic, biocompatible and has hydroxy and amino groups in its structure. because of these chemical and biological properties it is a desirable bio-product for immobilization of enzymes and for binding of other biologically active substances. magnetic micro and nanoparticles were synthesized with chitosan by three different methods; microemulsion process, suspension cross-linking technique and covalent binding of chitosan. toxic effect of the prepared magnetic particles was determined as well and was examined on five different bacterial cultures; escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae. at concentrations of 10-30 mg of magnetic particles per 0.5 mcfarland standard solution of e. coli and per 400 cfu of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis in k. pneumonia, no inhibition on the chosen bacterial cultures was detected.

TI  == evaluation of epidemiological cut-off values indicates that biocide resistant subpopulations are uncommon in natural isolates of clinically-relevant microorganisms.
AB  == to date there are no clear criteria to determine whether a microbe is susceptible to biocides or not. as a starting point for distinguishing between wild-type and  resistant organisms, we set out to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) distributions for four common  biocides; triclosan, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite for 3319 clinical isolates, with a particular focus on staphylococcus aureus (n = 1635) and salmonella spp. (n = 901) but also including escherichia coli (n = 368), candida albicans (n = 200), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 60), enterobacter spp. (n = 54), enterococcus faecium (n = 53), and enterococcus faecalis (n = 56). from these data epidemiological cut-off values (ecoffs) are proposed. as would be expected, mbcs were higher than mics for all biocides. in most cases both values  followed a normal distribution. bimodal distributions, indicating the existence of biocide resistant subpopulations were observed for enterobacter chlorhexidine  susceptibility (both mics and mbcs) and the susceptibility to triclosan of enterobacter (mbc), e. coli (mbc and mic) and s. aureus (mbc and mic). there is a concern on the potential selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides. our results indicate however that resistance to biocides and, hence any potential association with antibiotic resistance, is uncommon in natural populations of clinically relevant microorganisms.

TI  == comparison of bacteria isolated from emergency department patients versus hospitalized patients.
AB  == purpose: the frequencies and corresponding susceptibilities of bacteria isolated  from patients in the emergency department (ed) were compared with those from hospitalized patients. methods: a microbiology laboratory report of all positive  bacterial cultures obtained in the ed, regardless of the source (e.g., blood, urine, sputum), was obtained. in the case of duplicate cultures, only the first isolate cultured from a single patient was included. colonization-site cultures (e.g., nasal swabs) and culture reports identified by the laboratory as contaminant organisms were excluded from the evaluation. antimicrobial susceptibility results were then compiled into a standardized ed-specific antibiogram. antimicrobial susceptibilities for each pathogen in the ed antibiogram were compared with those in the hospitalwide antibiogram. if there was a difference of >/=5% between the susceptibility of a single antimicrobial agent, chi-square tests were conducted, and unadjusted odds ratios were calculated. pathogens with fewer than 30 isolates were excluded from the susceptibility comparison. results: a total of 3140 cultures were evaluated (1417 from the ed, 1723 from the hospital). the frequencies of pathogens isolated in the ed and hospitalwide were similar, with the exception of escherichia coli, which were more commonly isolated in ed patients, and enterococcus species and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were more common in hospitalized patients. significant differences in susceptibility profiles were identified for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, enterococcus faecalis,  e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa. conclusion: significant differences in the frequencies of bacteria isolated and corresponding susceptibilities were found in cultures obtained in ed patients compared with those obtained in hospitalized patients.

TI  == the need for vigilance: false-negative screening for adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency caused by deribosylation of urinary biomarkers.
AB  == objectives: adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (dadsl) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder. biochemical diagnosis of the disease is based on the determination of enormously elevated urinary levels of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (saica-riboside) and succinyladenosine (sado). we report a case of false negative screening for dadsl caused by deribosylation of the urinary biomarkers saica-riboside and sado. design and methods: a thin-layer chromatography (tlc) method with pauly reagent detection of saica-riboside was used as a screening method. high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (hplc-dad) and lc-ms/ms methods were used for the identification and quantitative determination of saica-riboside, sado, succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide (saica) and succinyladenine (sa). results: following a negative tlc screening in a known case of dadsl, we analyzed urine using hplc-dad. the concentration of saica-riboside was 2.7mmol/mol creatinine (below the tlc detection limit), and we detected the two abnormal metabolites identified by lc-ms/ms as saica and sa. we showed that saica and sa were produced by deribosylation of saica-riboside and sado in the patient's urine. studies performed by monitoring the production of saica and sa after the addition of saica-riboside and sado to the patient's urine and to urine samples from patients with urinary tract infections suggested that deribosylation is facilitated by bacterial enzymes. conclusions: screening methods for the diagnosis of dadsl may  be falsely negative due to bacteria-mediated deribosylation of saica-riboside and sado. hplc-dad or lc-ms/ms analyses allowing for simultaneous detection of saica-riboside, sado and their deribosylation products saica and sa should be preferentially used for the diagnosis of dadsl in urine.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and sar study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
AB  == a series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. they were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida krusei, and candida albicans. in this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan  spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface  active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). then, we present a sar study for staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the dominance-based rough set approach (drsa), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. the sar study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial  activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.

TI  == emergence of enterococcus species in the infectious microorganisms cultured from  patients with endophthalmitis in south korea.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the microorganisms in culture-proven endophthalmitis and  their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents commonly used in south korea. methods: medical records of consecutive patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at eight institutions between 1 january 2004 and 31 july 31 2010  were reviewed. four categories of endophthalmitis were studied: postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and unspecified. outcome measures were culture-proven  infectious organisms, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and final visual acuity in  the patients. results: a total of 93 microorganisms were identified from 103 patients during the study period. the positive culture rate was 59.2 % (103/174). the most common organisms identified were enterococcus faecalis (in 20.8 % of patients, 20/96), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.8 %, 18/96), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (10.4 %, 10/96), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3 %,  6/96), and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3 %, 6/96). two cases of enterococcus faecium (2.1 %) were recognized. overall, 70 of 96 (73.0 %) isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 22 (23.0 %) were gram-negative bacteria, and 4 (4.2 %) were fungi. the  most common organisms resulting in reduced light perception were e. faecalis and  k. pneumoniae. conclusions: the emergence of e. faecalis in endophthalmitis is mainly caused by the high incidence of e. faecalis in postoperative endophthalmitis. this increase also impacts the final visual acuity of the patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants from the cerrado of the centralwestern region of brazil.
AB  == ethanol extracts from six selected species from the cerrado of the central-western region of brazil, which are used in traditional medicine for the  treatment of infectious diseases and other medical conditions, namely erythroxylum suberosum st. hil. (erythroxylaceae), hyptis crenata pohl. ex benth. (lamiaceae), roupala brasiliensis klotz. (proteaceae), simarouba versicolor st. hil. (simaroubaceae), guazuma ulmifolia lam. (sterculiaceae) and protium heptaphyllum (aubl.) march. (burseraceae), as well as fractions resulting from partition of these crude extracts, were screened in vitro for their antifungal and antibacterial properties. the antimicrobial activities were assessed by the broth microdilution assay against six control fungal strains, candida albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, c. parapsilosis, c. tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans, and five control gram-positive and negative bacterial strains, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. toxicity of the extracts and fractions against artemia salina was also evaluated in this work. all plants investigated showed antimicrobial properties against at least one microorganism and two species were also significantly toxic to brine shrimp larvae. the results tend to support the traditional use of these plants for the treatment of respiratory and  gastrointestinal disorders and/or skin diseases, opening the possibility of finding new antimicrobial agents from these natural sources. among the species investigated, hyptis crenata, erythroxylum suberosum and roupala brasiliensis were considered the most promising candidates for developing of future bioactivity-guided phytochemical investigations.

TI  == correlations between income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study is to investigate if correlations exist between income inequality and antimicrobial resistance. this study's hypothesis is that income inequality at the national level is positively correlated with antimicrobial resistance within developed countries. data collection and analysis: income inequality data were obtained from the standardized world income inequality database. antimicrobial resistance data were obtained from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network and outpatient antimicrobial consumption data, measured by defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day, from the european surveillance of antimicrobial consumption  group. spearman's correlation coefficient (r) defined strengths of correlations of: > 0.8 as strong, > 0.5 as moderate and > 0.2 as weak. confidence intervals and p values were defined for all r values. correlations were calculated for the  time period 2003-10, for 15 european countries. results: income inequality and antimicrobial resistance correlations which were moderate or strong, with 95% confidence intervals > 0, included the following. enterococcus faecalis resistance to aminopenicillins, vancomycin and high level gentamicin was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.54 for all three antimicrobials). escherichia coli resistance to aminoglycosides, aminopenicillins, third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones was moderately-strongly associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.7 for all four antimicrobials). klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.5 for all three antimicrobials). staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistance and income inequality were strongly associated (r=0.87). conclusion: as income inequality increases in european countries so do  the rates of antimicrobial resistance for bacteria including e. faecalis, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus. further studies are needed to confirm these findings outside europe and investigate the processes that could causally link income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanocluster-based affinity mass spectrometry for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == rationale: bacterial infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to irreversible damage to patients if proper treatment is not provided in time. additionally, the emerging threat from antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes medical treatment even more difficult. thus, rapid identification of infected bacterial strains is essential to assist diagnostics and medical treatment. methods: lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases that can bind with peptidoglycans on bacterial cell walls. in this work, we demonstrated that lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (lysozyme-auncs) with red photoluminescence can be used as affinity probes to concentrate pathogenic bacteria. after bacteria had been probed by the lysozyme-auncs in a sample solution, the lysozyme-aunc-bacteria conjugates were readily spun down at a low centrifugation speed. the red emission from the auncs on the conjugates could be  visualized with the naked eye under illumination of ultraviolet light. the bacteria in the conjugates can be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (maldi-ms) combined with principal component analysis (pca). results: we demonstrated that pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) can be readily concentrated by the lysozyme-auncs and distinguished by the results combining maldi-ms and pca. additionally, the possibility of using the current approach to  differentiate e. faecalis from vre was also demonstrated. the lowest detection concentration for e. coli using the current approach is ~10(6) cells/ml. conclusions: the results indicated that the lysozyme-auncs are effective affinity probes for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. by combining the results from maldi-ms and pca, different bacteria can be easily distinguished. the current approach can be potentially used to assist the identification of bacteria from biological fluids.

TI  == one-day point prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in a nationwide sample of 62 german hospitals in 2012 and comparison with the results of the one-day point prevalence of 2010.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. to combat multidrug resistant organisms (mrdos) networks of care providers have been established in all states in germany. the hicare-network, a project to combat mrdos, founded by the federal ministry of education and research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, german-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the german society of hospital hygiene. the aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation  of the situation in 2012. method: the survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in may 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. as in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. based  on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (ha), community-acquired (ca) and lifestock-associated (la) mrsa), vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa/grsa), vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis resp. enterococcus faecium (vr-e. faecalis resp.  vr-e. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (esbl) e. coli (esbl-ec) and klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp), multiresistant acinetobacter spp.  (mab), multiresistant pseudomonas spp. (mrp), carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cre) as well as clostridium difficile (cd) infections and severe infections requiring icu-treatment were included in the survey along with  additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. results: out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). the most frequently reported organisms were mrsa 1.53% [ci95: 1.32-1.75], followed by cdad 1.30% [ci95: 1.11-1.50], esbl-ec 0.97% [ci95: 0.80-1.14], and esbl-kp 0.27% [ci95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. prevalence of mrdos depended on the  level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical  wards compared to surgical wards. all tertiary care providers employed their own  infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. discussion: with more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness  of the problem of antibacterial resistance in germany. the prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. this statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == this study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (utis). urine samples from patients with utis (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. the urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. bacterial species were identified by a combination of  bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the bact-ist microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. the most common seven species of bacteria in the study included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection"  method using capillary electrophoresis (ce). each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. the mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (r(2)=0.99). the effect of urine composition on ce results was also investigated. the results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (wbcs) and red blood cells (rbcs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. the results demonstrated that the bacteria in  urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using ce. the "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from utis.

TI  == volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  == ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (vocs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. the aim of this review is to provide an overview of vocs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. such vocs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. a systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. all six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. since humans do not produce these vocs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. the following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for escherichia coli. notably, several factors that may effect voc production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. in conclusion, vocs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.

TI  == etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. in majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. this study was designed to find out the etiological agents of uti and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. this study was conducted in  kathmandu model hospital, kathmandu, nepal from april to october, 2009. midstream urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of uti were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth.  antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by modified kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. data were analyzed using spss software window  version 16. the overall prevalence of uti was found to be 18.89%. the most frequent causative organisms isolated were escherichia coli (82.30%), enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), citrobacter freundii (3.60%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), coagulase negative staphylococci (2.40%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), proteus mirabilis (0.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). nitrofurantoin and amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. e. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of uti and nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.

AB  == reuse of graywater (gw) for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. one major impediment for reuse of gw is the possible presence of pathogenic microorganisms. the presence and abundance of six pathogens and indicators were investigated in three gw recirculating vertical flow constructed wetland treatment systems and their respective irrigated yard soils. the treated gw and soils were monitored once every two months for six months using real-time quantitative pcr. as a control, samples from four soils irrigated with fresh water (fw) were similarly analyzed for pathogens and indicators. comparable types of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and shigella spp., were found in the treated gw, their corresponding irrigated soils and the fw-irrigated soils. moreover, the abundance of these bacteria in the gw- and fw-irrigated soils was of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that the source of the pathogens cannot be established. our results suggest that gw irrigation has no effect on the diversity and abundance of the tested pathogens and indicators in yard soils.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of bacterial pathogens from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis conducted by the japanese surveillance committee during 2009 and 2010: antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli and staphylococcus saprophyticus.
AB  == the japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of uropathogens responsible for female acute uncomplicated cystitis at 43 hospitals throughout japan from april 2009 to  november 2010. in this study, the causative bacteria (escherichia coli and staphylococcus saprophyticus) and their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents were investigated by isolation and culturing of bacteria from urine samples. in total, 387 strains were isolated from 461 patients, including e. coli (n = 301, 77.8 %), s. saprophyticus (n = 20, 5.2 %), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 13, 3.4 %), and enterococcus faecalis (n = 11, 2.8 %). s. saprophyticus was significantly more common in premenopausal women (p = 0.00095). the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 19 antibacterial agents used for these strains were  determined according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute manual. at least 87 % of e. coli isolates showed susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, and 100 % of s. saprophyticus isolates showed susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. the proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli strains and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli strains were 13.3 % and 4.7 %, respectively. it is important to confirm the susceptibility of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empiric antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors. however, the number of isolates of fluoroquinolone-resistant or esbl-producing strains in gram-negative  bacilli may be increasing in patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in japan. therefore, these data present important information for the proper treatment of utis and will serve as a useful reference for future surveillance studies.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == transplantation-associated long-term immunosuppression promotes oral colonization by potentially opportunistic pathogens without impacting other members of the salivary bacteriome.
AB  == solid-organ transplant recipients rely on pharmacological immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection. the effect of such chronic immunosuppression on the  microflora at mucosal surfaces is not known. we evaluated the salivary bacterial  microbiome of 20 transplant recipients and 19 nonimmunosuppressed controls via 454 pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons. alpha-diversity and global community structure did not differ between transplant and control subjects. however, principal coordinate analysis showed differences in community membership. taxa more prevalent in transplant subjects included operational taxonomic units (otus) of potentially opportunistic gammaproteobacteria such as klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas fluorescens, acinetobacter species, vibrio species, enterobacteriaceae species, and the genera acinetobacter and klebsiella. transplant subjects also had increased proportions of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, enterobacteriaceae species, and enterococcus faecalis, among other otus, while genera with increased proportions included klebsiella, acinetobacter, staphylococcus, and enterococcus. furthermore, in transplant subjects, the dose of the immunosuppressant prednisone positively correlated with bacterial richness, while prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil doses positively correlated with the prevalence and proportions of transplant-associated taxa. correlation network analysis of otu relative abundance revealed a cluster containing potentially opportunistic pathogens as transplant associated. this cluster positively correlated with serum levels of c-reactive protein, suggesting a link between the resident flora at mucosal compartments and systemic inflammation. network connectivity analysis revealed opportunistic pathogens as highly connected to each other and to common oral commensals, pointing to bacterial interactions that may influence colonization. this work demonstrates that immunosuppression aimed at limiting t-cell-mediated responses creates a more permissive oral environment for potentially opportunistic pathogens without affecting other members of the salivary bacteriome.

TI  == american journal of gastroenterology lecture: intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (fmt) in treatment of c. difficile infection.
AB  == the vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. moreover, vital interactions of  the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. a perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated  with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including clostridium difficile infection (cdi). it has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic cdi, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. in addition, fmt has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-cdi diseases is in its infancy. more work needs to be done with fmt to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. there is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to  cure disease. fmt is but the first step in this journey.

TI  == using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  == new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology  laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.

TI  == effect of low-dose gaseous ozone on pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: treatment of chronically infected wounds is a challenge, and bacterial environmental contamination is a growing issue in infection control. ozone may have a role in these situations. the objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of gaseous ozone/oxygen mixture eliminates pathogenic bacteria cultivated in petri dishes. methods: a pilot study with 6 bacterial strains was made using different concentrations of ozone in an ozone-oxygen mixture to determine a minimally effective dose that completely eliminated bacterial growth. the small and apparently bactericidal gaseous dose of 20 mug/ml ozone/oxygen (1:99) mixture, applied for 5 min under atmospheric pressure was selected. in the 2nd phase, eight bacterial strains with well characterized resistance patterns were evaluated in vitro using agar-blood in adapted petri dishes (105 bacteria/dish). the cultures were divided into 3 groups: 1--ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture containing 20 mug of o(3)/ml for 5 min; 2--100% oxygen for 5 min; 3--baseline: no gas was used. results: the selected ozone dose was applied to the following eight strains: escherichia coli, oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to carbapenems, and pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. all isolates were completely inhibited by the ozone-oxygen mixture while growth occurred in the other 2 groups. conclusion: a single topical application by nebulization of a low ozone dose completely inhibited the growth of all potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with known resistance to antimicrobial agents.

(or 18.39, 95% ci 2.32-145.2) and enterococcus faecalis (or 10.7, 95% ci 1.27-89.9) showed a significant relationship with intrauterine inflammation processes. e. faecalis increased the risk for nec (or 6.13, 95% ci 1.059-37.6). we did not note a link between rop and genital tract colonisation. interestingly pda seems to be triggered by the presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa (or 2.38 95% ci 1.83-3.82). conclusion: our results show a link between k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus sp., e. faecalis and intrauterine infection. e. faecalis increases the risk for nec, and suggests a direct link between gram + bacteria, chorioamnionitis and nec.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from surgical site infections (ssi) in japan.
AB  == to investigate the trends of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens isolated from  surgical site infections (ssi), a japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide survey. seven main organisms were collected from ssi at 27 medical centers in 2010 and were shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. a total of 702 isolates from 586 patients with ssi were included. staphylococcus aureus (20.4 %) and enterococcus faecalis  (19.5 %) were the most common isolates, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4  %) and bacteroides fragilis group (15.4 %). methicillin-resistant s. aureus among s. aureus was 72.0 %. vancomycin mic 2 mug/ml strains accounted for 9.7 %. in escherichia coli, 11 of 95 strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/53 strains). of e. coli strains, 8.4 % were resistant to ceftazidime (caz) and 26.3 % to ciprofloxacin (cpfx). no p. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-beta-lactamase. in p. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4  % to tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), 10.2 % to imipenem (ipm), 2.8 % to meropenem, cefepime, and cpfx, and 0 % to gentamicin. in the b. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 % to clindamycin, 5.7 % to cefmetazole, 2.9 % to taz/pipc and ipm, and 0 % to metronidazole (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0  %). mic(9)(0) of p. aeruginosa isolated 15 days or later after surgery rose in taz/pipc, caz, ipm, and cpfx. in patients with american society of anesthesiologists (asa) score >/=3, the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa to taz/pipc and caz were higher than in patients with asa </=2. the data obtained in this study revealed the trend of the spread of resistance among common species that cause ssi. timing of isolation from surgery and the patient's physical status affected the selection of resistant organisms.

TI  == molecular structure, normal coordinate analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, natural bond orbital, td-dft calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  == in this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, nbo and homo, lumo analysis of umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7hc). the optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental xrd data. harmonic frequencies of 7hc were determined and analyzed by dft utilizing 6-311+g(d,p) as basis set. the assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of normal coordinate analysis (nca) following the scaled quantum mechanical force field methodology (sqmff). the change in electron density (ed) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies e(2) have been calculated by natural bond orbital (nbo) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. the energy and oscillator strength calculated by time-dependent density functional theory (td-dft) complements with the experimental findings. the simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against  staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, psuedomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, shigella  flexneri, salmonella typhi and enterococcus faecalis.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == species-level analysis of dna sequence data from the nih human microbiome project.
AB  == background: outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections emphasize the  importance of surveillance of potentially pathogenic bacteria. genomic sequencing of clinical microbiological specimens expands our capacity to study cultivable, fastidious and uncultivable members of the bacterial community. herein, we compared the primary data collected by the nih's human microbiome project (hmp) with published epidemiological surveillance data of staphylococcus aureus. methods: the hmp's initial dataset contained microbial survey data from five body regions (skin, nares, oral cavity, gut and vagina) of 242 healthy volunteers. a significant component of the hmp dataset was deep sequencing of the 16s ribosomal rna gene, which contains variable regions enabling taxonomic classification. since species-level identification is essential in clinical microbiology, we built a reference database and used phylogenetic placement followed by most recent common ancestor classification to look at the species distribution for staphylococcus, klebsiella and enterococcus. main results: we show that selecting the accurate region of the 16s rrna gene to sequence is analogous to carefully selecting culture conditions to distinguish closely related bacterial species. analysis of the hmp data showed that staphylococcus aureus was present in the nares of 36% of healthy volunteers, consistent with culture-based epidemiological data. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis were found less frequently, but across many habitats. conclusions: this work demonstrates that large 16s rrna survey studies can be used to support epidemiological goals in the context of an  increasing awareness that microbes flourish and compete within a larger bacterial community. this study demonstrates how genomic techniques and information could be critically important to trace microbial evolution and implement hospital infection control.

TI  == the relative importance of staphylococcus saprophyticus as a urinary tract pathogen: distribution of bacteria among urinary samples analysed during 1 year at a major swedish laboratory.
AB  == to determine the distribution of urinary tract pathogens with focus on staphylococcus saprophyticus and analyse the seasonality, antibiotic susceptibility, and gender and age distributions in a large swedish cohort. s. saprophyticus is considered an important causative agent of urinary tract infection (uti) in young women, and some earlier studies have reported up to approximately 40% of utis in this patient group being caused by s. saprophyticus. we hypothesized that this may be true only in very specific outpatient settings.  during the year 2010, 113,720 urine samples were sent for culture to the karolinska university hospital, from both clinics in the hospital and from primary care units. patient age, gender and month of sampling were analysed for s. saprophyticus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis.  species data were obtained for 42,633 (37%) of the urine samples. the most common pathogens were e. coli (57.0%), enterococcus faecalis (6.5%), k. pneumoniae (5.9%), group b streptococci (5.7%), p. mirabilis (3.0%) and s. saprophyticus (1.8%). the majority of subjects with s. saprophyticus were women 15-29 years of  age (63.8%). in this age group, s. saprophyticus constituted 12.5% of all urinary tract pathogens. s. saprophyticus is a common urinary tract pathogen in young women, but its relative importance is low compared with e. coli even in this patient group. for women in other ages and for men, growth of s. saprophyticus is a quite uncommon finding.

TI  == phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  == the volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the croatian endemic plant centaurea ragusina l. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. the chemical compositions, determined by gc and gc-ms, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. nonterpene hydrocarbons were  also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution  assays. they were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/ml. the volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with mic values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/ml against the gram-positive bacteria bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the gram-negative bacteria cronobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (mic  = 32-128 microg/ml).

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

AB  == objective: we compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. methods: a retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in manhattan. the main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. results: controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [ci], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; ci, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; ci, 1.5-5.4). patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; ci, 0.01-0.08). conclusions: with careful  matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. the difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.

TI  == comparison of the wst-8 colorimetric method and the clsi broth microdilution method for susceptibility testing against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) obtained from the susceptibility testing of various bacteria to antibiotics were determined by a colorimetric microbial viability assay based on reduction of a tetrazolium salt {2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazoli um, monosodium salt (wst-8)} via 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone as an electron mediator and compared with those obtained by the broth microdilution methods approved by the clinical and laboratory standard institute (clsi). especially for drug-resistant bacteria, the clsi method at an incubation time of 24h tended to give lower mics. the extension of incubation time was necessary to obtain consistent mics for drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococi (vre) and multi-drug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) in the broth microdilution method. there was excellent agreement between the mics determined after 24h using the wst-8 colorimetric method and those obtained after 48-96 h using the broth microdilution method. the results suggest that the wst-8 colorimetric assay is a  useful method for rapid determination of consistent mics for drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. escherichia coli is the most common uti pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. in this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. a total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. overall escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). data stratification  according to both age and gender showed e. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom p. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was  shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). susceptibility of e. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as  follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). in conclusion,  both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining utis etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.

TI  == total synthesis and biological evaluation of transvalencin z.
AB  == the emerging global epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis has created an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic approaches for disease treatment. transvalencin z (1) is a natural product from nocardia transvalensis with relatively potent and selective antimycobacterial activity against mycobacterium  smegmatis, making it an attractive target for structure-activity and mechanism of action studies. the total synthesis of the four possible diastereomers of transvalencin z was completed (1a-d), and the absolute configurations were defined using chemical synthesis, hplc retention times, and optical rotation measurements. surprisingly, none of the transvalencin z diastereomers exhibited any inhibitory activity against a panel of microbial pathogens, including several species of mycobacteria.

TI  == urine flow cytometry as a primary screening method to exclude urinary tract infections.
AB  == purpose: to exclude urinary tract infections, culture is the gold standard method, although it is time consuming and costly. current strategies using dipstick analysis are unsatisfactory as screening methods, because of inadequate  sensitivity/specificity. urine flow cytometry is an attractive alternative. to exclude urinary tract infections, a cutoff value to screen for negative cultures  was determined. methods: 281 outpatients (51 % male) of a general population visiting the urology department were included. urine samples were measured by flow cytometry and compared with culture results and dipstick analysis. roc analysis was performed to evaluate the screening performance of flow cytometry and dipstick analysis compared to culture. results: 18 % of cultures were positive, defined as >10(4) colony forming units/ml. bacterial count by flow cytometry alone provides the best sensitivity and specificity to exclude a urinary tract infection. a cutoff value of 60 bacteria/mul urine leads to a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 60 %. retrospectively, with a cutoff value of 60 bacteria/mul urine, 49 % of the cultures would have been redundant. 20 % of patients receiving antibiotics possibly had received those unnecessarily. the calculated percentage of false negatives was 0 % (95 % confidence interval 0-3.3 %). conclusions: urine flow cytometry is a reliable screening method to exclude urinary tract infections. with a cutoff value of 60 bacteria/mul urine, negative predictive value is 100 % and the calculated percentage of false negatives is 0 % (95 % confidence interval 0-3.3 %). using flow cytometry as a screening method could lead to a reduction in cultures and antibiotics.

TI  == reproducible discrimination between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using surface enhanced raman spectroscopy with infrared excitation.
AB  == the on time diagnostics of bacterial diseases is one of the essential steps in the foregoing treatment of such pathogens. here we sought to present an easy to use and robust method for the discrimination between gram-positive (enterococcus  faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial genera based on surface enhanced raman scattering (sers) spectroscopy. the robustness of our approach lies in the novel  method for the production of the ser substrate based on silver nanoparticles and  their subsequent re-crystallization in solutions containing high concentrations of chloride ions. the method presented here could be an interesting alternative both to commonly used histochemical approaches and commercial sers substrates.

TI  == sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  == we investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it  is now a clinical problem in japan. six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). major causative bacteria detected were escherichia coli (65.0 %), enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). from 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were e. coli (61.5 %), e. faecalis (13.7 %), k. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and s. agalactiae (4.0 %). the sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and cephems of e. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. in regard to infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [lvfx] >/=4 mug/ml), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of fq administration within 1 month. although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. the major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli were a history of fq administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. it was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of fq administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.

TI  == lif reduces mics of antibiotics against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (lif) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with lif were performed by microdilution method. mics were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. we observed reduced mics of antibiotics associated with lif ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. the strongest decreases of mics observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with lif against acinetobacter baumannii and streptococcus pneumoniae. an eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against s. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against a. baumannii and s. pneumoniae. this suggests that lif exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.

TI  == profile of antibiotic consumption, sensitivity and resistance in an urban area of andhra pradesh, india.
AB  == introduction: antibiotics are an important category of drugs in which indiscriminate use can affect the susceptibility patterns among infectious organisms, resulting in antibiotic resistance. methods: data on antibiotic usage  and susceptibility patterns were collected from public and private health centres in vijayawada, andhra pradesh, india, through the use of questionnaires. the data collected were then coded, tabulated, computed and evaluated using statistical analysis. results: the consumption profile of the different categories of drugs used in public and private hospitals was as follows: nutrition and metabolism products 19.0%; gastrointestinal disorder-related drugs 18.5%; antibiotics 16.8%; anti-pyretics and anti-analgesics 20.6%. these drugs were found to be in high demand. among the antibiotics, aminoglycosides (amikacin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), penicillin (ampicillin) and sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) were the most commonly prescribed drugs for antibiotic therapy. 46% of the culture laboratory reports were positive with the  following organism profile: escherichia coli (36%), klebsiella pneumoniae (16%),  staphylococcus aureus (29%), enterococcus faecalis (9%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). in terms of the sensitivity profile of antibacterials, amikacin (66.9%) was the only antibiotic showing sensitivity patterns, while the majority  of antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin, had acquired a resistance rate of 55.1%-80.6%. conclusion: the results of this study suggest that indiscriminate prescription and consumption of new broad-spectrum antibiotics against sensitive organisms results in the development of antimicrobial resistance. therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the excessive use of antibiotics in local hospitals in order to control the  trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics.

TI  == microbial spectrum and resistance patterns in endophthalmitis: a 21-year (1988-2008) review in northeast united states.
AB  == purpose: to study the microbial spectrum and antibacterial susceptibility of vitreous cultures in a tertiary referral center in northeast united states. methods: all vitreous samples sent to the microbiology laboratory at a tertiary referral center from january 1988 to december 2008 were included in the study. the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates from culture-positive samples were compared across 3 equal time periods 1988-1994, 1995-2001, and 2002-2008. results: one hundred forty-three positive cultures, where 11.9% (n=17) were polymicrobial, yielded a total of 160 isolates that consisted of 80.6% (n=129) gram-positive isolates, 12.5% (n=20) gram-negative isolates, and 6.9% (n=11) fungal isolates. the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons) (37.5%, n=60), viridans streptococcus (11.3%, n=18), and streptococcus pneumoniae (6.9%, n=11). other common gram-positive isolates include propionibacterium acnes (5.6%, n=9), other streptococcus species (4.4%, n=7), staphylococcus aureus (4.4%, n=7), and enterococcus faecalis (3.8%, n=6). the most common gram-negative isolates were klebsiella species (3.1%, n=5), moraxella species (3.1%, n=5), and haemophilus species (2.5%, n=4). vancomycin was effective against all cons, sta. aureus, viridans streptococcus, and e. faecalis tested, and all sta. aureus isolates were oxacillin sensitive. of all cons isolates, 83.3% during 1988-1994, 73.1% during 1995-2001, and 100% during 2002-2008 were resistant to at least 1 of the antibiotics tested in the study with the last time period showing an increase in  resistance (p=0.021, adjusted standard residual=2.0). cons showed a decreasing resistance over time to chloramphenicol and gentamicin (p=0.010, p=0.007, respectively) and an increase in resistance to penicillin and tetracycline during 2002-2008 (p=0.003, p=0.040, respectively). susceptibility to other antibiotics did not show significant dependence on time. conclusion: bacteria causing endophthalmitis showed variable resistance to antibiotics over time. the importance of adequately treating endophthalmitis in the setting of these resistance pattern changes stresses the importance of periodic evaluation of causative organisms to ensure appropriate empiric treatment.

AB  == background: use of antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement to treat orthopaedic infections continues to remain popular, but resistance to routinely used antibiotics has led to the search for alternative, more effective antibiotics. we studied, in vitro, the elution kinetics and bio-activity of different concentrations of meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement. methods: meropenem-loaded bone cement cylinders of different concentrations were serially immersed in normal saline. elution kinetics was studied by measuring the drug concentration in the eluate, collected at pre-determined intervals, by high-performance liquid  chromatography. bio-activity of the eluate of two different antibiotic concentrations was tested for a period of 3 weeks against each of the following organisms: staphylococcus aureus atcc 2593 (mssa), enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, escherichia coli atcc 25922, s. aureus  atcc 43300 (mrsa) and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 700603 (esbl). results: meropenem elutes from acrylic bone cement for a period of 3-27 days depending on  the concentration of antibiotic. higher doses of antibiotic concentration resulted in greater elution of the antibiotic. the eluate was found to be biologically active against s. aureus atcc 2593 (mssa), p. aeruginosa atcc 27853, e. coli atcc 25922 and k. pneumoniae atcc 700603 (esbl) for a period of 3 weeks.  conclusions: the elution of meropenem is in keeping with typical antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement elution characteristics. the use of high-dose meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement seems to be an attractive option for treatment of resistant gram-negative orthopaedic infections but needs to be tested in vivo.

TI  == fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever in adults: emphasizing the evolutionary pre-fatal  clinical and laboratory manifestations.
AB  == background: a better description of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of fatal patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (dhf) is important in alerting clinicians of severe dengue and improving management. methods and findings: of 309 adults with dhf, 10 fatal patients and 299 survivors (controls) were retrospectively analyzed. regarding causes of fatality, massive gastrointestinal  (gi) bleeding was found in 4 patients, dengue shock syndrome (dss) alone in 2; dss/subarachnoid hemorrhage, klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia, ventilator associated pneumonia, and massive gi bleeding/enterococcus faecalis bacteremia each in one. fatal patients were found to have significantly higher frequencies of early altered consciousness (</=24 h after hospitalization), hypothermia, gi bleeding/massive gi bleeding, dss, concurrent bacteremia with/without shock, pulmonary edema, renal/hepatic failure, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. among those experienced early altered consciousness, massive gi bleeding alone/with uremia/with e. faecalis bacteremia, and k. pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia were each found in one patient. significantly higher proportion of bandemia from initial (arrival) laboratory data in fatal patients as compared to controls, and higher proportion of pre-fatal leukocytosis and lower pre-fatal platelet count as compared to initial laboratory data of fatal patients were found. massive gi bleeding (33.3%) and bacteremia (25%) were the major causes of pre-fatal leukocytosis in the deceased patients; 33.3% of the patients with pre-fatal profound thrombocytopenia (<20,000/microl), and 50% of the patients with pre-fatal prothrombin time (pt) prolongation experienced massive gi bleeding. conclusions: our report highlights causes of fatality other  than dss in patients with severe dengue, and suggested hypothermia, leukocytosis  and bandemia may be warning signs of severe dengue. clinicians should be alert to the potential development of massive gi bleeding, particularly in patients with early altered consciousness, profound thrombocytopenia, prolonged pt and/or leukocytosis. antibiotic(s) should be empirically used for patients at risk for bacteremia until it is proven otherwise, especially in those with early altered consciousness and leukocytosis.

TI  == garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  == when thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. as the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. in the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (allium sativum). wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (garo) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. garo prevented biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within enterococcus faecalis biofilms. additionally, garo disrupted partially developed  biofilms produced by s. aureus, s. epidermidis and a. baumannii. the antistaphylococcal activity of garo was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. thus, garo could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound  biofilms caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == degradation, mineralization and antibiotic inactivation of amoxicillin by uv-a/tio(2) photocatalysis.
AB  == the uv-a/tio(2) photocatalytic decomposition of amoxicillin (amx) in aqueous suspensions was investigated. experiments were performed at antibiotic concentrations between 2.5 and 30 mg/l, eight commercially available tio(2) catalysts at loadings between 100 and 750 mg/l, acidic or near-neutral conditions (ph 5 or 7.5) and two different matrices (ultrapure water and secondary treated effluent) at a photon flux of 8 x 10(-4) e/(l min). of the various catalysts tested, degussa p25 was highly active, i.e. complete amx degradation and 93% mineralization could be achieved after 25 and 90 min of reaction, respectively at 10 mg/l amx and 250 mg/l titania. in general, mineralization was slower than degradation due to the formation of stable transformation by-products. for the range of concentrations studied, initial degradation rates can be approached by a langmuir-hinshelwood kinetic model, while the reaction order with respect to amx  shifts from first to zeroth as initial concentration increases from 2.5 to 5 mg/l to higher values. degradation in treated effluent was partly impeded compared to  pure water due to the inherent presence of organic and inorganic constituents that compete for hydroxyl radicals. although increasing solution ph from 5 to 7.5 had no effect on degradation, it retarded mineralization. the antibiotic activity of amx prior to and after photocatalytic degradation was tested to three reference bacterial strains, namely escherichia coli (atcc 23716), klebsiella pneumoniae (nctc 5056) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 14506). the first two were found to be highly resistant at amx concentrations up to 25 mg/l, while the latter could partly be inactivated at lower amx concentrations (i.e. 10 mg/l) and/or in the presence of photocatalytic by-products.

TI  == a self-loading microfluidic device for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics.
AB  == this article describes a portable microfluidic technology for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of antibiotics against bacteria. the microfluidic platform consists of a set of chambers molded in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms) that are preloaded with antibiotic, dried, and reversibly sealed to a second layer of pdms containing channels that connect the  chambers. the assembled device is degassed via vacuum prior to its use, and the absorption of gas by pdms provides the mechanism for actuating and metering the flow of fluid in the microfluidic channels and chambers. during the operation of  the device, degas driven flow introduces a suspension of bacterial cells, dissolves the antibiotic, and isolates cells in individual chambers without cross contamination. the growth of bacteria in the chambers in the presence of a ph indicator produces a colorimetric change that can be detected visually using ambient light. using this device we measured the mic of vancomycin, tetracycline, and kanamycin against enterococcus faecalis 1131, proteus mirabilis hi4320, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli mg1655 and report values that are comparable to standard liquid broth dilution measurements. the device provides a  simple method for mic determination of individual antibiotics against human pathogens that will have applications for clinical and point-of-care medicine. importantly, this device is designed around simplicity: it requires a single pipetting step to introduce the sample, no additional components or external equipment for its operation, and provides a straightforward visual measurement of cell growth. as the device introduces a novel approach for filling and isolating  dead-end microfluidic chambers that does not require valves and actuators, this technology should find applications in other portable assays and devices.

TI  == [the first experience of application of pcr techniques in real-time mode to diagnose bacteriemia during postoperational period in cardiosurgery patients].
AB  == the results comparison is made between pcr polymerase chain reaction techniques in real-time mode and cultural techniques of analysis of blood samples in patients with suspicion of bacteriemia during early postoperational period. from  september to december 2009 43 blood samples from 37 adult patients aged 59+9.2 years were analyzed on suspicion of bacteriemia. the blood samples for pcr analysis (septifast technique roche diagnostics, switzerland) were taken parallel to the inoculation. among 43 samples 20 (46.5%) were positive. the species structure of identified germs was as follows: enteroccocus faecalis - 2, klebsiella pneumonia - 2, enteroccocusfaecium - 1, pseudomonas aeruginosa - 2, coagulase negative staphilococcus - 11. all cases of seeding of coagulase negative staphilococcus were interpreted using pcr techniques as negative or contamination. in four cases a full matching of results of compared techniques was obtained. in cases when hemoculture was negative (n = 23) the pcr techniques  permitted to detect two positive results (staphilococcus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia). in three cases of positive hemoculture the pcr techniques brought negative result and at that in two cases the causative agents  (pseudomonas fluorescens and ralstonia mannitolilytica) were out of specter of pathogens detected by this method. the pcr techniques in real-time mode permit to reduce significantly time of pathogen investigation and to detect the false positive results conditioned by contamination. this techniques has to be applied  in parallel with cultural technique because only this approach provide a possibility to get the clinically needed data related to the sensitivity of causative agent to antibacterial preparations.

TI  == antibacterial activity of some african medicinal plants used traditionally against infectious diseases.
AB  == context: plants are known to play a crucial role in african traditional medicine  for the treatment of infection diseases. objectives: to investigate the claimed antimicrobial properties of plants traditionally used in african countries, providing scientific validation for their use. materials and methods: eighty-three polar and non-polar extracts from 22 medicinal plants were screened  for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae) and mycobacterium smegmatis using the broth microdilution method. results and discussion: in vitro antibacterial activity against one or more tested bacteria was shown by 83% of the extracts. the highest activity was obtained with the methanol extracts of the aerial parts of acacia karroo hayne (fabaceae) and anacardium occidentale l. (anacardiaceae) and the roots of bridelia cathartica g. bertol (euphorbiaceae), against s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 7.5 microg/ml). the same mic values were exhibited against e. faecalis by the methanol extract of a. occidentale, the dichloromethane and methanol extracts of b. cathartica and the ethyl acetate extract of momordica balsamina l. (curcubitaceae) leaves. gram-negative bacteria  were less sensitive; the growth of p. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited (mic = 31 microg/ml) by the n-hexane and methanol extracts of gomphocarpus fruticosus  (l.) ait. (asclepiadaceae) fruits and by the dichloromethane extract of trichilia emetica vahl (meliaceae) seeds. most of the active extracts were rich in fenols/flavonoids. conclusion: this study supports the use of most of the studied plants in traditional medicine, for the treatment of infectious diseases. some of them are worthy of further investigation.

TI  == role of antibiofilm-antimicrobial agents in controlling device-related infections.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of n-acetylcysteine (nac) on organism viability in planktonic and biofilm phases, biofilm thickness, and extracellular polysaccharide content. methods: we performed time-kill curves and broth macrodilution assays of bacterial and fungal clinical isolates with varying concentrations of nac. we also created in vitro bacterial biofilms, incubated them with nac or control, and then stained with propidium iodide and fitc-labeled concanavalin a. we measured biofilm thickness, number of non-viable cells, and fluorescent intensity as a marker of extracellular matrix via a confocal laser scanning microscope. all experiments were conducted in triplicate. tested organisms included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa, mrsa), s. epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans and c. krusei. results: nac 80 mg/ml was uniformly bactericidal (>99.9%  reduction) against all tested bacteria with no recoverable organisms after 30 minutes of incubation, but was fungistatic against candida species. minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of nac ranged from 5-10 mg/ml. biofilm thickness was significantly decreased in nac-treated biofilms for all organisms except vre. the number of non-viable cells in nac-treated gram-positive biofilms  was increased (p<0.05 for mrsa and vre). nac-treated gram-negative biofilms had scant cellularity and lacked complex 3-dimensional structures that were characteristic of controls. fluorescent intensity was similar in the experimental and control arms. conclusions: nac is bactericidal against clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria and also leads to biofilm disruption. nac has the potential for use as a novel agent for prevention or treatment of biofilm-related infections.

TI  == predictors of in-hospital mortality in elderly patients with bacteraemia admitted to an internal medicine ward.
AB  == background: infectious diseases are a common cause of increased morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. bacteraemia in the elderly is a difficult diagnosis and a therapeutic challenge due to age-related vicissitudes and to their comorbidities. the main purpose of the study was to assess independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality among the elderly with bacteraemia admitted to  an internal medicine ward. methods: overall, a cohort of 135 patients, 65 years of age and older, with bacteraemia were retrospectively studied. data related to  demographic information, comorbidities, clinical parameters on admission, source  and type of infection, microorganism isolated in the blood culture, laboratory data and empirical antibiotic treatment was recorded from each patient. multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality. results: of these 135 patients, 45.9% were women. the most common infections in this group of patients were urinary tract infections (46.7%). the main microorganisms isolated in the blood cultures were escherichia coli (14.9%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (12.0%), non-mrsa (11.4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.1%) and enterococcus faecalis (8.0%). the in-hospital mortality was 22.2%. independent prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age >/= 85 years, chronic renal disease, bacteraemia of unknown focus and cognitive impairment at admission (or,  2.812 [95% ci, 1.039-7.611; p = 0.042]; or, 6.179 [95% ci, 1.840-20.748; p = 0.003]; or, 8.673 [95% ci, 1.557-48.311; p = 0.014] and or, 3.621 [95% ci, 1.226-10.695; p = 0.020], respectively). by multivariate analysis appropriate antibiotic therapy was not associated with lower odds of mortality. conclusion: bacteraemia in the elderly has a high mortality rate. there are no set of signs or clinical features that can predict bacteraemia in the elderly. however, older  age (>/= 85 years), chronic renal disease, bacteraemia of unknown focus and severe cognitive impairment adversely affects the outcome of elderly patients with bacteraemia admitted to an internal medicine ward.

TI  == the revival of fosfomycin.
AB  == fosfomycin, originally named phosphonomycin, was discovered in spain in 1969. there are three forms of fosfomycin: fosfomycin tromethamine (a soluble salt) and fosfomycin calcium for oral use, and fosfomycin disodium for intravenous use. fosfomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis  in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by inhibiting the initial step involving phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase. it has a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. it is highly active against gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus, and against gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae. its unique mechanism of action may provide a synergistic effect to other classes of antibiotics including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. oral fosfomycin is mainly used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, particularly those caused by escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. intravenous fosfomycin has been administered in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. fosfomycin has good distribution into tissues, achieving clinically relevant concentrations  in serum, kidneys, bladder wall, prostate, lungs, inflamed tissues, bone, cerebrospinal fluid, abscess fluid, and heart valves. fosfomycin is well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. further randomized controlled  trials are needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous fosfomycin for the management of nosocomial infections due to mdr pathogens.

TI  == synergistic and antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  == the effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains on tyramine (tyr) and also other biogenic amines (ba) production by eight common food-borne pathogen (fbp) in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (tdb) was investigated by using a rapid hplc method. significant differences were observed among the fbp strains in ammonia (amn) and  ba production apart from tryptamine, histamine (his) and spermine formation (p<0.05). salmonella paratyphi a was characterised as the main amine producer. lab had an important synergetic role in some ba production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria, although the effect of some lab strains on ba production was strain-dependent. lactococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. resulted in significantly higher tyr accumulation by aeromonas hydrophila and enterococcus faecalis in tdb. the presence of lactococcus and/or lactobacillus in tdb significantly increased his production by a. hydrophila, escherichia coli, ent. faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas his accumulation was significantly reduced by staphylococcus aureus, s. paratyphi a and listeria monocytogenes.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

TI  == [trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in romania. experience of participation in earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system), 2002-2008].
AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

TI  == the challenges of antimicrobial resistance in brazil.
AB  == brazil is a country with continental proportions with high geographic and economic diversity. despite its medical centers of excellence, antimicrobial resistance poses a major therapeutic challenge. rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus are up to 60% and are related to an endemic brazilian clone. local resistance to vancomycin in enterococci was first related to enterococcus faecalis, which differs from european and american epidemiology. also, local klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have a much higher prevalence (40%-50% and 10%-18%, respectively). carbapenem resistance among the enterobacteriaceae group  is becoming a major problem, and k. pneumoniae carbapenemase isolates have been reported in different states. among nonfermenters, carbapenem resistance is strongly related to spm-1 (pseudomonasaeruginosa) and oxa-23 (acinetobacter baumannii complex) enzymes, and a colistin-only susceptible phenotype has also emerged in these isolates, which is worrisome. local actions without loosing the  global resistance perspective will demand multidisciplinary actions, new policies, and political engagement.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of nemonoxacin, a novel non-fluorinated quinolone.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of nemonoxacin, a novel c8-methoxy non-fluorinated quinolone in murine systemic and local infection models. methods: the efficacy of nemonoxacin in systemic infections was evaluated in mouse peritonitis models using isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, n=1), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, n=1), methicillin- and levofloxacin-resistant staphylococcus capitis (levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, n=1), penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp, n=1), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, n=2), enterococcus faecalis (n=2, including 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, vre) and escherichia coli (n=3). the local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by prsp (n=1), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and mouse ascending  urinary tract infection caused by e. coli (n=1). results: in the mouse systemic infection model, nemonoxacin demonstrated potent activity against mssa (ed(50) =2.08 mg/kg), mrsa (ed(50) =2.59 mg/kg), levofloxacin-resistant mrsc (ed(50) =2.52 mg/kg), pisp (ed(50) =5.47 mg/kg), prsp (ed(50) =3.68-5.28 mg/kg) and e. coli (ed(50) =3.13-5.28 mg/kg), and moderate activity towards e. faecalis infection (ed(50) =8.48-15.16 mg/kg). the therapeutic efficacy of nemonoxacin was significantly higher (p<0.01) than that of levofloxacin in infections caused by gram-positive isolates (mssa, mrsa, levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, pisp, prsp and e. faecalis), but less potent than that of levofloxacin against e. coli infection (p<0.01). nemonoxacin in vivo efficacy results with gram-positive isolates (2- to 5-fold ed(50) advantage over levofloxacin) are consistent with the mic data (4- to 16-fold mic advantage of nemonoxacin over levofloxacin). in the mouse pulmonary infection model, nemonoxacin showed potent activity towards prsp (higher than levofloxacin) and k. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin) infections. in the mouse ascending urinary tract infection model, nemonoxacin exhibited potent activity against e. coli infection (lower than levofloxacin). conclusions: the results validated the potent efficacy of nemonoxacin in vivo. the higher efficacy of nemonoxacin than of levofloxacin towards infections caused by gram-positive cocci (especially mrsa, levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, prsp and vre) warrants investigation of its clinical use.

TI  == [evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of vale do sousa and tamega].
AB  == the urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary  tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. from february 2008 to january 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. from these cultures 1037 were positive. from this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. in bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. it was verified that the most frequent microorganism was escherichia coli, followed by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. for antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. for klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. in conclusion, this study shows that escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae are the  three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. a periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to  help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric utis.
AB  == aims: to test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (uti) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. methods and results: toluidine blue (tb), methylene blue (mb), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ala), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical uti-implicated pathogens staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm led-illuminated conditions. tb and mb were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being  assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with  the other compounds. trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ala required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. conclusions: tb and mb were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. significance and impact of the study: ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. the photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == detection of leptospira in urine using anti-leptospira-coated gold nanoparticles.
AB  == serological assays for antibody detection have been widely used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, antibody is usually undetectable during the first week after  infection. detection of leptospira dna can be done by pcr but this technique requires special equipments and the cost is still relatively high. here we demonstrate that gold nanoparticles can be used to facilitate leptospira detection. gold nanoparticles were coated with rabbit antibody specific to leptospira interrogans serovar bratislava and these coated particles were used to detect leptospira in urine. agglutination of gold particles indicated the presence of leptospira in samples tested. the sensitivity of detection was 10 leptospires/ml. no agglutination was observed when anti-leptospira-coated particles were tested with urine containing the organisms commonly found in urine such as klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. this assay is very easy to perform and results could be observed with the naked eyes.  fresh or frozen urine samples could be used. the stability of antibody-coated particles was at least 2 months when kept at 4 degrees c. in conclusion, we have  demonstrated that the technique using antibody-coated gold nanoparticles is a promising tool for further validation as a rapid assay for leptospirosis diagnosis.

TI  == impact of a change in antibiotic prophylaxis on total antibiotic use in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. methods: in january 2004, the use of antibiotic  prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (icu). prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (csf) drainage. the effect on the antibiotic use density (ad: ddd [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (january 2002-december 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(january 2004-december 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. resistance proportions(rp) and resistance densities (rd), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis or e. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3gc) escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. results: total antibiotic  use by 147 ddd/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 ddd/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887ddd/1,000 pd post-intervention.  this decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. the reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. the rr  and rd of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli increased after january 2004, whereas the percentage of mrsa significantly decreased. conclusion: change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. it would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical icus may be very worthwhile.

TI  == is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  == objective: surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. these exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. the association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. design: prospective cohort study during 24 months. setting: eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. patients: all inpatients. interventions: none. measurements and main results: primary isolates  of six indicator organisms (acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant s. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. surveillance of nosocomial  infection rates was performed according to the german nosocomial infection surveillance system, krankenhaus infektions surveillance system. transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate spearman's rank-correlation test. during 100,781 patient days, 100,829  microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6  transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration  of hospitalization, or device use. conclusions: differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.

TI  == uropathogen interaction with the surface of urological stents using different surface properties.
AB  == purpose: ureteral stents commonly become infected or encrusted. various coatings  have been developed to decrease bacterial adherence. to our knowledge there has been no in vitro testing of coating with heparin to date. we determined the effects of heparin coating on bacterial adherence of common uropathogens and physical stent properties. materials and methods: heparin coated radiance ureteral stents (cook) and noncoated endo-sof control stents were tested against  triclosan eluting triumph(r) stents and noneluting polaris control stents for adherence of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa for 7 days. adherent bacteria were determined and biofilms were visualized using fluorescent dyes. radial, tensile and coil strength of the radiance and polaris stents was compared to determine the effect of heparin coating on physical stent characteristics. results: heparin coating did not decrease bacterial adhesion compared to its control. e. coli adhesion was limited by all stents tested. the polaris stent showed significantly greater resistance to bacterial adherence for klebsiella, pseudomonas and enterococcus than the endo-sof and radiance stents but was more susceptible to s. aureus adherence. the triumph stent resisted all bacteria except pseudomonas and enterococcus. mature biofilms were observed on all stents  with lower viability on the triumph stent. radiance stents showed higher tensile  and lower compression strength than its control. conclusions: heparin coating does not decrease bacterial adherence to ureteral stents. drug eluting antimicrobials have an inhibitory effect on bacterial adherence and the polaris stent showed the least bacterial adherence of the nondrug eluting ureteral stents tested.

TI  == catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  == urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, centre for paraplegia of the clinical centre of the university of sarajevo, were included. the patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: group a (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; group b (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; group c (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. from a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. more than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. the overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. the vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by proteus mirabilis (16,3%), escherichia coli (11,8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), morganella morgani (5,4%), acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were gram-positive with enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), providencia rettgeri (86,7%), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (85,4%), providencia stuarti (84,3%) and morganella morgani (81,0%). lower rates of resistance were found in group c, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. the analysis of group c showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two groups of patients. the objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. in addition, possible correlations between uti and the type of bladder  management were examined.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infections in a saudi arabian hospital.
AB  == the study describes the pathogens causing urinary tract infections (uti) and the  antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of health care-associated (hca) and community-acquired (ca) isolates. of the total of 3,989 nonrepetitive urinary cultures, 4.7% (n=188) were hca and 95.3% (n=3,801) were ca isolates. gram-negative organisms totaled 3,607 (90.4%) vs. 9.6% gram-positive organisms. in ca-uti, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis constituted 66, 11.4, and 5.4%, respectively. hca-uti episodes were caused by e.  coli (37.8%), k. pneumoniae (14.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%). the susceptibility rates of e. coli to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx), nitrofurantoin and ceftriaxone in hca and ca isolates were 53.3 and 74.1%, 42.2 and 62.7%, 32.5 and 97.0%, and 62.3 and 92.7%, respectively. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was detected in 8.1 and 7.4% isolates, respectively, of ca and hca isolates of e. coli. ca isolates of k. pneumoniae were more susceptible to tmp-smx (89.2 vs. 60.4%), ciprofloxacin (92.6 vs. 67.9%) and cefuroxime (93.8 vs. 24.5%) than hca isolates. the susceptibility  of hca and ca isolates of e. faecalis to penicillin g and nitrofurantoin were 34.8 and 80%, and 78.3 and 93.6%, respectively (p<0.001). in conclusion, antimicrobial resistance is high to commonly used oral agents, rendering them inappropriate for empirical use.

TI  == novel e. coli beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii inhibitors as targeted antibiotics.
AB  == beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (kas) iii is a condensing enzyme that initiates fatty acid biosynthesis in most bacteria. we determined three pharmacophore maps from receptor-oriented pharmacophore-based in silico screening of the x-ray structure of escherichia coli kas iii (eckas iii) and choose 16 compounds as candidate eckas iii inhibitors. binding inhibitors were characterized using saturation-transfer difference nmr spectroscopy (std-nmr), and binding constants were determined with fluorescence quenching experiments. based on the results, we propose that the antimicrobial compound, 4-cyclohexyliminomethyl-benzene-1,3-diol (ykas3003), is a potent inhibitor of pathogenic kas iii, displaying minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values in the range 128-256 microg/ml against various bacteria.

TI  == bacteremia coexisting with tophaceous gout of the spine mimicking spondylodiscitis: a case report.
AB  == study design: a case report and review of the literature. objective: to report a  rare case of bacteremia coexisting with spinal gout initially suspected as pyogenic spondylodiscitis. summary of background data: gouty spine is a rare disease. it is even rare when coexisting with bacteremia. the presentation as pain, fever, and positive blood culture will make it more difficult to distinguish from spinal infection. methods: a 64-year-old woman with type ii diabetes mellitus and chronic renal insufficiency was admitted to the emergency department with a fever of 39 degrees c, chills, and back pain. laboratory studies revealed an elevated white count and neutrophils; her serum glucose level was 279 mg/dl. the c-reactive protein level was 25.55 mg/dl and serum uric acid was in the upper range of normal. blood cultures revealed escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. urine culture revealed 3 separate gram-negative bacilli. magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed  contrast enhancement in the l4-l5 and t5-t9 vertebral bodies. infective spondylodiscitis of the lumbar and thoracic spine was suspected. results: because antibiotic treatment had failed, surgical debridement with diskectomy, partial corpectomy, and allogenous strut graft reconstruction (t8-t9) was performed. during the operation, 600 cc of pleural effusion was drained. chalky white material was noted at the t8-t9 disc and the adjacent vertebral bodies. cultures  for bacteria, tuberculosis, and fungus were all negative. histologic examination  revealed deposition of eosinophilic crystal-like material, and a diagnosis of tophaceous gout of the spine was established. conclusion: this is, to our knowledge, the first case of bacteremia coexisting with multiple areas of tophaceous gout of the spine. although uncommon, gouty spine should be added into the differential diagnosis of patients with back pain and bacteremia.

TI  == large scale multiplex pcr improves pathogen detection by dna microarrays.
AB  == background: medium density dna microchips that carry a collection of probes for a broad spectrum of pathogens, have the potential to be powerful tools for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. however, their widespread use in microbiological diagnostics is limited by the problem of low pathogen numbers in  clinical specimens revealing relatively low amounts of pathogen dna. results: to  increase the detection power of a fluorescence-based prototype-microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis, we propose a large scale multiplex pcr (lsplex pcr) for amplification of several dozens of gene-segments of 9 pathogenic species. this protocol employs a large set of primer pairs, potentially able to amplify 800 different gene segments that correspond to the capture probes spotted on the microarray. the lsplex protocol is shown to selectively amplify only the gene segments corresponding to the specific pathogen present in the analyte. application of lsplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 100 to 1000. conclusion:  our data provide a proof of principle for the improvement of detection of pathogen dna by microarray hybridization by using lsplex pcr.

TI  == [biochemical and bacteriological investigation of six cases of purple urine bag syndrome (pubs) in a geriatric ward for dementia].
AB  == aim: purple urine bag syndrome is a condition in which the urinary catheter bag turns purple. a tryptophan-indigo hypothesis has been proposed as the mechanism of pubs, in which bacterial decomposition of tryptophan in gut associated with chronic constipation, bacterial overgrowth in the urinary tract and alkaline urine causes production of indigo and discoloration. we considered that further investigation of cases was needed. methods: we investigated 6 cases exhibiting pubs (3 males and 3 females). results: all cases had chronic constipation. oral ingestion was impossible in one case. pubs disappeared after antibiotic treatment (3 cases) or spontaneously (one case). alkaline urine and indicanuria were not found in all cases that showed the disappearance of pubs. in bacterial culture of urine during the exhibition of pubs, enterococcus faecalis was isolated together  with morganella morganii (3 cases) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (one case). single  infections by klebsiella pneumoniae or citrobacter species were also found. after disappearance of pubs, infected bacterial species changed but no cases showed sterile urine. urine and blood alpha-amino-n-butyric acid levels reduced after the disappearance of pubs whereas tryptophan levels did not show related changes. in one case, blood protein concentration increased after the spontaneous disappearance of pubs. indicanuria and alkalization of urine from urinary catheter bag were more intense than of fresh urine. conclusions: the present results generally support the 'tryptophan-indigo hypothesis'. furthermore, it was suggested that additional factors associated with the occurrence of pubs are an environment that facilitates specific bacterial growth in a hospital as well as abnormal metabolism relating to alpha-amino-n-butyric acid and reduced protein synthesis in patients.

TI  == role of human cd36 in bacterial recognition, phagocytosis, and pathogen-induced jnk-mediated signaling.
AB  == scavenger receptor cd36 mediates staphylococcus aureus phagocytosis and initiates tlr2/6 signaling. we analyzed the role of cd36 in the uptake and tlr-independent  signaling of various bacterium, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, s. aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. expression of human cd36 in hela cells increased the uptake of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria compared with the control mock-transfected cells. bacterial adhesion was associated with pathogen phagocytosis. upon cd36 transfection, hek293 cells, which demonstrate no tlr2/4 expression, acquired lps  responsiveness as assessed by il-8 production. the cells demonstrated a marked 5- to 15-fold increase in cytokine release upon exposure to gram-negative bacteria,  while the increase was much smaller (1.5- to 3-fold) with gram-positive bacteria  and lipoteichoic acid. cd36 down-regulation utilizing cd36 small interfering rna  reduced cytokine release by 40-50% in human fibroblasts induced by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as lps. of all mapk signaling cascade inhibitors tested, only the inhibitor of jnk, a stress-activated protein  kinase, potently blocked e. coli/lps-stimulated cytokine production. nf-kappab inhibitors were ineffective, indicating direct tlr-independent signaling. jnk activation was confirmed by western blot analyses of phosphorylated jkn1/2 products. synthetic amphipathic peptides with an alpha-helical motif were shown to be efficient inhibitors of e. coli- and lps-induced il-8 secretion as well as  jnk1/2 activation/phosphorylation in cd36-overexpressing cells. these results indicate that cd36 functions as a phagocytic receptor for a variety of bacteria and mediates signaling induced by gram-negative bacteria and lps via a jnk-mediated signaling pathway in a tlr2/4-independent manner.

TI  == dual fluorescence system for flow cytometric analysis of escherichia coli transcriptional response in multi-species context.
AB  == when studying interspecies interactions in a bacterial consortium, it may be desirable to analyze one species' transcriptional response as influenced by the other species. we developed a dual fluorescence system of escherichia coli for fluorescence-activated cell sorter (facs)-based analysis for such a purpose. first, we generated e. coli scc1 strain, which constitutively expresses green fluorescent protein (gfp), but otherwise showed no observable difference from the parent strain mg1655 with respect to morphology, growth, and facs-analyzed side-  and forward-scatter profiles. next, to analyze transcriptional response, plasmids carrying promoters of interest fused to a red fluorescent protein (asred2) reporter, were introduced into strain scc1. quantification of promoter activities of arab, lacz, fadb and rpoe via asred2 reporter verified that the induction levels are similar between mg1655 and scc1 strains. in mixtures and co-cultures,  gfp expression of e. coli scc1 allowed it to be separated from non-e. coli species by facs to purity levels of 96.7-100.0%. when a mixture of e. coli scc1 carrying promoter-asred2 fusion and a non-e. coli strain was analyzed by facs, it enabled (i) distinction of e. coli scc1 from the non-e. coli strain, (ii) analysis of the e. coli promoter activity via asred2 expression and (iii) identification of transcriptional heterogeneity within the e. coli population. co-cultures of e. coli scc1 with klebsiella pneumoniae and/or enterococcus faecalis analyzed by facs showed that e. coli fadb and rpoe transcription were differentially influenced by partner species.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the formation of crystalline biofilms by mixed communities of urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == the crystalline bacterial biofilms that encrust foley catheters compromise the care of many elderly and disabled patients. the aim of this study was to examine  whether the biocide triclosan can prevent encrustation by the mixed flora of uropathogens that commonly infect patients undergoing long-term catheterization.  models of the catheterized bladder were inoculated with communities of organisms  isolated from patients who were experiencing catheter blockage. the catheter retention balloons were inflated with water or triclosan (3 g triclosan l(-1) in  0.1 m sodium carbonate) and urine was supplied to the models for up to 7 days. the effect of triclosan was recorded on the viable cell populations, the ph of the residual urine and the times that catheters took to block. the extent of encrustation of the catheters was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. in  models inoculated with communities containing proteus mirabilis, triclosan prevented the rise in urinary ph that drives crystalline biofilm formation and catheter blockage. the biocide had no effect on populations of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and  klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated from the residual urine and the catheters drained freely for the 7-day experimental period. in models inoculated with a mixed community containing providencia rettgeri, catheters inflated with triclosan continued to block rapidly. although k. pneumoniae and proteus vulgaris were eliminated from the residual urine, there was no effect on the viability of  providencia rettgeri. the results indicate that the triclosan strategy should be  limited to the treatment of patients who are infected with proteus mirabilis.

TI  == streptozocin-induced diabetic mouse model of urinary tract infection.
AB  == diabetics have a higher incidence of urinary tract infection (uti), are infected  with a broader range of uropathogens, and more commonly develop serious uti sequelae than nondiabetics. to better study uti in the diabetic host, we created  and characterized a murine model of diabetic uti using the pancreatic islet beta-cell toxin streptozocin in c3h/hen, c3h/hej, and c57bl/6 mouse backgrounds.  intraperitoneal injections of streptozocin were used to initiate diabetes in healthy mouse backgrounds, as defined by consecutive blood glucose levels of >250 mg/dl. utis caused by uropathogenic escherichia coli (uti89), klebsiella pneumoniae (top52 1721), and enterococcus faecalis (0852) were studied, and diabetic mice were found to be considerably more susceptible to infection. all three uropathogens produced significantly higher bladder and kidney titers than buffer-treated controls. uropathogens did not have as large an advantage in the toll-like receptor 4-defective c3h/hej diabetic mouse, arguing that the dramatic  increase in colonization seen in c3h/hen diabetic mice may partially be due to diabetic-induced defects in innate immunity. competition experiments demonstrated that e. coli had a significant advantage over k. pneumoniae in the bladders of healthy mice and less of an advantage in diabetic bladders. in the kidneys, k. pneumoniae outcompeted e. coli in healthy mice but in diabetic mice e. coli outcompeted k. pneumoniae and caused severe pyelonephritis. diabetic kidneys contained renal tubules laden with communities of e. coli uti89 bacteria within an extracellular-matrix material. diabetic mice also had glucosuria, which may enhance bacterial replication in the urinary tract. these data support that this  murine diabetic uti model is consistent with known characteristics of human diabetic uti and can provide a powerful tool for dissecting this infection in the multifactorial setting of diabetes.

TI  == a novel transposon, tn6009, composed of a tn916 element linked with a staphylococcus aureus mer operon.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize a novel conjugative transposon tn6009 composed of a tn916 linked to a staphylococcus aureus mer operon in representative gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated in nigeria and portugal. methods: eighty-three gram-positive and 34 gram-negative bacteria were screened for the presence of the tn6009 using dna-dna hybridization, pcr, hybridization of pcr products, sequencing and mating experiments by established procedures. results: forty-three oral and 23 urine gram-negative and gram-positive isolates carried the tn6009. sequencing was performed to verify the direct linkage between the mer resistance genes and the tet(m) gene. a nigerian klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from a urinary tract infection patient, and one commensal isolate from each of the other tn6009-positive genera, serratia liquefaciens, pseudomonas sp., enterococcus sp.  and streptococcus sp. isolated from the oral and urine samples of healthy portuguese children, were able to act as donors and conjugally transfer the tn6009 to the enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 recipient, resulting in tetracycline- and mercury-resistant e. faecalis transconjugants. conclusions: this study reports a novel non-composite conjugative transposon tn6009 containing a tn916 element linked to an s. aureus mer operon carrying genes coding for inorganic mercury resistance (mera), an organic mercury resistance (merb), a regulatory protein (merr) and a mercury transporter (mert). this transposon was identified in 66 isolates from two gram-positive and three gram-negative genera and is the first transposon in the tn916 family to carry the gram-positive mer genes directly linked to the tet(m) gene.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == surveillance study in europe and brazil on clinical aspects and antimicrobial resistance epidemiology in females with cystitis (aresc): implications for empiric therapy.
AB  == background: uncomplicated cystitis in females is among the most frequent infections in community. objective: to determine clinical aspects, epidemiology,  and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. intervention: patients were investigated clinically and with urinalysis and urine culture. measurements: this survey started in 2003 and ended in 2006 including 68 centres in nine european countries and in brazil. female patients between 18 and 65 yr with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and clinically evaluated. uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility tested for nine antimicrobials. results and limitations: clinical data of 4264 eligible patients  were analysed. a positive urine culture was found in 74.6%. within the 3018 pathogens, escherichia coli (e. coli) was most frequent (76.7%), followed by enterococcus faecalis (4.0%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (3.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%), and proteus mirabilis (3.5%). e. coli showed the highest rate  of susceptibility to fosfomycin (98.1%) followed by mecillinam (95.8%), nitrofurantoin (95.2%), and ciprofloxacin (91.8%). the lowest rate was found for  ampicillin (45.1%). for the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (96.4%), mecillinam (95.9%), ciprofloxacin (90.3%), and nitrofurantoin (87.0%). in all countries a susceptibility rate to e. coli above 90% was found only for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. the susceptibility rates varied significantly from country to country (p<0.0001), except for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. conclusions: despite wide cross-country variability of bacterial susceptibility/resistance rates to the other antimicrobials tested, fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin have preserved  their in vitro activity in all countries investigated. they may represent good options for the empiric therapy of female patients with uncomplicated cystitis.

TI  == the establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == the incidence of infectious diseases after renal transplantation: a single-centre experience.
AB  == this single-centre study was designed to investigate the incidence of infections  and their causative pathogens during the first three months after renal transplantation (rtx) in patients who had undergone the procedure in 2005 (n=174). we compared this group of patients with a previous one (1998-2000, n=437). in 2005, infection was diagnosed in 82 patients (47%). symptomatic lower  urinary tract infection (uti) was present in 43 patients (25%), pyelonephritis in 15 (8.6%), and urosepsis in 7 (4%). wound infection developed in 21 patients (12%), cytomegalovirus (cmv) disease in 15 (8.6%), and pneumonia in 5 (3%). the most frequent pathogens in uti were klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. pathogens of wound infection included staphylococcus coagulase negative and k. pneumoniae. pneumonia was frequently caused by mycoplasma pneumophila. compared with the previous group, we noted decreases in the total number of infections (77.7 vs. 47%, p<0.001), pneumonia (8.5 vs. 3%, p<0.02) and uti (33.3  vs. 24.7%, p<0.05). we observed an increased incidence of multiresistant klebsiella. based on these results, we have changed our scheme of antibiotic prophylaxis and the algorithms of antibiotic treatment. we reduced the use of antibiotics with an adverse epidemiological effect (quinolones, third-generation  cephalosporins) and increased the use of relatively safe antibiotics (penicillins, aminopenicillins, with and without beta-lactam inhibitors).

TI  == [epidemiology and treatment of acute prostatitis after prostatic biopsy].
AB  == objective: acute prostatitis is the main complication of prostatic biopsies (pb)  and sometimes requires hospitalisation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. this study evaluated the pathogens responsible and proposes a statistically adapted empirical antibiotic therapy. patients and methods: this retrospective (from 2000 to 2006) two-centre study included 17 patients hospitalised for acute prostatitis after pb in a series of 1,216 biopsies. bacteriological documentation was based on urine cultures, blood cultures, identification of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility testing. results: all patients received prophylactic antibiotics with a single dose of systemic fluoroquinolone at least 1 h before pb. bacterial  identification was possible in fourteen cases: e. coli (nine cases), proteus mirabilis (one case), klebsiella pneumoniae (one case), enterococcus faecalis (one case), staphylococcus spp (one case), clostridium perfringens (one case). only urine culture was positive in 6 cases (35%), only blood culture was positive in 3 cases (17%), and urine cultures and blood cultures were positive and concordant in 5 cases (29%). a high rate of resistance of e. coli to fluoroquinolones was observed in 88% of cases and to cotrimoxazole in 77% of cases. however, the strain was susceptible to second and third generation cephalosporins (2gc and 3gc) and amikacin in 100% of cases. prostatitis was associated with epididymo-orchitis (3 cases), acute urinary retention (4 cases) and infective endocarditis (1 case). conclusions: identification of the micro-organism responsible for acute prostatitis after biopsy requires a combination of blood cultures and urine cultures. empirical antibiotic therapy is based on the use of 2gc or 3gc, alone or in combination with amikacin depending on the severity of the clinical features.

AB  == antimicrobial dressings such as those containing silver are now being used widely to control wound bioburden, and tests to demonstrate their efficacy predominantly involve in vitro models using free-living or planktonic bacteria. in this present study a wide range of antibiotic-sensitive and resistant bacteria were tested in  their quasi-sessile state using a standard agar assay and a second method used a  poloxamer gel (true biofilm state - poloxamer encourages microorganisms to exhibit a more clinically relevant biofilm phenotype) technique. the antimicrobial activity of two silver dressings, a silver-containing hydrofiber (sch) dressing and a nanocrystalline silver-containing dressing (ncs), were evaluated on a variety of microorganisms, using a zone-of-inhibition (zoi) test.  when grown on agar (presenting a quasi-sessile state of each organism), the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms were generally more susceptible to the sch  dressing compared with the ncs. zois associated with sch dressing ranged between  5.7 and 17.5 mm; those for the ncs against the same group of organisms ranged between 1.9 and 8.6 mm. when grown on poloxamer gel, (presenting the biofilm state of each organism) the same group of microorganisms were less susceptible to both dressings. the sch dressing was most effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus (zoi range: 2.6-6 mm); the ncs was most effective against strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli (i.e. zoi range: 1-2.8 mm). similarly  to the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms, nine of ten antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains when grown on agar were more susceptible to the sch dressing compared with the ncs. although the microorganisms tested were universally less susceptible to the silver dressings when in their biofilm state, in the majority  of cases, the sch dressing demonstrated greater biofilm-inhibiting activity than  the ncs.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  == background: ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an n-phosphono prodrug. we investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. methods: mics were determined by clsi agar dilution, but with varied inocula. mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. results: mics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 0.5-2 mg/l, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/l, respectively. even with 2% nacl added, all mrsa were susceptible at 2 mg/l. mics for enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/l; e. faecium was resistant. mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., morganella morganii and proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/l versus 0.12-1 mg/l for enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter  spp. and 2-8 mg/l for acinetobacter spp. mics rose to 1-2 mg/l for many enterobacteriaceae with classical tem beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), hyperproduced ampc or k1 enzymes. mics for strains with classical tem/shv beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with esbls. resistance due to class a beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. geometric mean mics were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised mics for beta-lactamase-positive moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. ceftaroline selected ampc-derepressed enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected esbl variants of blatem in e. coli. resistance selection was not seen with s. aureus, h. influenzae or pneumococci. conclusions: ceftaroline has impressive anti-mrsa and anti-pneumococcal activity. slight lability to classical tem and shv beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible  with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by esbls. resistance selection occurred with enterobacteriaceae, not mrsa.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. the  antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. the honey  samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution.  most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of s. aureus even at 50% dilution. undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of staphylococcus uberis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. no inhibition of micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. the diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. this observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.

TI  == urinary tract infections in brescia, italy: etiology of uropathogens and antimicrobial resistance of common uropathogens.
AB  == background: urinary tract infections are associated with substantial morbidity and recurrent infections. antibiotic therapy is generally initiated empirically because early treatment decreases the rate of morbidity resulting from uti. unfortunately, antibiotic resistance has become an increasingly pressing problem  in many countries. in this study, the resistance patterns of urinary isolates to  commonly used antimicrobials were determined in order to evaluate the options for empirical antibiotic therapy of uti in out- and in- patients. material/methods: a retrospective study was carried out on urine samples examined in this laboratory  in 2002-2005. the isolates were divided into the following three groups: isolates from hospital inpatients, isolates from community outpatients, and isolates from  catheterized patients. results: escherichia coli was the most common etiologic agent isolated, followed by enterococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae. over the four-year period, a decrease in the isolation of pseudomonas aeruginosa and a parallel increase in candida spp. in hospitalized patients were observed. against gram-positive isolates, enterococci in particular, ampicillin and glycopeptides demonstrated the best, most consistent activity. among escherichia coli isolates, nitrofurantoin, cephalosporins, and penicillin/betalactams were the best options  for therapeutic treatment because of the presence of a rate of resistance to cotrimoxazole and fluoroquinolones of over 10%, while the most active drug against pseudomonas aeruginosa was piperacillin/tazobactam. conclusions: region-specific surveillance studies provide additional information about the type of pathogens causing utis and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. therefore, these data can serve as a basis to develop national country-specific guidelines for the empirical treatment of utis.

TI  == frequency of urinary tract infection in pediatric liver transplantation candidates.
AB  == an increased frequency of infections has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease. the tendency of patients in this population to acquire uti is not  completely understood. we aimed at investigating the incidence of uti in children with cirrhosis, before liver transplantation. twenty-six children (9 girls, 17 boys; mean age, 7.66 +/- 5.73 yr) with chronic liver disease who had undergone liver transplantation between 2002 and 2004 were included. on admission for liver transplantation, patients were examined for presence of uti. serum biochemistry,  complete blood cell count, urinalysis and culture, glomerular filtration rate, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed prior to liver transplantation. ten  of 26 patients (38.5%) were found to have symptomatic uti. urine cultures revealed e. coli in five (50%), klebsiella pneumoniae in three (30%), enterococcus faecalis in one (10%), and enterobacter aeruginosa in one (10%) patient(s), respectively, as etiologic factors. the etiologies of chronic liver disease in our patients with uti were ba in five, pfic in three, wilson's disease in one, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in one patient. we found a significantly greater number of utis in patients with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia (p < 0.05). the mean age of the patients with uti was 2.75 +/- 3.49 yr, which was significantly lower than in those without uti (9.75 +/- 4.86 yr, p < 0.05). levels for white blood cells, thrombocytes, alt, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in patients with uti than in those without uti. there were no significant differences between the groups with  regard to serum albumin, bilirubin, ast, ggt, bun, or creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate, duration of disease, and peld scores. in patients with bacteriuria, renal usg revealed normal findings in all, but except one patient who had pelvicalyceal dilatation. scintigraphic findings demonstrated acute pyelonephritis in six (60%) patients with uti. vcug demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in two patients. in conclusion, symptomatic uti is common in children with cirrhosis. it occurs more frequently in patients with biliary atresia than it does in patients with other types of chronic liver disease. in febrile children with chronic liver disease, uti should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == antibacterial effect of autologous platelet gel enriched with growth factors and  other active substances: an in vitro study.
AB  == platelet-rich plasma is a new inductive therapy which is being increasingly used  for the treatment of the complications of bone healing, such as infection and nonunion. the activator for platelet-rich plasma is a mixture of thrombin and calcium chloride which produces a platelet-rich gel. we analysed the antibacterial effect of platelet-rich gel in vitro by using the platelet-rich plasma samples of 20 volunteers. in vitro laboratory susceptibility to platelet-rich gel was determined by the kirby-bauer disc-diffusion method. baseline antimicrobial activity was assessed by measuring the zones of inhibition on agar plates coated with selected bacterial strains. zones of inhibition produced by platelet-rich gel ranged between 6 mm and 24 mm (mean 9.83 mm) in diameter. platelet-rich gel inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus and was also active against escherichia coli. there was no activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. moreover, platelet-rich gel seemed to induce the in vitro growth of ps. aeruginosa, suggesting that it may cause an exacerbation of infections with this organism. we believe that a combination of the inductive and antimicrobial properties of platelet-rich gel can improve the treatment of infected delayed healing and nonunion.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == high risk of bacterobilia in advanced experimental chronic fasciolosis.
AB  == fasciolosis is recognized as an important human disease. wistar rats experimentally infected with fasciola hepatica were examined using data obtained  in the advanced chronic state of the disease (200, 300 and 400 days post-infection, dpi). pigment stones (ps) and bile specimens were collected. the  same procedure was applied in control rats. liver tests were determined using stored serum samples. bacteriological bile culture revealed viable bacteria (escherichia coli, 45% of cases, enterococcus faecalis, 45% and klebsiella pneumoniae, 10%). the presence of bacterobilia was associated with liver serum enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (ast or sgot), alanine aminotransferase (alt or sgpt), alkaline phosphatase (ap) and total bilirubin levels. multivariate analysis suggested an association between bacterobilia and the following factors: duration of parasitic infection and intensity of parasitic infection supported the impression that the obstruction caused by advanced chronic fasciolosis in the rat may be related to biliary sepsis. extrapolation to human infection in fasciolosis hyperendemic areas is discussed. in conclusion, the results of the rodent model should lead to a reconsideration of treatment features in human disease, i.e. therapeutic strategies should not only include a  parasitic treatment but also consider the possibility of bacterial co-infection.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == characterization of the microbial flora in disinfecting footbaths with hypochlorite.
AB  == change or disinfection of footwear are measures to prevent cross contamination between areas with low and high hygienic levels in the food industry. the efficacy of disinfecting footwear is not well documented. samples of used disinfectant and from swabbing of corners after draining were taken from disinfecting footbaths containing chlorine in four norwegian cheese factories. bacteria were present in 9 of 12 footbaths and more positive samples were found from swab samples than from used disinfectant. the microbial flora in footbaths varied between the dairies. in two dairies, the flora was dominated by pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp., respectively. in the third dairy, both bacillus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were present and in the fourth dairy, the flora was diverse (acinetobacter sp., enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacillus sp.). the strains were not resistant to the recommended  user concentration of chlorine in bactericidal suspension or surface tests. the degree of attachment to plastic varied between strains and species and bacteria attached to surfaces were in general more resistant than suspended bacteria. the  results of the survey indicated that disinfecting footbaths containing chlorine may act as contamination sources in food factories and should not be used without regular hygienic monitoring.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == [antibiotic-resistance in italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project ar-iss].
AB  == the antibiotic resistance surveillance project ar-iss, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country.  the laboratories collect and transmit data to the istituto superiore di sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis/faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed escherichia coli. they also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study earss-italia and from other european countries. oxacillin resistance in s. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in europe (41,5%). no strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. in s. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several european countries. unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in e. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in europe. presumptive esbl production in gram-negative organisms can be  estimated at 20% in klebsiella and 1% in e. coli. ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in europe. in conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. although some activities of ar-iss  need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and  representative data about antibiotic resistance in italy that can be used for comparison at the european level.

TI  == antibiofilm activity of glmu enzyme inhibitors against catheter-associated uropathogens.
AB  == the colonization of uropathogenic bacteria on urinary catheters resulting in biofilm formation frequently leads to the infection of surrounding tissue and often requires removal of the catheter. infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat since they may be more than 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. we have developed an antibiofilm  composition comprising an n-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase (glmu) inhibitor and protamine sulfate, a cationic polypeptide. the antibiofilm activity of glmu inhibitors, such as iodoacetamide (ida), n-ethyl maleimide (nem), and nem analogs, including n-phenyl maleimide, n,n'-(1,2-phenylene)dimaleimide (opdm), and n-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (pyrm), was tested against that of catheter-associated uropathogens. both ida and nem inhibited biofilm formation in escherichia coli. all nem analogs showed antibiofilm activity against clinical isolates of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis. the combination of opdm with protamine sulfate (ps) enhanced its antibiofilm activity and reduced its effective concentration to as low as 12.5 microm. in addition, we found that the in vitro inhibitory activity of opdm-plus-ps-coated silicone catheters against p. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis colonization was superior to that of catheters coated with silver hydrogel. confocal scanning laser microscopy further confirmed that the opdm-plus-ps-coated silicone catheters were almost free from bacterial colonization. thus, a broad-spectrum antibiofilm composition comprising a glmu inhibitor and protamine  sulfate shows promise for use in anti-infective coatings for medical devices, including urinary catheters.

TI  == predominance of gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  == background and purpose: while nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of  empirical therapy. this study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (nbsis)  surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. methods: during the period from 1996 to 2003 at national cheng kung university hospital, patients with nbsis were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. results: from 1996 to 2003, there were  4,038 episodes of nbsis. the overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. aerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of nbsis, respectively. the 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of nbsis), staphylococcus aureus (13%), candida spp. (10%), acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and escherichia coli (8%). oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of s. aureus isolates. in contrast to enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. the emerging antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant a. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli. despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. conclusions: in summary, gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing nbsis and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. surveillance of the characteristics of nbsis and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.

AB  == the use of harvested rainwater in domestic hot water systems can result in optimised environmental and economic benefits to urban water cycle management, however, the water quality and health risks of such a scenario have not been adequately investigated. thermal inactivation analyses were carried out on eight  species of non-spore-forming bacteria in a water medium at temperatures relevant  to domestic hot water systems (55-65 degrees c), and susceptibilities to heat stress were compared using d-values. the d-value was defined as the time required to reduce a bacterial population by 90% or 1 log reduction. the results found that both tested strains of enterococcus faecalis were the most heat resistant of the bacteria studied, followed by the pathogens shigella sonnei biotype a and escherichia coli o157:h7, and the non-pathogenic e. coli o3:h6. pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to be less resistant to heat, while salmonella typhimurium,  serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and aeromonas hydrophila displayed minimal heat resistance capacities. at 65 degrees c, little thermal resistance was demonstrated by any species, with log reductions in concentration occurring within seconds. the results of this study suggested that the temperature range from 55 to 65 degrees c was critical for effective elimination of enteric/pathogenic bacterial components and supported the thesis that hot water systems should operate at a minimum of 60 degrees c.

AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == changing face of septicaemia and increasing drug resistance in blood isolates.
AB  == in a retrospective study conducted between january, 2000 and december 2000, 7157  adults and children were studied. amongst these, 1071 patients had positive blood cultures. of these, 575 (53.6%) cases were community acquired septicaemia and 486 (46.4%) cases had developed septicaemia of nosocomial origin. gram negative aerobes accounted for 708 (66.1%) isolates. amongst them, klebsiella pneumoniae predominated (23%), followed by escherichia coli (14%). acinetobacter spp. emerged as the next common pathogen (9%), followed by salmonella typhi (5.4%). staphylococcus aureus (9%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (9%) were the most common gram positive isolates followed by enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). antibiotic susceptibility of all these isolates was performed by the modified stokes' method. both klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli showed alarmingly high resistance to all groups of antibiotics with 70-80% resistance to amoxicillin and cephalexin. minimum resistance was observed against cefotaxime (23%) and ciprofloxacin (12%). majority of enterococcus faecalis were multidrug resistant. streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited 26% resistance to penicillin. thus, the study clearly highlights the rising level of drug resistance amongst the bacterial isolates from blood and hence the need to update and formulate newer drug policies.

TI  == correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  == bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. this differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure  of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. the objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. a literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (icus): staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, acetinobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. to determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in icus, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. all clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory dna fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. a diversity index for each species was calculated as the number  of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. the correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. they showed median survival times between 1.5 days (p. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (enterococcus faecium). during the prospective icu study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (e. coli) were found. a correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, p=0.024). environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in icus. infection control measures should consider this finding.

TI  == pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the south american bullfrog leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  == norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the south american bullfrog, leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. the primary structure of a  previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as gly-leu-leu-asp-thr-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asn-val-val-gly-ser-leu-ala-ser-lys-v al-met-glu-lys-leu.nh2. the second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the caribbean mountain chicken frog l. fallax. pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b) but potencies were relatively low (mic values in the range 25-200 microm). the peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (ld50>400 microm).

TI  == purple urine bag syndrome in a hemodialysis patient.
AB  == purple urine bag syndrome (pubs) is an uncommon disorder, in which the plastic disposable urinary catheter bag turns purple or blue following hours or days of urinary catheterization. the purple discoloration results from indirubin dissolved in the plastic mixing with indigo in the urine. bacteria possessing indoxyl sulfatase degrade indoxyl sulfate into indirubin and indigo. indoxyl sulfate is derived from the metabolism of tryptophan. pubs usually occurs in chronic catheterized elderly women who are constipated and poorly ambulant. the clinical course is benign and rarely causes sepsis. this investigation reports a  61-year-old female diabetic patient with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis, who had two episodes of blue or purple urine bag discoloration. the urine culture of the first episode yielded klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas that of the second episode yielded escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and proteus vulgaris. both episodes resolved following oral antibiotics treatment and placement of new foley catheters. to our knowledge, this is the first recorded case of pubs in a dialysis patient.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of contemporary pathogens from uncomplicated urinary tract infections isolated in a multicenter italian survey:  possible impact on guidelines.
AB  == during 2004 four italian laboratories assessed the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis in female out-patients. a total of 600 urine samples from individuals aged 18-65 were studied. the overall prevalence of escherichia coli was 85.3%. klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus saprophyticus, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and other rarer species were far less represented. determination of the  antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the entire collection of e. coli (512 organisms) revealed that among the drugs analyzed ampicillin was the least active molecule with only 62.5% of the strains being inhibited. amoxicillin-clavulanate  and cefuroxime displayed a higher potency (87.7% and 89.2% respectively). cotrimoxazole inhibited only 70.1% of the uropathogens. the three fluoquinolones  tested had comparable activity ranging from 83.0% for ciprofloxacin, to 83.6% for levofloxacin and 84.9% for prulifloxacin, indicating an identical spectrum of cross resistance. nitrofurantoin (96.7%) and fosfomycin (98.6%) were the most potent drugs. against the whole collection of uropathogens, only cefuroxime, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin overcame the threshold of 90% activity, with the fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin-clavulanate suffering from about 15% resistance. the results of this survey strongly support the conclusions of recent italian guidelines concerning the best empiric treatment of uti in this country today.

AB  == in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee  for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and  an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == suaveolindole, a new mass-limited antibacterial indolosesquiterpene from greenwayodendron suaveolens obtained via high-throughput natural products chemistry methods.
AB  == utilizing high-throughput isolation, purification, and analysis methods applied to a natural products library, a new mass-limited antibacterial indolosesquiterpene, suaveolindole (1), was obtained from greenwayodendron suaveolens. the miniaturization of the structure elucidation of 1 was performed primarily using the capnmr probe. compound 1 was found to possess significant in  vitro antibacterial activity against the gram-positive bacteria bacillus subtilis (atcc 43223), staphylococcus aureus (attc 6538p), and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (attc 33591), with mic values of 4, 8, and 8 microg/ml, respectively.

TI  == influence of various criteria for elimination of duplicates when calculating the  prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms associated with urinary infections.
AB  == the effect of applying various criteria for elimination of repeated isolates in the same patient on the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms frequently associated with urinary infections were analyzed. when  time criteria were applied, there was a decrease in the number of isolates of 13.4-27.5%, whereas when variations in antibiotic susceptibility were considered, between 4.3 and 20.3% of the isolates were eliminated. the absolute number of isolates varied considerably depending on which of these two criteria were used,  but neither criterion was seen to modify significantly the antibiotic susceptibility of these microorganisms and this confirms the recommendations of the nccls for this group of pathogens.

AB  == the effect of entry delayed blood culture bottles until the start of incubation for mechanical detection of organism were compared using 2 major blood culture systems; bactec 9240 system and bact/alert 3d system. total of 13 bacterial strains; 5 gram-positive cocci, 7 gram-negative bacilli and candida parapsilosis  which were isolated mainly from blood cultures were used as the test strains. bactec 92f, 93f and bact/alert fa, fn bottles were used as the blood culture bottles. all the bottles inoculated with the test strains were incubated and evaluated immediately after standing at room temperature for 24, 42, 48, 54 or 72 hours, using the respective automated blood culture systems. all the bottles were subcultured. the effect of entry delay the blood culture bottles for the mechanical detection was observed in many gram-negative organisms in bactec 9240  system. the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 4 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the bactec 92f bottles inoculated with escherichia coli. in serratia marcescens, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the bactec 92f bottles. in klebsiella pneumoniae, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 9 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. in enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5-6 of the 10 samples on  delaying for 42 hours. on the other hand, the blood cultures were evaluated to be positive in most of the samples of acinetobacter calcoaceticus (except 3 of the 10 samples which were evaluated not to be positive) on delaying for 42 hours in bact/alert 3 d system. the samples except part of streptococcus spp. were detected by subculture in both the bottles. these results indicate that the delayed time of blood culture bottles before inoculation with the test bacterial  samples affects the positive detection of blood cultures markedly in the blood culture system. therefore, the immediate incubation was considered to be necessary.

TI  == high-resolution visualization of the microbial glycocalyx with low-voltage scanning electron microscopy: dependence on cationic dyes.
AB  == the microbial glycocalyx is composed of a variety of polyanionic exopolysaccharides and plays important roles in microbial attachment to different substrata and to other cells. here we report the successful use of low-voltage scanning electron microscopy (lvsem) to visualize the glycocalyx in two microbial models (klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis biofilms) at high resolution, and also the dependence on fixation containing polycationic dyes for  its visualization. fixation in a paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde cocktail without cationic dyes was inadequate for visualizing the glycocalyx, whereas addition of  various dyes (alcian blue, safranin, and ruthenium red) to the aldehyde cocktail  appeared necessary for stabilization. the cationic dyes varied in size, shape, and charge density, and these factors appeared responsible for different phenotypic appearances of the glycocalyx with each dye. these results suggest that aldehyde fixation with cationic dyes for high-resolution lvsem will be a useful tool for investigation of microbial biofilms as well as investigation of the extent and role of the glycocalyx in microbial attachment to surfaces.

TI  == optimization of bacteriocin production by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  == the cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin st13br, produced by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, inhibits the growth of l. casei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. based on tricine-sds-page, bacteriocin st13br is 10 kda in size. complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after  treatment with proteinase k, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. low bacteriocin activity (200 au/ml) was recorded in bhi medium, m17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 au/ml) was recorded after 23 h in mrs broth, but only at 30 degrees c. tween 80 in mrs broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in mrs broth, stimulated bacteriocin  production (6,400 au/ml). only 50% activity (3,200 au/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 au/ml. bacteriocin production was not stimulated  by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 au/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 au/ml). activity levels less than  200 au/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 au/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. the presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher kh(2)po(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the united states in 2002.
AB  == background: bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. methods: from january to december of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa by 268 laboratories. susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), escherichia coli (7.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. in vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (99.8%), e. coli (97.3%), k. pneumoniae (93.3%),  and streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for k. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), e. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), e. faecalis (52.1%), and e. faecium (11.3%). combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or  both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range,  74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). conclusion: ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.

AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. methods: in 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group b isolates (82% resistant). nine  percent of s. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l), but none required >/=2 mg/l for inhibition. high-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin mics (>/=32 mg/l), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of enterococcus faecium. vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of e. faecium, 3% of e. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, mic of 8 mg/l). escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of e. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of klebsiella spp. and 8% of enterobacter spp. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in gram-positive organisms. ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. mics of tigecycline were low for gram-positive species and enterobacteriaceae except proteeae and enterobacter spp. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. an important exception was oxacillin resistance in s. aureus.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

AB  == in an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters (up to 36 h). plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by hplc with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (ubt) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. the mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. the mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. the ubts, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an escherichia coli atcc reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following mics (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, mhb): e. coli atcc 25922 (0.008/0.008); e. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016);  proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and s. saprophyticus ho94 (0.125/0.25). the median ubts measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains including p. aeruginosa and between 1:8  and 1:>or=1024 for the five gram-positive strains. the median ubts for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains (incl p. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five gram-positive strains. the ubts up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (p<0.05 ) for both e. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against klebsiella,  proteus and pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all gram-positive strains. for the ubts at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the proteus and  pseudomonas strains. the areas under the ubt-time-curve (aubt) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (p ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for p. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually  gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated uti  performed previously [int. j. antimicrob. agents (2004)].

AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == microbial flora in ileal and colonic neobladders.
AB  == objective: to describe bacterial colonization in patients with ileal and colonic  neobladders. methods: twenty-three patients with right colon neobladders, 30 with ileal neobladders, 11 who had undergone radical prostatectomy, and 6 healthy controls were included. culture of clean-catch, midstream urine specimens was done weekly for 3 weeks, and this was repeated after 6 months. residual urine was measured, and the patients were interviewed about leakage. all patients and controls were antibiotic free during the study except for 13 of the ileal neobladder patients, who were treated with trimethoprim 100mg daily. results: urine cultures from controls and prostatectomy patients were negative for bacteria, whereas 67% of the specimens from patients with neobladders, not on antibiotic therapy, were culture positive, and half of these contained uropathogenic species, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. bacterial colonization (including uropathogenic strains) was strongly correlated with residual urine (p<0.005), but not with leakage. anaerobic strains were found more frequently (p=0.04) in urine from ileal neobladders than in urine from colonic neobladders.  the 13 patients with ileal neobladders and on prophylactic antibiotic therapy carried bacteriuria in 80% of the samples, the majority being anaerobic strains.  uropathogenic strains, mainly enterecoccus faecalis was revealed in 30% of the samples. conclusions: the lower urinary tract of patients with ileal or colonic neobladders is heavily colonized with potentially uropathogenic and anaerobic bacteria. complete bladder emptying reduces the bacterial burden. anaerobic colonization is increased in neobladders reconstructed from ileum. prophylactic antibiotic therapy does not seem to reduce the bacterial burden, but interferes with the bacterial composition.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of september and december 2001. then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. the number of them were 496 strains. the  breakdown of these strains was gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and gram-negative  bacteria as 70.4%. susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (vcm) showed a strong  activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against mrsa in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/ml. in addition, arbekacin (abk) showed strong activity with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against mrsa and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/ml. abk also showed a strong activity against staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/ml. ampicillin (abpc) and cefozopran (czop) showed a relatively strong  activity against s. epidermidis (mic90: 8 micrograms/ml). abpc, imipenem (ipm), and vcm showed strong activities against enterococcus faecalis. no increase of low-susceptible strains in e. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. against escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (mepm) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/ml; ipm prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/ml. czop and cefotiam (ctm) also showed strong activities against e. coli: mic90 of czop was within 0.125 microgram/ml; mic90 of ctm was within 0.5 microgram/ml. quinolone-resistant e. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. mepm showed the strongest activity against citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/ml. almost all drugs showed strong activities against klebsiella  pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, and mepm prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. against serratia marcescens, the mic90 of gentamicin (gm) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and those of ipm and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs  were not so active. the mic90 of gm was 8 micrograms/ml, those of ipm and amikacin were 16 micrograms/ml, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/ml.

TI  == intestinal microflora in early infancy: composition and development.
AB  == the neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. this enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media.  the limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. the establishment of the gut microbial  population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. the climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. the foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. the maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. the bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. after the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. in full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces  the development of a flora rich in bifidobacterium spp. other obligate anaerobes, such as clostridium spp. and bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also  enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. during the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to  bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a "bifidus flora" is unusual. in other studies the presence of a consistent number  of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. the predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. according to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. in these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of  bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. in extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. the gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified. according to the few studies so far performed, the predominant species are enterococcus faecalis, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. hygienic conditions and antimicrobial procedures strongly influence the intestinal colonization pattern.

TI  == leitbakteria of microbial biofilm communities causing occlusion of biliary stents.
AB  == biliary stents inserted to relieve obstructive jaundice caused by biliary or pancreatic malignancies inevitably become occluded by microbial growth in the form of diverse microbial community biofilms. the scarce information available on these communities is based on cultivation methods, but such methods usually provide distorted overviews of community composition, so commonalities and differences in biliary stent communities are uncertain. we extracted dna and rna  from the microbial communities of 11 biliary stents explanted from nine patients  in hospitals from two different countries, amplified 16s rrna and rdna sequences, analysed the amplicons by the single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) method, and sequenced and deduced phylogenetic assignments of the major amplicons representing the major biofilm community members. we used a modified robbins device (mrd) to study de novo development of a stent biofilm from a patient stent microbial community. single-strand conformation polymorphism fingerprinting revealed the same six abundant bacterial species, here designated leitbakteria, namely klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and two unculturable bacteria distantly related to e. coli and shigella sonnei, in all of the stent biofilm communities. in the experimental biliary stent system, a sequential colonization of the stent surface was observed, with p. aeruginosa being the pioneer colonizer, followed by k. pneumoniae and one of the unculturable leitbakteria, followed by the remainder of the community. the overview of microbial biofilm communities of biliary stents gained by the use of culture-independent methods revealed new unculturable bacteria as major members of biliary stent biofilms, and the diversity of the abundant members of the stent biofilms is considerably lower than suggested from  earlier studies based on cultivation methods, and that communities from different stents from different patients in different countries are remarkably similar and  have similar major members, the stent leitbakteria.

TI  == a comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in burkina faso.
AB  == burkina faso is one of the subsaharan african nations. no national services for monitoring of antibiotic resistance are available, so the number of reports of resistance patterns among hospital pathogens are inconsistent. in order to evaluate antibiotic resistance, a total of 1998 valuable microrganisms were analysed during 2000 at the medical centre st. camille of ouagadougou, burkina faso's capital. they were isolated as follows: 1012 from urine-culture, 503 from  tonsil swabs, 398 from pus, 53 from sputum and 32 from blood-cultures. escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism from urine (44%); enterococcus faecalis from tonsil swabs (96.4%), staphylococcus aureus from pus (17%) and k. pneumoniae (70%) from sputum. in general, resistance to the old antibiotics, such as aminopenicillins and cotrimoxazole was shown. the most active antibiotic was norfloxacin, a rarely used antibiotic in this country. in conclusion, our study shows that it is necessary to create antibiotic-resistance  surveillance centers in the developing countries to adopt an accurate therapy to  avoid exporting of antibiotic resistance to the developed countries linked to increased emigration.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against recent clinical isolates of bacteria in korea.
AB  == gemifloxacin is an enhanced-affinity fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. in korea, resistant bacteria are relatively more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. in this study, we studied the in vitro activities of gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other commonly used antimicrobial agents against 1,689 bacterial strains isolated at four korean university hospitals during 1999-2000.  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the agar dilution  method of national committee for clinical laboratory standards. gemifloxacin had  the lowest mics for the respiratory pathogens: 90% of streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by 0.06, 0.03, and 0.03 mg/l, respectively. gemifloxacin was more active than the other fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis. the mic90s of gemifloxacin for klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, and non-typhoidal salmonella spp. were 0.25, 1.0, and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, while  those for other gram-negative bacilli were 4-64 mg/l. in conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active among the comparative agents against gram-positive species, including respiratory pathogens isolated in korea.

TI  == the antimicrobial properties of milkfat after partial hydrolysis by calf pregastric lipase.
AB  == studies on the kinetic characteristics of calf pregastric lipase (ec 3.1.1.3) have shown that it preferentially releases short chain fatty acids (scfas) from bovine milkfat. the released fatty acids form mixed micelle structures. the aim of this investigation has been to test whether hydrolysed milkfat is antimicrobial, and how the state of the emulsion alters the bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects. partial hydrolysis of milkfat by pregastric lipase was carried out in two types of emulsion systems, containing either triton x-100 or casein/lecithin, plus milkfat in citrate/phosphate buffer (ph 5.0-6.0). the concentrations and compositions of fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography. the minimum percentages of hydrolysed milkfat which affected growth and survival of selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were measured. the bacterial experiments were repeated using pure fatty acids at similar concentrations. lauric acid (c12:0) was found to be the most potent bactericidal fatty acid against enterococcae (gram-positive), and caprylic acid (c8:0) was the most potent against coliforms (gram-negative). use of triton x-100 for milkfat emulsification provided a more compatible medium for studying bacterial growth in the hydrolysed milkfat than did use of casein/lecithin. the results also show that the antimicrobial effects of individual fatty acids released from hydrolysed milkfat were at least additive and suggest that hydrolysis of milkfat may be a significant factor in controlling growth of organisms imbibed with food in pre-weaned animals. the amount of pregastric catalyzed triglyceride hydrolysis in the digestive tract is sufficient to produce an antibacterial concentration of fatty acids and monoglycerides.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction as a sensitive and rapid method for specific detection  of mycoplasma pneumoniae in clinical samples.
AB  == the fast diagnosis of mycoplasma primary atypical pneumonia is impaired by the lack of routinely available culture methods for isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from clinical specimens. likewise, serological methods commonly used for diagnosis are insensitive and non-specific. in this study, we have established and applied the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique to detect m. pneumoniae dna in clinical samples originating from the respiratory tract. the pcr results were compared with those from culture and serology tests. to standardize the detection of m. pneumoniae by pcr, we first used dna from culture grown organisms and clinical samples seeded with m. pneumoniae. pcr amplification was performed with m. pneumoniae-specific primers to amplify 144, 153 and 631 bp  dna fragments by using primer pairs mp5-1/mp5-2, p1-178/p1-331 and p1-178/p1-809, respectively. the amplification of the 631 bp dna fragment was found to be most sensitive for the detection of m. pneumoniae. using the most sensitive pcr, a total of 47 respiratory specimens from patients suspected of community acquired pneumonia were tested. while none of the specimens were positive for m. pneumoniae in culture, 6 specimens gave positive results by pcr. in 4 out of the  5 pcr positive samples tested serologically, the results were supported by elevated levels of anti-mycoplasma igg/igm/iga. thus, these results suggest that  pcr is the most sensitive method to detect m. pneumoniae in clinical specimens.

AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == in vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  == fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. the trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. we determined the mic and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (tem), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. all gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/l of carboxyfullerene, whereas gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/l carboxyfullerene. bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for gram-positive species, particularly for streptococcus pyogenes a-20, which was killed rapidly. intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by tem and anti-carboxyfullerene  binding assay. damage to the cell membrane in gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. these findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.

AB  == objective: to examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of foley catheters. materials and methods: in a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. the sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. the plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms  on the agar on the other side of the bridges. a collection of swarming, swimming  and nonmotile species were tested in the model. the relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage  of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. results: the swarmer cells of proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris migrated  successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. the migration index of serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. the mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). the swarmer cells of p. mirabilis  moved through populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections  of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. they were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of k. pneumoniae and s. aureus over the catheters. the migration index of p. mirabilis  swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of ps. aeruginosa and s. marcescens. conclusions: hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. with the exception of s. marcescens, the  incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and p. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. this suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == grazing rates of diverse morphotypes of bacterivorous ciliates feeding on four allochthonous bacteria.
AB  == aims: the permanence in aquatic systems of allochthonous bacteria coming from sewage effluents is a risk for public health. this work aimed to analyse the elimination of the bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae by a riverine ciliate community. methods and results: the ciliates were characterized and identified on the basis  of morphological and behavioural features and grouped in nine morphotypes. differential grazing by each morphotype on the four allochthonous bacteria was carried out by adding fluorescently labelled bacteria to the water samples, and measuring their uptake along time. conclusions: the nine morphotypes were present in all the samples but in different proportions, being the most abundant the small scuticociliates and hipotrichs. the smallest morphotypes showed grazing rates lower than 20 flb ciliate(-1) h(-1), with a preference towards k. pneumoniae. the larger morphotypes showed in general the highest grazing rates, but the selectivity was hardly attributable to bacterial size or type of cell wall. conclusions, significance and impact of the study: the elimination of allochthonous bacteria in an aquatic system may be highly different depending on  the diversity of the ciliated protistan community in the system and on the nature of the bacterial prey.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  == in a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (ubts) at intervals for up to 144 h. ofloxacin showed higher  concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. the median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug  administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. the ubts, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were  still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens  for which the mics of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: escherichia coli atcc 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively;  pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. generally, the ubts for  gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the ubts for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. according to the ubts, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (mics, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  == isolates from urine samples obtained during 1999 were identified and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents studied along with any production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) by escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. a total of 13774 samples were analysed using an automatic system for  the detection of bacterial atp (coral, usa). of these samples, 49% were reported  to be positive and uncontaminated; bacteria most frequently isolated were e. coli (47%), proteus mirabilis (7%), enterococcus faecalis (6%) and k. pneumoniae (5%). the susceptibility studies showed 37% e. coli strains resistant to amoxycillin+clavulanate 33% to cotrimoxazole and 22% to ciprofloxacin. seven strains of e. coli produced esbl. thirteen per cent of strains were resistant to  cefuroxime but only (1%) to fosfomycin. resistance to nitrofurantoin in k. pneumoniae was 38%. p. mirabilis showed 52% resistance to cotrimoxazole and 13% staphylococcus aureus, were methicillin-resistant. e. faecalis did not show any special resistance to normal medication. fosfomycin continued to show high activity against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterococci, some species of staphylococci and yeasts were difficult to treat empirically. esbl were detected  in the isolates of e. coli and there were some methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  == dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within duws. these methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. in order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. there are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. however, the food and drug administration have not approved all products currently on the market. our evaluation of zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use  and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. it is also economical  and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the duws was free from any viable microorganisms. this effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. the elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the duws  was performed. although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of duws following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. finally, the product can be  delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. from our study, zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. based on the research that  has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. a combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality  dental treatment water. independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ada, osap, and cdc guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. it is expected that  in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems  and products to deal with this issue. until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in duws.

AB  == a number of 7-substituted quinolone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. preliminary results indicated that most compounds tested in this study demonstrated better activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus than norfloxacin. among them, 1-(4-amino-2-fluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-[4-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-hydro xyiminoethyl]-1-piperazinyl]-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid (11d) and its ketone precursor 10d exhibited significant activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, erythromycin- and ampicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. due to strong cytotoxicities of 11d (a mean log gi(50) of  -5.40), compound 10d, with good antibacterial activities and low cytotoxicities (a mean log gi(50) of -4.67), is a more potential drug candidate.

TI  == urinary tract infections in general practice in a rural community in south trinidad.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was carried out at a general practice in south trinidad, to assess the sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates in this remote rural community. methods: quantitative bacteriologic cultures were performed according to standard procedures. identification of isolates was based on gram reaction, morphology and biochemical reactions. susceptibility testing was carried out using commonly prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. results: from 779 urine specimens, 49% were culture positive for counts >105 organisms per ml. three hundred and eighteen were aged 21 years and above and 85.5% of these were females. the lowest incidence of urinary tract  infections, 8%, was seen among the 13-20 year old age group. most males above 50  years had indwelling urethral catheters due to prostatic disease. escherichia coli was the predominant isolate, 71%, followed by proteus mirabilis, 9%, and klebsiella pneumoniae, 7%. all urinary tract infections isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin and >96% (except for citrobacter species, 63%) were sensitive to cefuroxime. apart from enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus saprophyticus, the overall sensitivity to ampicillin by all isolates was <33%. the prevalence of multi-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. all pseudomonas aeruginosa were fully sensitive to gentamicin and ofloxacin. conclusion: the high frequency of single and multiple antibiotic resistances in this rural community should cause alarm. the ease of procuring antibiotics in these areas without a prescription can result in uncontrolled self-medication. also, the absence of antibiotic prescribing policies and inadequate information on patterns of bacterial resistance, may all contribute to the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

AB  == 10 patients with posttraumatic bacterial meningitis were treated in the department of infectious diseases of the jagielloniam university--collegium medicum during the period of 63 months. traffic accidents were responsible for 80% of all cases of trauma. the most common place of injury was the base of anterior cranial fossa. infecting agent was established in 8 cases. gram-positive aerobic cocci (streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus  spp.) were found in 4 patients, gram-negative aerobic cocci (neisseria meningitidis) in 2 patients, and gram-negative aerobic rods (acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp, escherichia coli) in 3 patients. streptococcus pneumoniae was still highly sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus spp. were sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. neisseria meningitidis was sensitive to  penicillin, cefotaxime, amoxicillin/clavulonate. gram negative aerobic rods were  sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and aminoglycosides. among 10 patients treated for posttraumatic bacterial meningitis 1 patient died and in 1 preserved vegetative state was diagnosed. in 4 patients severe or moderate disabilities developed, however 4 recovered completely. 6 patients after regression of the cns infection were qualified to neurosurgical intervention. in  3 patients reconstructive operation of the basis of anterior cranial fossa with tissue glue beriplast p. was done, the recovery was complete. 3 patients didn't agree to surgical operation, and we don't know what has happened with them. they  have not come to the control visit.

TI  == [pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  == the bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by streptococcus faecalis (11%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and proteus mirabilis (6%). results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary  infections in children. fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. in hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. these treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == [identification of microbial subtypes from antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical laboratory for nosocomial infection surveillance].
AB  == we developed an algorism to identify microbial subtypes automatically from daily  antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical microbiology laboratory. the susceptibility pattern was expressed as a string of digits, each consisting of 0(resistant), 1(intermediate) or 2(susceptible) to respective antibiotics. any two patterns were regarded identical and combined if the difference at each digit never exceeds 1. the combined pattern was expressed as an array of digit-by-digit weighted averages of the two. the second combination was based on a degree of similarity among the numerical patterns using a formula, which was designed to emphasize differences in highly variable elements. this subgrouping procedure was done every three months. identity of the detected subtypes between the intervals  was determined using the same algorism as for the second combination. the algorism was applied to data of clinical isolates of mrsa, pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), enterococcus faecalis (ef), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), escherichia coli (ec) that were obtained over a period of 4 years. three major subtypes of mrsa, kp and ef were consistently detected with shifting mutual frequencies. most of ec isolates belonged to two consistent subtypes. although pa and sp had one or two consistent subtypes, there were multiple minor subtypes of varying frequencies. this analysis is regarded as an "infotyping", in contrast to serotype or genotype, of clinical microbial isolates, which is useful for nosocomial infection surveillance.

TI  == weissella confusa (basonym: lactobacillus confusus) bacteremia: a case report.
AB  == infection with lactobacillus is rare, and only a handful of species have been identified as being clinically significant: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus leichmannii. the literature contains one case report of bacteremia caused by weissella confusa (basonym: lactobacillus confusus), but  the clinical significance of the infection was unclear. we describe a case of w.  confusa bacteremia in a 46-year-old man with a history of abdominal aortic dissection and repair. this procedure was complicated by gut ischemia, which necessitated massive small bowel resection. he subsequently developed short-bowel syndrome, which required him to have total parenteral nutrition. he later developed an enterococcus faecalis aortic valve endocarditis that required a coronary artery bypass graft and aortic root replacement with homograft and 6 weeks of intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. three months prior to his most recent admission, he was diagnosed with klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia and candidemia. at the present admission, he had fever (t(max), 39.5 degrees c) and chills of 2 days' duration and was admitted to the intensive care unit because of hemodynamic instability. blood cultures grew k. pneumoniae and w. confusa in four of four blood culture bottles (both aerobe and anaerobe bottles). imaging studies failed to find any foci of infection. a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no vegetations. a culture of the patient's hickman catheter tip was negative. the patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and gentamicin. his condition improved, and he was discharged home, where he completed 4 weeks of piperacillin-tazobactam therapy. lactobacillemia seldom results in mortality; however, it may be a marker of a serious underlying disease. it is usually seen in patients who have a complex medical history or in patients who receive multiple antibiotics. lactobacillus spp. are generally associated with polymicrobial infections, and when isolated from the blood, they need to be considered possible pathogens. the presence of a vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive coccobacilli on a blood culture should alert clinicians to the possibility of bacteremia caused by w. confusa or other small gram-positive rods.

AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during the period from april 1997 to march 1998. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. a total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rate  of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic gram-positive bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated  from primary infections, followed by p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. we found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of s.  aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of enterococcus spp. the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of b. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: mystic antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (icus) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. the mystic (meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. the in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. the isolates consisted of 19 species of gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including k. pneumoniae (n=49), e. coli (n=48), a. baumannii (n=47), enterobacter spp. (n=41), and p. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including staphylococcus aureus (n=63), enterococcus faecalis (n=22), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n=21). all  isolates were collected from icu patients. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest mic(90) for all species tested. gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). carbapenems were the most  active drugs overall and only p. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). we also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) among all enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by etest/esbl strip. esbl production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). among them, klebsiella pneumoniae  was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and e. coli (14.6%). the high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of esbl production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.

AB  == two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, fa-ll-37 and cecropin p1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. both peptides inhibited escherichia coli at 25 microm (fa-ll-39), and 1.56 microm (cecropin p1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microm, and 25 microm), and klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microm, and 1.56 microm), but not  enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis. fa-ll-37 acted bacteriocidally against e. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two gram-negative organisms. cecropin p1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate lactobacillus fermentum b-54, which was susceptible to fa-ll-37 at 100 microm. the differential activities of these peptides toward gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. in addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.

AB  == background: the aim of the study was to evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated form urinocoltures. methods: 2192 bacterial strains obtained from urine cultures with bacterial count > 100,000 ufc/ml were examined in our laboratory from july through december 1996. inpatients as well as outpatients were considered. five different ward typologies were taken into account (surgery, medicine, obstetrics, spinal unit and high risk wards). isolation frequencies were evaluated for each ward, but in order to get an adequate statistical sample they were divided into in two categories, e.g. strains isolated from inpatients and from outpatients. antibiotic susceptibility  was also evaluated dividing the data into the same two categories. for strains isolated with lower frequencies that was not possible, and data from inpatients were grouped with data from outpatients. results: the results obtained show that  bacterial species most frequently isolated among inpatients are escherichia coli  (45.7%), enterococcus faecalis (16.8%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). those most frequently isolated among outpatients are escherichia coli (58.1%), enterococcus faecalis (12.3%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4.4%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (4.0%). as far as antibiotic susceptibility is concerned,  whenever a statistically significant difference in sensitivity could be observed  between strains isolated from inpatients and strains isolated from outpatients, sensitivity was always higher for outpatients strains. conclusions: isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility are different depending on the place of origin of the patients (inpatients/outpatients). this implies a different approach to the empiric therapy in urinary tract infections.

TI  == three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in argentina. the antimicrobial committee; and the national surveillance program (sir) participants group.
AB  == introduction: a national surveillance program (sir) was introduced in 1996 in argentina by the antimicrobial committee of the argentinean society for microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. the present study reports the rates  of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. methods: a 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., april-may and october-november) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 argentinean centers. susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: in all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), respectively. although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the s. aureus and cns strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. no ampicillin resistance  was displayed by enterococcus faecalis. high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). imipenem resistance in acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. among  enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the e. cloacae strains. resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli isolates, respectively. conclusions: the alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in argentina.

TI  == surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, 1998.
AB  == for the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. we re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the  most common isolates were enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among hospital-acquired infections, acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. the oxacillin resistance of s. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. among enterococcus spp., 85% were either e. faecalis or e. faecium. they were 14% resistant to vancomycin. among gram-negative bacteria, k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. this difference was less apparent in the case of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. these bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. fifty-one percent of salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. isolates from the east were least resistant. plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we  identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against s. aureus, ciprofloxacin against e. coli, and ciprofloxacin against salmonella spp. these findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.

TI  == structure-activity relationships of novel 2-substituted quinazoline antibacterial agents.
AB  == high-throughput screening of in-house compound libraries led to the discovery of  a novel antibacterial agent, compound 1 (mic: 12-25 microm against s. pyogenes).  in an effort to improve the activity of this active compound, a series of 2-substituted quinazolines was synthesized and evaluated in several antibacterial assays. one such compound (22) displayed improved broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial strains. this molecule also inhibited transcription/translation of bacterial rna, suggesting a mechanism for its antibiotic effects. structure-activity relationship studies of 22 led to the synthesis of another 24 compounds. although some of these molecules were found to be active in bacterial growth assays, none were as potent as 22. compound 22 was  tested for its ability to cure a systemic k. pneumonia infection in the mouse and displayed moderate effects compared with a control antibiotic, gentamycin.

TI  == the synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. part 1: modifications of ring-c and pro-drugs.
AB  == a series of analogues of, and potential pro-drugs derived from, the potent antibacterial diterpene totarol (1) were synthesized in order to elucidate the minimum structural requirements for antibacterial activity and to seek compounds  with good bioavailability in vivo. these analogues varied in the structural features of their aromatic rings and the prodrugs were o-glycosylated derivatives. they were tested in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa); and against the gram-negative multi-drug-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae. none of the analogues was more potent than totarol itself, which is effective against these gram-positive bacteria at mic values of 7 microm. the results were evaluated in terms of a structure-activity relationship and this showed that a phenolic moiety was essential for potent antibacterial activity. amongst the pro-drugs, totaryl alpha-d-mannopyranoside (22) proved the most active in vitro (mic 18 microm). the in vivo antibacterial activities of compounds 1, 22 and totarol beta-lactoside (23) were assessed in a mouse model of infection, but they were found to be ineffective. compounds 1 and 22 were shown to be cytotoxic towards proliferating  human cell cultures, ch 2983, hela, and mg 63, but only at concentrations of > 30 microm.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in key bloodstream bacterial isolates: electronic surveillance with the surveillance network database--usa.
AB  == to assess the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among the most common bloodstream isolates, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility data from the surveillance network database-usa, an electronic surveillance system that collects data from 118 clinical microbiology laboratories across the united states. between 1995 and 1997, resistance to both vancomycin and ampicillin was much more prevalent among enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis, suggesting the need for laboratories to identify to species. when staphylococcal  isolates were examined for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 microg/ml), the frequency was highest in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. we also learned that nonsusceptibility to ceftazidime in klebsiella pneumoniae was more prevalent among isolates from blood (12.7%) than among isolates from urine (7.1%) or respiratory sources (9.3%). although antimicrobial resistance is low overall for  isolates of escherichia coli from blood, the prevalence of cefoxitin resistance among ceftazidime-resistant strains (61.9%) suggests the action of mechanisms other than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.

TI  == comparison of sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women. sparfloxacin multicenter uncomplicated urinary tract infection study group.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is a common illness, with > or =30% of all women experiencing a uti during their lifetime. less than a decade ago, the standard therapy for acute uncomplicated utis involved treatment with > or =7 days of an antibacterial agent, but recent studies using a variety of newly introduced antibiotics, including the fluoroquinolones, have demonstrated that a 1- to 5-day treatment regimen can be equally effective. this randomized, double-masked, multicenter study was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a single dose of sparfloxacin with those of a 3-day regimen of sparfloxacin and a 7-day regimen of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of women with community-acquired  acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection. a total of 1175 women were enrolled; 395 received sparfloxacin as a single 400-mg dose on day 1, 394 received sparfloxacin as a 400-mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 200 mg once daily for  2 additional days, and 386 received ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily for 7 days.  patients were comparable with respect to demographic characteristics and underlying conditions. a total of 954 patients were clinically assessable; 490 of these were also bacteriologically assessable. all patients treated were included  in the tolerability analysis. escherichia coli (75.4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4.9%), enterococcus faecalis (4.6%), and staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.1%) were the most commonly isolated organisms. in the all-treated population, clinical success was achieved 5 to 9 days after therapy in 91.8%, 92.2%, and 91.6% of patients in the single-dose sparfloxacin, 3-day sparfloxacin, and 7-day  ciprofloxacin groups, respectively; bacteriologic success was observed in 91.7%,  92.6%, and 96.6% of those in the 3 groups. sustained clinical success rates 4 to  6 weeks after therapy were 76.6%, 80.2%, and 79.5% in the single-dose sparfloxacin, 3-day sparfloxacin, and 7-day ciprofloxacin groups, respectively; sustained bacteriologic success rates were 80.7%, 90.1%, and 92.6%. the most common adverse events were nausea, headache, vaginal thrush, dizziness, and diarrhea; >92% of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. the 2 drugs had comparable frequencies of adverse events, except for photosensitivity, which  occurred in 3.3% of the 3-day sparfloxacin group, 1.3% of the single-dose sparfloxacin group, and 0.3% of the ciprofloxacin group (p = 0.005). the 3-day sparfloxacin regimen was effective and well tolerated. the initial response to single-dose sparfloxacin treatment was comparable to the response to the other 2  regimens, but the single-dose regimen proved less effective over time, with higher rates of clinical recurrence and bacteriologic relapse. sparfloxacin provides an alternative to ciprofloxacin for patients with acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection who are not at risk for photosensitivity reactions or adverse events associated with a prolonged corrected qt interval.

TI  == bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (gpc), gram-negative  bacillary (gnb), and fungal blood-stream infections (bsis) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. study design: case series. methods: demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven bsis was analyzed. early-onset bsis were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset bsis as those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsis were treated with ampicillin and  gentamicin, and suspected late-onset bsis with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsis were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. gpc (83% due to group b streptococcus [gbs]) accounted for approximately one half of  early-onset bsi cases and gnb (68% enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. early-onset gbs declined from 24 to 11 cases (p=.04) and late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases (p<.01) from the first to the last study period. sixty-eight percent of late-onset bsis were due to gpc (primarily coagulase-negative staphylococcus), 18% to gnb, and 14% to fungus. over the study period, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and  gentamicin. although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn bsi cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 enterococcus faecalis isolates. all fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. conclusion: we observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset bsis due to gbs and an increase in late-onset bsis due to gpc, gnb, and fungi. the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset bsis and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset bsis has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.

TI  == stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  == aim: to serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. methods: stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. quantitative aerobic and anaerobic  cultures were performed. results: by day 30, predominant species were enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterbacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. in breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (se 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. on day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. conclusions: the gut of extremely low birthweight infants  is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.

AB  == the results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk  of the fetus intranatal infection. during the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. on the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin b, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. the s.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. when the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently  available antibiotics. because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.

AB  == cl 188,624, cl 190,294, and cl 191,121 are novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (thf)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems. the in vitro antibacterial activities of these thf carbapenems were evaluated and compared with those of biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem against 554 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers across north america. the antibacterial activities of the thf carbapenems were equivalent to that of biapenem, and the thf carbapenems  were slightly more active than imipenem and less active than meropenem against most of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae but lacked significant activity against pseudomonas isolates. in general, cl 191,121 was two- to fourfold more active than cl 188,624 and cl 190,294 against the staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates tested. cl 191,121 was twofold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and was as activity as imipenem against enterococcus faecalis isolates. biapenem and meropenem were two- and fourfold less active than cl 191,121, respectively, against the methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and e. faecalis. all the carbapenems displayed equivalent good activities against the streptococci. biapenem was slightly more active than the other carbapenems against bacteroides fragilis isolates. time-kill curve studies demonstrated that the thf carbapenems were bactericidal in 6 h against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus isolates.  the postantibiotic effect exerted by cl 191,121 was comparable to or slightly longer than that of imipenem against isolates of s. aureus, e. coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ofloxacin in urine for 4 days after a single oral dose of 400 mg].
AB  == antibacterial activity of ofloxacin in urine after a single oral dose of 400 mg was evaluated in ten healthy female volunteers. urine was collected over six periods, i.e., 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-48 h, 48-72 h, and 72-96 h postdose. ofloxacin levels were assayed in all samples using a microbiological method and hplc. urinary ofloxacin mics were determined for five bacterial strains recovered from urine, two e. coli strains of which one was susceptible and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (nal-a), one klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (nal-b), one staphylococcus saprophyticus strain, and one enterococcus faecalis strain; mics were 0.06, 0.25, 1, 0.25, and 2 mg/l, respectively. mean urinary ofloxacin levels by the microbiological method during  the six collection periods were 193.3 +/- 30.3, 138.1 +/- 31, 53.2 +/- 7.3, 8.3 +/- 0.8, 1.4 +/- 0.2, and 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/l, respectively. hplc provided similar results: 216.7 +/- 31.6, 130.7 +/- 20.5, 56.5 +/- 7.1, 8.3 +/- 0.9, 1.5 +/- 0.3,  and 0.5 +/- 0.05 mg/l, respectively. mean urinary ofloxacin excretion over 96 h was 67.4 +/- 3.6% of the dose by the microbiological method was 72.5 +/- 2.5% of  the dose by hplc. on the first day, bacteriostatic activity of urine against enterobacteria exceeded 32 and was greater than 8192 for the nalidixic acid-susceptible e. coli strain; on the next day, overall values were equal or greater than 8 for the nalidixic acid-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae strains. bacteriostatic activity was equal to or greater than 32 for the s. saprophyticus strain during the first two days and equal to 8 on the first day and 4 on the second day for the e. faecalis strain.

TI  == interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
AB  == the ability of the lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. a parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. although the initial deposition rates of the two candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.

TI  == in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam relative to other antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  == resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in many countries. accurate locally relevant information is essential for detection and control of emerging resistance and to facilitate choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in the immediate management of seriously ill patients. we have determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin/tazobactam for 97 strains of bacteria (55 enterobacteriaceae, 13 non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, 22 staphylococcus aureus, 6 enterococcus faecalis and 1 bacillus cereus) isolated from blood cultures and compared its activity to that of amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, cefotaxime. the strains were consecutive non-fastidious isolates with the following qualifications: coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were excluded and the number of staphylococcus aureus isolates was limited to 12 methicillin-resistant and 10 methicillin-sensitive strains. multiple isolates of the same species from individual patients were not included. the minimum inhibition concentrations of methicillin, penicillin, teichoplanin and vancomycin were also determined for specific groups of organisms. mics were determined by the etest method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) on mueller hinton agar. the mics of appropriate american type culture collection control strains were determined. based on the interpretative criteria of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (usa), 87 per cent of gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam compared with amoxycillin 26 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, co-amoxiclav 54 per cent, piperacillin 56 per cent, cefotaxime 69 per cent, ceftazidime 84 per cent, gentamicin 85 per cent and ciprofloxacin 91 per cent. of all isolates 75 per cent were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, compared with amoxycillin 22 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, piperacillin 41 per cent, co-amoxiclav 52 per cent, cefotaxime 59 per cent, ceftazidime 60 per cent, gentamicin 74 per cent and ciprofloxacin 77 per cent. two isolates (1 e. coli and 1 klebsiella pneumoniae) with antibiograms consistent with the relatively new resistance phenomenon of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were identified. the spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam for empirical antibiotic therapy is significantly greater than that of piperacillin alone and is similar to that of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.

TI  == the effect of ph on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
AB  == butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. it  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. to investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of ph and butyric acid concentrations. six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two  strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus. at ph 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate,  and in some cases growth was completely arrested. at ph 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mm. the maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mm, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at ph values occurring in the stomach. therefore,  butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.

TI  == toxicity of hydrogen peroxide produced by electroplated coatings to pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  == in an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. urine was collected up to  6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by  the hplc assay. the total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. the mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. the antibacterial activity in  urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (ubt), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (e. coli atcc 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (uti). for the e. coli atcc 25,922, the organism with the lowest mic, median ubts of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2  days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. for the five uropathogens (with increasing mics: k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, e. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis), the ubts decreased in general, according to mics, demonstrating the same relations of ubts for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (p. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher ubts than enoxacin. the minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (mubc), as derived from urinary concentrations, and ubts showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding mbcs as determined in mueller hinton broth. in conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as ubts, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and  longest-lasting ubts followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). a dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated uti could be worth testing.

TI  == a mixed culture recovery method indicates that enteric bacteria do not enter the  viable but nonculturable state.
AB  == a new method, called the mixed culture recovery (mcr) method, has been developed  to determine whether recovery of culturable bacterial cells from a population of  largely nonculturable cells is due to resuscitation of the nonculturable cells from a viable but nonculturable state or simply to growth of residual culturable  cells. the mcr method addresses this issue in that it involves the mixing of two  easily distinguishable strains (e.g., lactose positive and negative) in such a way that large numbers of nonculturable cells of both strains are present together with a small number of culturable cells of only one strain, performing a nutrient addition resuscitation procedure, and then plating the cells to determine whether both cell types are recoverable. in repeated experiments with strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, and salmonella choleraesuis, only cells of the culturable strain were recovered after application of various resuscitation techniques. these results suggest that the nonculturable cells were dead and that the apparent resuscitation was merely due to the growth of the remaining culturable cells.

TI  == discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  == a 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. antibacterial assays against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli imp- and a candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position a (secondary amine), at the  end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. the range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting  the first-round active sublibraries. pyridinopolyamine positions b (secondary benzylamine) and c (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. high-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18,  and 21 with mics of 1-5 microm against s. pyogenes and e. coli imp-. using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position c and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position b with position d (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier ii panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, s. pyogenes, s. pyogenes (wild-type), streptomyces aureus, and enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at mics of 1-12 microm, whereas mics for e.  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were >  100 microm. these eight compounds were not active (> 100 microm) against fungus c. albicans.

TI  == role of chemotherapeutic antagonism in opportunistic infections.
AB  == the most widely-known anti-tumor drugs often induce marked immunosuppression which can give rise to one or more sepses. anti-infection measures immediately applied can sometimes prove largely ineffective or even useless, the patient dying not as a result of the spread of the tumour but as a direct consequence of  opportunistic infection. we postulate that antagonism between anti-tumour and antimicrobial drugs may also play an important part in this. by way of illustration of this hypothesis, we have studied the action of a number of known  inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis and of dna-gyrases on certain strains of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms cultured in medium containing various concentrations of some of the best-known anti-tumour antimetabolites. the experimental data show that antimicrobial and anti-tumour drugs can sometimes induce synergic or indifferent chemotherapeutic interactions with many bacteria,  while in others the effect is antagonistic. in practice, the action of the drugs  could lead to bacterial selectivity, which, in conjunction with immunosuppression and the presence of resistant strains, could favour the evolution of opportunistic infection.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters in inhibiting bacterial migration along catheter surface.
AB  == most cases of catheter-related urinary tract infection are probably caused by organisms that migrate from the urethral meatus-catheter interface along the external surface of the catheter into the bladder. to examine the ability of bladder catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin to inhibit bacterial migration along the external surface of the catheter, a novel in vitro bladder model was used. compared with uncoated catheters, antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters significantly impeded the migration of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans (bacteriuria developed at a mean of 2-5 days vs. 9-34 days, respectively, after bacterial contamination of the catheter). although production of zones of inhibition by coated catheters may provide some protection against infection, there was no correlation between the size of zones of inhibition and level of efficacy in inhibiting bacterial migration in vitro. examination of the clinical  efficacy of these antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters is prudent.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacies of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone containing a c-7 bicyclic amine moiety with potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. we compared the in vitro and in vivo activities of cfc-222 with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin. cfc-222 was more active than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive bacteria. cfc-222 was particularly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic90], 0.2 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.2 microg/ml for ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains), and enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 0.39 microg/ml). against escherichia coli and other members of the family enterobacteriaceae, cfc-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin (mic90s for e. coli, 0.1 and 0.025 microg/ml, respectively). the in vitro activity of cfc-222 was not influenced by inoculum size, medium composition, or the presence  of horse serum. however, its activity was decreased significantly by a change in  the ph of the medium from 7.0 to 6.0, as was the case for the other quinolones tested. the in vivo protective efficacy of cfc-222 by oral administration was greater than those of the other quinolones tested in a mouse model of intraperitoneally inoculated systemic infection caused by s. aureus. cfc-222 exhibited efficacy comparable to that of ciprofloxacin in the same model of infection caused by gram-negative organisms, such as e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. in this infection model, cfc-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. these results suggest that cfc-222  may be a promising therapeutic agent in various bacterial infections.

TI  == development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  == very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. this study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents,  including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. mics of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarblue; accumed international, westlake, ohio). this study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus species, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in some instances, the mics were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. the proposed in-flight experiment will  include inoculation of the vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of mics by the mission's astronauts. ground-based studies have shown reproducible mics following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees c to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. for comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) mic values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation  of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. this procedure  can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  == the main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus saprophyticus and candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. the residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were  both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. these results support the ongoing  efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == urine bactericidal activity of pefloxacin versus norfloxacin in healthy female volunteers after a single 800-mg oral dose.
AB  == in an open randomised crossover study the antibacterial activity of pefloxacin and norfloxacin was assessed in the urine after a single 800-mg oral dose in 14 healthy female volunteers. pefloxacin demonstrated lower peak concentrations in the urine than norfloxacin (mean, 217.2 mg/l versus 492.9 mg/l as determined by the microbiological assay) but pefloxacin was present over a longer period of time in sufficient concentrations than norfloxacin. mean urine levels of at least 2 mg/l were present for 7 days after pefloxacin administration and 2 days after norfloxacin administration as determined by the microbiological assay. overall, the urinary recovery of pefloxacin and norfloxacin amounted to 49.3% and 25.1%, respectively, of the total administered dose. the average urine bactericidal activity against the five test organisms was as follows: against reference strain escherichia coli atcc 25922 susceptible to nalidixic acid (nal-s) for 5 days with pefloxacin and 2 days with norfloxacin; against three clinical isolates, one strain each of e. coli resistant to nalidixic acid (nal-r), klebsiella pneumoniae nal-r, and staphylococcus saprophyticus, for 3 days with pefloxacin and 24 h with norfloxacin; and against a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecalis for 2 days with pefloxacin and 12 h with norfloxacin. in conclusion, pefloxacin as a single  dose proved to have sufficiently high and long-lasting urine bactericidal activity against urinary pathogens. these findings support the results of a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials in patients with uncomplicated lower uti,  demonstrating a single oral dose of 800 mg pefloxacin to be as effective as a conventional treatment with comparative drugs.

TI  == is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  == the regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for escherichia coli. the clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. the addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except p. mirabilis. however, when clinical strains of e. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. there  was no difference in growth rates of e. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis,  cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. the ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.

AB  == a microbial culture collection composed of 1820 bacterial strains, including 298  actinomycete strains, was established from the roots of douglas-fir (pseudotsuga  menziesii (mirb.) franco) seedlings harvested from conifer nurseries and forest sites. two hundred and thirty-four strains inhibited the growth of fusarium, cylindrocarpon, and (or) pythium spp. in in vitro assays. a significantly greater proportion of bacterial strains from actinomycete genera exhibited antifungal properties compared with bacterial strains from nonactinomycete genera. eighty-nine percent of identified inhibitory strains were streptomyces, streptoverticillium, bacillus, pseudomonas, or burkholderia species. the actinomycete species were isolated almost exclusively from forest seedlings. recovery of inhibitory strains representing 29 microbial species was enhanced using a variety of methods to isolate microorganisms from the roots of seedlings  from nursery and forest sites. bacterial strains (including actinomycete strains) with antifungal activity were tested for in vitro growth inhibition of six clinical human bacterial pathogens (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). forty-eight percent of the tested strains inhibited one or more human pathogens, inhibitory activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens was strain specific, not species specific, and many inhibitory strains exhibited broad-spectrum activity. strains with antifungal activity against several conifer root pathogens were also more likely to inhibit multiple species of clinical bacterial pathogens.

TI  == [multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  == in 1994, microbiology laboratories of ten portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. from 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples  significant numbers of escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. were isolated. escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a great variation in resistance values of p. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. resistance to methicillin in s. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an  average of 47%, and it was even higher with s. epidermidis (c.3000) and s. haemolyticus (c.650). only vancomycin was always active against these strains. in e. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. e. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.

TI  == [in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem antibiotic].
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem, were evaluated in comparison with imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mepm), ceftazidime (caz)  and flomoxef (fmox). sulopenem had broad and potent antibacterial spectra against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterococcus faecalis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii. sulopenem showed concentration-dependent bactericidal activities against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. morphological observation using phase-contrast microscope revealed that sulopenem induced spherical cell formation with e. coli  and k. pneumoniae at lower concentrations and bacteriolysis at higher concentrations. therapeutic efficacies of sulopenem against systemic infections in mice were almost equal to those of imipenem against streptococcus pneumoniae.  while its therapeutic efficacies were superior to those of meropenem, ceftazidime and flomoxef against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae, they were inferior to those of  imipenem/cilastatin against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and a. calcoaceticus.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  == eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml,  enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, escherichia coli cs2(r+): 0.10 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, serratia marcescens:  1.56 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam  against gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of pbps of s. aureus, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, even of p. aeruginosa. affinities of sulopenem to pbps-1 and -3 of s. aureus, pbp-2 of e. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (ipm). sulopenem generally has small ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to ia and iib types of beta-lactamases than ipm. no synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. however, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. the cells of e. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 mic of sulopenem. moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-is. sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.

TI  == [in vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (cp-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (ipm), flomoxef, cefuzonam (czon) and cefotaxime. sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of ipm. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. in a killing kinetics study for haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a  concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. this effect was obtained at a concentration  8-fold lower than that of ipm. the protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. in murine experimental mixed infection with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ed50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than ipm. the therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its mic value. in guinea pigs experimental lung infection with klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than czon or cefotiam.

TI  == bacteremia in a pediatric hemodialysis unit secondary to enterococcus fecalis.
AB  == bacteremia is often a serious and recurring problem in children with hemodialysis catheters. we report an outbreak of enterococcus bacteremia in a pediatric hemodialysis unit occurring from june 1992 to june 1993. during this period, 18 episodes of bacteremia occurred in eight children; 11 infections were polymicrobial. enterococcus fecalis was associated with 13 infections in five patients (8 polymicrobial). other pathogens included enterobacter cloacae (5 infections), staphylococcus (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), and klebsiella pneumoniae (2). all enterococcus infections occurred in patients with dual-lumen  subclavian venous catheters. skin and catheter sites were culture negative, except in one patient. rectal swabs were positive for enterococcus in five patients. enterococcus was not isolated from any source within the unit. serotypes of all enterococcus isolates were different, except for 2 isolates in the same patient. starting in june 1993, catheters were flushed after dialysis with vancomycin or ampicillin. since initiating this procedure, further episodes  of enterococcus bacteremia have not occurred. a questionnaire sent to other pediatric hemodialysis units failed to identify enterococcus among 26 cases of bacteremia. in conclusion: (1) enterococcus is an unusual pathogen for hemodialysis-related bacteremia in children; (2) patients with dialysis catheters were predisposed to this infection; (3) a common source for enterococcus could not be identified by either culture or by serotyping; (4) flushing catheters with antibiotics after dialysis was effective prevention.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == typing of sequential bacterial isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  == we typed 39 sets of multiple bacterial isolates of the same species from patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic dna (pfge). isolates were cultured from different sites or over a 2-week or longer interval. staphylococcus aureus,  enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae were tested. excluding e. cloacae, 28 of 32  sets of isolates (87%) demonstrated only identical or highly related pfge types.  four of the seven sets of e. cloacae showed different types. for species other than e. cloacae, our results suggest that patients are usually colonized and infected with a single strain of these bacterial pathogens. unlike all of the other tested species, e. cloacae pfge typing differences suggested the presence of multiple strains causing colonization and infection.

TI  == experimental investigations on the immunomodulating activity of polybacterial preparation for peroral immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections.
AB  == the immunomodulating effect of a polybacterial immunostimulator urostim in experimental animal models was investigated. the preparation was created for immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections. it consists of killed bacterial cells and their lysates of four microbial species: escherichia coli expressing type 1 pili, rc mutant of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis, balb/c mice and guinea-pigs were treated orally with urostim for 5 or 10 days, respectively. a stimulatory effect of urostim on phagocytosis (increased phagocytic index and phagocytic number) of mice peritoneal exudate cells was observed. an increased number of plaque-forming cells and elevated titres of haemagglutinating antibodies in mice demonstrated activation of humoral immunity. lymphoproliferative studies showed a significant  response to phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and urostim, especially after the second application of the preparation. at the same time no changes in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes were found. an active protection of mice against a systemic infection and of guinea-pigs against uroinfection caused by gram-negative bacteria was obtained. in conclusion, the results obtained characterize urostim as an effective immunostimulator. its peroral application leads to the activation of innate resistance, cell-mediated, humoral and local immunity.

TI  == rapid identification of common human pathogens by high-resolution proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  == routine procedures for recovery of bacteria from clinical specimens involve culturing the latter on various nonselective and selective agar media. the bacteria are then identified by means of biochemical and immunological test procedures. reduction of the time required to identify the bacteria is highly desirable for rapid clinical diagnosis. towards this end the potential of proton  nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy for providing a "fingerprint" within the proton spectrum of five bacterial genera, reflecting their characteristic cell wall constituents, has been investigated. establishing a database of high-resolution proton nmr spectra of a large number of bacterial species is a prerequisite for attaining this objective. a database has been established for five common human pathogens: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. on the basis of the presence of characteristic resonances in their spectra, a simple algorithm has been developed to differentiate and identify these microorganisms. the nmr spectra of e. coli and s. aureus showed no dependency on the type of growth medium, growth density, or incubation time.

AB  == antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and mics of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (dmppc)-susceptible staphylococcus aureus subsp.  aureus (mssa), about 80% of dmppc-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 100% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, 95% of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of haemophilus influenzae.  several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc against beta-lactamase producing strains of mssa, m. (b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == [staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. bacteriologic aspects].
AB  == struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria.  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. this trial examines the bacteriologic  aspects pre and post-eswl. eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (uti) were submitted to urine  cultures pre and post-eswl. the first 50 patients underwent during and post-eswl, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of  generalized sepsis. no patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. with respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-eswl uti, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a uti post-eswl. the distribution of organisms pre and post-eswl was as follows: proteus mirabilis (22/22), escherichia coli (11/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), enterobacter cloacae (0/1), alcaligenes odorans (1/2) enterococcus faecalis (1/3), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and candida albicans (1/1). in this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-eswl probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. according to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. in 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial  infection.

TI  == effect of prestorage white cell reduction on bacterial growth in platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates stored with and without autologous white cells were produced from units of whole blood that had been purposefully contaminated with bacteria immediately after phlebotomy. the blood was inoculated with one of five  species of bacterium at either 10 or 50 colony-forming units per ml. the growth of the organisms was quantified throughout the conventional 5-day, 22 degrees c storage period of the platelet concentrates. one species, klebsiella pneumoniae,  failed to grow in any of the components. the remaining species, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and salmonella enteritidis, achieved log growth after 1 day of storage and reached a relative maximum concentration by day 3. although the concentration of bacteria immediately after  inoculation was lower in the units reduced in white cells by filtration, no significant differences were observed thereafter. data from this in vitro study support the concept that prestorage white cell reduction of platelet concentrates should not increase the likelihood of transfusion-induced septicemia.

TI  == salicylic acid prevents the adherence of bacteria and yeast to silastic catheters.
AB  == during the pathogenesis of catheter-related urinary tract infection, bacteria attach to the catheter and migrate along a biofilm into the bladder. we studied the effect of coating silastic catheters with salicylic acid on bacterial and yeast adherence. an agar roll technique, bioluminescent assay, and radiolabeling  study all produced consistent results. there was a dose related inhibition of adherence with pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans, and enterococcus faecalis. inhibition of over 90% was noted with enterobacter and pseudomonas. similar results were obtained in broth and synthetic urine. a dose related reduction in adherence was seen with all gram-negative rods and yeast as measured by a radiolabeling assay. tdmac was  used to bind the salicylic acid to the catheters with > 95% inhibition of the gram-negative rods. these studies suggest the potential role of coating catheters with salicylic acid to reduce bacterial adherence and urinary tract infection.

AB  == magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, er, was evaluated. the magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. the optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mm nacl and 5 mm ercl(3) solution. three gram-positive bacteria,  staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. qualitative analysis consisted of gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. the  magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of e. coli down to the concentration of 10 cfu ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. on average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms  was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. the thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.

AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == optimal method for culturing vascular prosthetic grafts.
AB  == vascular prosthetic infection may be underrecognized when identified by standard  culture techniques. improved microbiologic methodology may enhance detection of bacteria in prosthetic graft specimens, and thus may alter clinical decisions. quantitative culture techniques were employed to compare three methods of enhancing bacterial recovery from dacron graft cylinders seeded with commonly encountered bacterial pathogens. methods included: (1) ultrasonic bath treatment, (2) direct ultrasonic disruption, and (3) agitation on a vortex mixer. ultrasonic bath treatment released bacteria with colony counts that were consistently greater by 1 log than direct ultrasonic disruption and vortex agitation. direct ultrasonic disruption at high energy levels selectively killed gram-negative bacteria by as much as a 4 log decrease in viable organisms. agitation (vortex mixing) of the specimen produced the lowest counts among the three methods tested. these data would indicate that a 5-min ultrasonic bath treatment was the  optimal method of preparation of vascular prostheses for bacterial culture.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of cefazolin (cez) against 251 strains of various clinical isolates obtained during 1989 and 1990 were determined using the mueller-hinton agar dilution method at an inoculum level 10(6) cfu/ml. the reliability of the disk susceptility test was also studied using mueller-hinton agar and various disks at inoculum levels of 10(3-4) cfu/cm2 in estimating approximate values of mics. in addition, antimicrobial activities of cez and cefmetazole (cmz) or flomoxef (fmox) in combination were investigated against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa) using  the checkerboard agar dilution mic method and the disk diffusion test either with the disks contained cez, cmz, and fmox alone, or cez, and cmz or fmox in combination. in this study, the mics of cez against s. aureus were distributed with the 3 peak values at 0.39 microgram/ml, 3.13 micrograms/ml and > 100 micrograms/ml. mics against mssa were 0.39 microgram/ml to 0.78 microgram/ml, whereas those against mrsa were greater than 0.78 microgram/ml. mics against majority of strains of enterococcus faecalis were 25 micrograms/ml. over 90% of strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at the level of 3.13 micrograms/ml. about 60% of isolates of indole negative proteus spp. were inhibited at the levels of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml and 100% at 6.25 micrograms/ml, but mics against indole positive proteus spp., serratia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were over 100 micrograms/ml. the antimicrobial activities  of cez against these clinical isolates were not significantly different compared  to those reported about 15-20 years ago, except for s. aureus. highly resistant strains of s. aureus to cez were more prevalent in this study. the inhibitory zones obtained with the disk test were compared with mics. the results of cez disk susceptibility test with 30 micrograms disk (showa) or 10 micrograms disk (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with mics (r = -0.837 and -0.814, respectively), showing the reliavility of the disk method in estimating approximate values of mics. in the 4 category classification system currently used in japan, break points in mic values proposed are () mic < or = 3 micrograms/ml, (++) > 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) > 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) > 60 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 7.7% and false negative in 6.8% of the samples. the disk results with e. faecalis showed a higher ratio of false positive results.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of e1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  == e1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the in vitro activities of e1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic of e1077 for 90% of the strains tested [mic90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mic90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. against enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), e1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. the mic90s of e1077 for streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; e1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. e1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56  micrograms/ml, with the exception of serratia marcescens and proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). the activity of e1077 against p. aeruginosa (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. in vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. e1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. the protective effects of e1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of e1077 caused swelling of s. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in p. aeruginosa. in general, the antibacterial profile of e1077  is similar to that of cefpirome.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  == cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its mic90 is 0.125 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for haemophilus spp., neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of m. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. less than 1 mg/l is needed for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and shigella spp. the mic90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and most strains of serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and most strains of pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. cefodizime has high affinity for pbp 3 and pbp ia and ib (escherichia coli); in s. aureus it shows the highest affinity for pbp 1.

TI  == crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin alone and in combination in healthy elderly volunteers.
AB  == to better define the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity (sba) of ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents in the elderly, six healthy (greater than 65 years) volunteers with normal renal function were given ciprofloxacin alone orally, ciprofloxacin plus rifampin orally, ciprofloxacin plus clindamycin  orally, rifampin alone orally (three volunteers), and, for comparison of sba against gram-positive cocci, vancomycin intravenously. mean peak ciprofloxacin concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered significantly by coadministration of either rifampin or clindamycin. ciprofloxacin had somewhat greater sba against the oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains tested than did vancomycin, but rifampin was by far the most active single agent tested. the sba of rifampin against s. aureus was modestly antagonized during combination therapy with ciprofloxacin, but substantial sba still was present. the ciprofloxacin sba against s. aureus was completely antagonized by clindamycin if the strains were susceptible to the latter agent. ciprofloxacin had modest sba against group a streptococci and no sba against the three pneumococcal strains tested. all of the regimens had poor to absent sba against enterococcus faecalis. by contrast, ciprofloxacin had excellent sba against escherchia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and moderate sba against pseudomonas aeruginosa. combination therapy with rifampin or clindamycin in general enhanced the sba against the nonenterococcal streptococci and had no effect on the sba against the gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == the efficacy and tolerance of intravenous ofloxacin was studied in 70 patients suffering from soft tissue infections (n = 33), intra-abdominal abscesses (n = 14), septicaemia (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 9) and brucellosis (n = 2). the average daily dose was 6 mg/kg divided into two doses. pathogens treated included enterobacter cloacae (n = 14), escherichia coli (n = 12), staphylococcus aureus (n = 13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 11), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), enterococcus faecalis (n = 8) and streptococcus spp. (n = 5). most patients had several underlying diseases. most of the patients had received other antibiotic therapy without success. clinically, 41% were considered cured, 19% improved and  30% failed to respond. bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 52.5% and  persisted in 22.5%. adverse reactions included an anaphylactoid reaction, abnormal liver function (n = 13) and insomnia (n = 2). this study suggests that higher doses of ofloxacin may be needed in deep seated infections.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == quantitative changes in faecal microflora preceding necrotising enterocolitis in  premature neonates.
AB  == quantitative studies of faecal bacterial flora were carried out during the week preceding the clinical onset of 12 episodes of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis. there were considerable quantitative changes in the faecal flora preceding the clinical onset of both definite and possible episodes of necrotising enterocolitis. there was a decline in the numbers of some species from up to 72 hours before the clinical onset of the disease. enterobacteriaceae  were isolated from samples collected during the 48 hours preceding the clinical onset of all four definite episodes of necrotising enterocolitis. these were 'new' isolates in two episodes, and considerably increased numbers in another. the changes that we found are probably the result of changes in intraluminal conditions that precede the clinical onset of necrotising enterocolitis.

TI  == the role of escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  == the growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (e. coli, ent. faecalis, b. ovatis, f. varium and c. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when  the e. coli strain was haemolytic. e. coli and b. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. when non-haemolytic e. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. the inclusion of partially purified e. coli haemolysin (125 hu50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic e. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. these results indicate that e. coli haemolysin is  one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between e. coli and b. ovatus, during abscess formation.

TI  == comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  == thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (uti) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower uti) or a 14 day (upper uti) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper uti. overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. the infecting organisms were: escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), citrobacter freundii (three), klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter agglomerans, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis (one of each). all of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. the effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. the cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively.  there were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. in the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. one of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. in this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic uti.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1987). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == since 1979, ikemoto et al. have been retrospectively surveying the sensitivity of major species of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infections to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. their findings for the past year are reported below. a total of 825 clinical strains of bacteria was investigated. of this total, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.0% (231 strains) and gram-negative bacteria for 72.0% (594 strains). taxonomically, escherichia coli accounted for 34.7% (286 strains), enterococcus faecalis for 14.3% (118), pseudomonas aeruginosa for 11.0% (91), klebsiella pneumoniae for 7.8% (64), and coagulase-negative staphylococci for 7.3% (60). sensitivity spectra of these major bacteria to various drugs were as follows. 1. e. faecalis was sensitive to  parenteral imipenem (ipm) and ampicillin and oral vancomycin. it was also sensitive to ofloxacin (oflx) and ciprofloxacin (cpfx), which are new quinolones. some strains were only slightly sensitive to second and third generation cephems  cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefuzonam (czon) aminoglycosides amikacin (amk) and arbekacin (hbk), and erythromycin which is a macrolide. 2. staphylococcus aureus  was sensitive to dicloxacillin (mdipc) which is a penicillin drug, cefotiam (ctm) which is a cephem, ipm, minocycline (mino), and hbk. a fairly large number of strains were only slightly sensitive to cefazolin (cez), oflx and cpfx. 3. coagulase-negative staphylococci were sensitive to mdipc which is a penicillin derivative, cephems ctm and czon, ipm, hbk, clindamycin (cldm) and mino. some strains, however, were only slightly sensitive to a majority of these drugs. 4. e. coli was sensitive to ctm, cmx, latamoxef (lmox), ceftazidime (caz), czon, and flomoxef (fmox), all of which are second or third generation cephems. it was also sensitive to ipm, a carbapenem, carumonam (crmn), a monobactam, and new quinolones, oflx and cpfx. 5. k. pneumoniae was sensitive to cephems, viz. ctm, caz, czon, fmox and cefixime, crmn which is a monobactam, ipm, a carbapenem and new quinolones, oflx and cpfx. some strains were only slightly sensitive to ctm,  cefmetazole cefoperazone (cpz), and fmox. 6. citrobacter freundii was sensitive to crmn which is a monobactam, and new quinolones, oflx and cpfx. many strains were only slightly sensitive to cephems, viz. cez, ctm, cpz and caz. 7. enterobacter cloacae was sensitive to gentamicin and amk which are aminoglycosides, but showed a bimodal pattern of sensitivity to cpz, caz and czon, all of which are cephems, and to quinolones, oflx and cpfx.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == radio-immunoassay for formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine. i. development and application to assessment of chemotactic peptide production by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (fmlp) is the major chemotactic  peptide in escherichia coli culture supernatants. this paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (ria) for fmlp and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. the assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/l fmlp) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with f-met-leu-tyr, f-nle-leu-phe and f-met-met-met sequences (id50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/l, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (id50 = 10(5) nmol/l. culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid  chromatography before ria. all five organisms produced immunoreactive f-met peptides. a major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic fmlp was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in streptococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis cultures. in e. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive fmlp increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth  reaching 31.2 nmol/l(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/ml (n = 6). these findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a ria for fmlp will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.

TI  == new screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  == during routine membrane filter (mf) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor  colony sheen and metallic sheen on the mf surface with mendo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. to study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for mf quality, we compared five different mfs with various types and degrees of  defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. results showed that the enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more mf defects than any other combination did and was superior to the escherichia coli-mfc agar american society for testing and materials method for grid line inhibition. filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. poor colony sheen and sheen on the mf surface were best detected with enterobacter aerogenes on mendo agar. the  use of tryptic soy agar and mendo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of mf irregularities. of the 142 mf lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. this  method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size mfs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.

AB  == the reliability of the cephalothin (cet) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 248 strains and using showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cet) and difco discs (6 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cet). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cet disc tests, which is widely used in japan, was reevaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. the results obtained with the disc methods were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cet disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. with the showa disc susceptibility test, 15 out of the 248 strains (6.0%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. with the difco disc test, 18 out of the 248 strains (7.3%) tested showed false positive results and 6 (2.4%) showed false negative results. excluding enterococcus faecalis from the test, results because better in the quantitative estimation of  mics, resulting false positive rates of 3.2% (showa), and 4.4% (difco). a 3 category system of the interpretation of disc test is generally used in the usa and europe. mic break points proposed for the classification of the cet test are  sensitive, mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, and resistance, mic greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. with the showa disc susceptibility test, 14 out of the 248 strains (5.6%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains  (2.4%) showed false negative results. with the difco disc test 7 out of the 248 strains (2.8%) showed false positive results and 21 strains (8.5%) showed false negative results. in this study, mic70s of cet against staphylococcus aureus and  staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. cet was not so effective against gram-negative rods except klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. mic70s against k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and e. coli were 6.25, 3.13, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively.

AB  == t-3262 (tosufloxacin tosilate), a new oral pyridone carboxylic acid agent, was investigated for its biliary excretion and clinical efficacy and safety to evaluate its usefulness in the treatment of cholecystitis. t-3262 was administered to a total of 4 healthy volunteers for 2 days at a dose of 150 mg every 8 hours, and a-, b- or c-bile were collected using the meltzer-lyon method  at 10-11 hours after the final administration. bile concentrations of t-3262 in 3 cases were 0.33-2.05 micrograms/ml (a-bile), 6.13-9.50 micrograms/ml (b-bile) and 1.11-2.70 micrograms/ml (c-bile). thus, t-3262 levels in b-bile were 15-34 times  higher than serum levels (0.28-0.41 micrograms/ml). only a trace of serum concentration of t-3262 was detected in another case with the concentration in b-bile was 0.132 micrograms/ml. a total of 10 patients with cholecystitis were treated with t-3262 at a dose level of 150 mg per dose 3 times daily for 1 to 20  days. the clinical efficacy was excellent in 1 case, good in 5 cases and fair in  2 cases and unevaluable in 2 cases, thus the clinical efficacy rate was 75%. bacteriologically, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and haemophilus parahaemolyticus were isolated from biles of 3 patients before treatment. upon the treatment, e. faecalis was eradicated and k. pneumoniae was unchanged. the fate of h. parahaemolyticus was not known because of examination was not done after treatment. side effects were observed in 2 cases with diarrhea in 1 case and epigastric pain in another case. but those symptoms disappeared after cessation of administration of t-3262. abnormal laboratory test values were not observed.

TI  == growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  == in 1986 the allowable platelet storage time was reduced from 7 to 5 days because  of a recent increase in septic deaths associated with platelet transfusion. in this study, the growth curves of two gram-positive and two gram-negative organisms in platelets stored for 7 days in clx and pl-732 bags were evaluated. platelets in clx bags were inoculated with 10(1), 10(2), and 10(3) organisms and  10(2) organisms were introduced into pl-732 bags. test organisms were inoculated  into trypticase soy broth as a control. all four bacteria grew rapidly in trypticase soy broth, reaching 10(9) organisms per ml within 48 hours. in both clx and pl-732 bags, the growth pattern of gram-positive organisms was generally  logarithmic during the first few days of storage. a concentration of 10(8) organisms per ml was present by day 3 or 4, after which further proliferation was inhibited by the high density of bacteria in the platelets. in pl-732 bags, the proliferation of gram-negative organisms followed a pattern similar to that of the gram-positive bacteria. however, gram-negative organisms grew less well in clx bags.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of qa-241, a new tricyclic quinolone derivative.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibilities of 1,310 clinical isolates to qa-241, a novel tricyclic quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with susceptibilities to norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. the mics of qa-241 for 90% of staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis isolates, and streptococcal species ranged from 1.56 to 6.25 micrograms/ml, and the activity of qa-241 was similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin but two to four times less potent than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. at the concentration of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, qa-241 inhibited 90% of haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and gram-negative enteric bacteria except for serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii. qa-241 was moderately active (mic for 90% of strains tested, 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml) against s. marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis. the antibacterial activity of qa-241 was roughly comparable to that of enoxacin but two to four times less potent than that of ofloxacin. in systemic infections in mice with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, the efficacy of qa-241 was  generally greater than that of norfloxacin and similar to those of ofloxacin and  ciprofloxacin. in urinary tract infections in mice with escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa, qa-241 was as active as ofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin but less active than ciprofloxacin. in pulmonary infections in mice with klebsiella pneumoniae, the effectiveness of qa-241 was similar to that of ofloxacin.

TI  == bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin sc 47111 (ny-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  == the bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x mic)  and suprainhibitory (4 x mic) concentrations. five strains each of the following  microorganisms were studied: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by mics. however, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x mic and 4 x mic were tested. for many of  the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. the low mics seen for the gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x mic were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.

AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in japan and u.s.a., respectively. after an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of cpz and sbt in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. in urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. antimicrobial interaction  studies using various combinations of cpz and sbt were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of sbt on the antimicrobial activity of cpz in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. sbt increased the activity of cpz against various clinical isolates tested except enterococcus faecalis. cpz-sbt at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of cpz, resulting in decreases in mic values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. these drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. based on pharmacokinetic data for cpz and sbt, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of cpz-sbt at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in japan and u.s.a., respectively, are appropriate. the effect of sbt on the activity of cpz was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. sbt/cpz, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. the mic80 of sbt/cpz (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) cfu/ml inoculum size were as follows: s. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and e. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. those of gram-negative bacilli were: escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == reliability of the cefamandole (cmd) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cmd). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cmd disc tests, which is normally used in japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose  of administration. the results obtained with the disc method were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cmd disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. in this study,  approximately 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by cmd at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to cmd at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. cmd was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. about 90% of staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml cmd of highly methicillin-resistant strains  (mic greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of s. aureus were examined. ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to cmd, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of e-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. e-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. e-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis. in general, e-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics giving 90% inhibition for e-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. the activity of e-3846 increased at acid ph; in contrast, acid ph caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. in vivo, e-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental s. faecalis, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.

AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == a simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. the activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with edta + tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. except for phenoxyethanol against pv. stuartii and possibly ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. however, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate ps. aeruginosa. it is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.

AB  == many different infections including urinary tract infections occur in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. furthermore, in most cases, it is practically impossible to clearly identify causative organisms as in cases of pelvic peritonitis and parametritis. in many incidents, causative organisms consist mainly of escherichia coli, and recently, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. have also been identified. because the new antibiotic, imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk-0787/mk-0791), is very effective against these bacteria, and because of its wide spectrum, we believe it is especially effective against infections of obstetrics and gynecology. the distribution of this antibiotic into various organs and tissues was similar to other drugs, and it reaches a high level in internal genital organs, hence it should be effective for the treatment of obstetric/gynecological infections. its toxicity is low also, and no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed in our trials. results of our trials are summarized below: of 9 cases of obstetric/gynecological infections, the antibiotic showed excellent effectiveness against 2, good against 6, for the  efficacy ratio of 89%. no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed.

TI  == immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == studies of various models of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. a limited number of studies carried out in models of klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. the efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections  has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. most studies of combined therapy in  gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. experiments in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. the enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. with p. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. for both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. these in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.

TI  == the efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. a 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. the intestine was then divided at  each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. the segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. this experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. within three days 40% of the animals  receiving pefloxacin died. animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or  gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. only 5% of these animals died. thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

TI  == infection control during parenteral nutrition therapy.
AB  == parenteral nutrition therapy can achieve an anabolic state in patients who are unable to maintain normal nitrogen balance; however, it may be associated with infectious complications. infections may be related to contamination of the cannula and the cannula wound, of the infusate, or of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. a variety of microorganisms has been associated with these infections. the exact mechanisms that initiate cannula-related infection are poorly understood. susceptibility of the host, the method and site of cannula insertion, colonization of parenteral nutrition cannulas, use of parenteral nutrition systems for multiple purposes, cannula material, and other factors may  all play some role. controlling infections depend on many factors, including quality control processes to ensure sterility of parenteral nutrition solutions,  attention to aseptic technique during cannula insertion, procedures to prevent in-use contamination, proper care of the cannula insertion site, and proper management of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. in addition, infectious complications appear to be reduced by an organized team that follows infection control protocols. many facets of parenteral nutrition therapy are based on data from uncontrolled clinical investigations. well-designed, controlled clinical trials may provide data that will further minimize the risks  associated with parenteral nutrition therapy.

AB  == cefminox sodium (cmnx, mt-141), a new semisynthetic cephamycin, having marked resistance to beta-lactamase, and a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacterial species, including haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii, cmnx has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. for therapeutic purpose, cmnx was given in a daily dose of 0.5 g (0.5 g x  1) to 2 g (1 x 2) by intravenous drip infusion for 4 to 8 days to 24 cases with acute peritonitis (17 cases with acute appendicitis, 1 with localized peritonitis after gastrectomy, 1 with diffuse peritonitis due to perforative duodenal ulcer and 5 with panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction). the clinical response was rated excellent in 9 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case and poor in none. no adverse effect was observed. there were 29 strains isolated organisms included 12 escherichia coli, some enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. these isolated organisms were eradicated after cmnx treatment, except a strain of e. faecalis was decreased. in 19 cases of them, 16 cases with acute peritonitis due to acute appendicitis and 3 cases with acute panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction, cmnx was administered intravenously in a dose of 1 g (1 case was 0.5 g) before or during the operation, and tissue specimens and body  fluids samples were taken during the operation. cmnx concentration was determined to a bioassay with escherichia coli nihj or vibrio vercolans atcc 8461 as the test organisms. cmnx concentrations in purulent ascites were 47.2 +/- 38.5 micrograms/ml (n = 23), those in infected appendix wall were 32.2 +/- 21.7 micrograms/g (n = 16), that in pus in appendix were 22.1 +/- 24.3 micrograms/ml (n = 8) and that in other non infected tissues were 24.3 +/- 22.0 micrograms/g (n = 8). cmnx concentrations in infected tissues were higher than the non infected tissues. in the 3 cases with empyemic appendicitis, cmnx levels in pus in appendix were more higher than that in appendix wall itself. therefore, cmnx sodium appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy on acute peritonitis.

TI  == lymphocyte proliferative responses to bacterial antigens in b27-associated arthropathies.
AB  == lymphocyte transformation tests to yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 and 0:6, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis antigens have been carried out in ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis/reiter's disease and controls. ankylosing spondylitis cases gave significantly lower responses than reactive arthritis/reiter's to yersinia enterocolitica 0:6 (p = 0.003) and klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.008), and less than controls to s. faecalis (p = 0.008). it appears, therefore, that within the b27 arthritis population there is heterogeneity of cell-mediated response to certain enteric bacteria, with the hyporesponders manifesting ankylosing spondylitis and the hyper-responders reactive arthritis/reiter's disease.

TI  == trends in bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == concern over the development of drug resistance by common pathogens has grown over recent years. in order to discover and describe possible trends at this institution, susceptibility data for 18 organisms and 21 antimicrobial agents for the years 1975 through 1982 at the veterans administration medical center in oklahoma city were reviewed. summaries of susceptibility data for 64 major combinations of drugs and organisms are presented. two gram-positive organisms (enterococcus group d and staphylococcus aureus) as well as a gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa) appear to be decreasing in susceptibility to several drugs. however, some gram-negative bacilli (proteus, serratia, and enterobacter spp. and klebsiella pneumoniae) showed evidence of markedly increasing susceptibility to certain drugs.

TI  == detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  == the production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. the genera were: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, rare enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. with this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. the data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. the nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == [evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the atp-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  == bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in atp content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. the results obtained were as follows: the bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the atp-bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by cfu assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming  and more simple than other methods. using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. the serum suppressed the growth rate of e. coli, str.  fecalis, cbs, kleb. pneumoniae and staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. the anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional disc method. thus the sensitivity test  under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. these results suggest the usefulness of atp-bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.

TI  == a microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, enterobacter, klebsiella, proteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis. using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. a regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. the results on mueller-hinton agar are very similar to those on iso-sensitest medium. like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.

TI  == the screening of four aminoglycosides in the selective decontamination of the digestive tract in mice.
AB  == the suppressive effect of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin and paromomycin on the aerobic endogenous flora and on the colonization resistance of the digestive tract was tested by administering one of the antibiotics orally at five different dose levels. at a certain dose level, all antibiotics suppressed the endogenous enterobacteriaceae species. amikacin was particularly effective in this respect.  low doses of amikacin rapidly destroyed the colonization resistance. this resistance only remained unaffected in animals treated with tobramycin in doses that were still adequate to completely suppress the endogenous enterobacteriaceae species. we concluded that of all the antibiotics tested in this study, only tobramycin may have a future in (clinical) application for the selective decontamination of the digestive tract. selective decontamination can be considered an effective method for infection prevention in leukopenic patients.

AB  == the survival times of staph. aureus, strept. faecalis, e. coli, klebs. pneumoniae, ser. marcescens and p. aeruginosa were found out on aluminium foil. it was examined whether there exists a dependence on the initial colony count and in mixed cultures a mutual influence of the several species of bacteria. the longest survival times were found among the grampositive cocci. ser. marcescens and klebs. pneumoniae could no more be indicated after 19 days in case of initial colony count of log 7.0/cm2; e. coli could no more be shown after 14 days. p. aeruginosa had the shortest survival time. the dependence on the initial colony count was ascertained in 3 different concentrations of bacteria. the highest concentrations showed the smallest reduction of cocci and the longest survival times of enterobacteriaceae respectively. the middle and lowest initial colony counts showed quicker reduction or shorter survival times. ser. marcescens was more resistant to drying than klebs. pneumoniae. the quickest dying rates showed  p. aeruginosa without any dependence on initial colony count. in mixed cultures with staph. aureus or strept. faecalis survival times of enterobacteriaceae were  longer; the same result gave klebs. pneumoniae in culture together with ser. marcescens. the following explanation might be possible: because of the drying resistance of grampositive cocci the total bacteria number in these mixed cultures after several days is higher than in monocultures of e. coli, klebs. pneumoniae or ser. marcescens. this protects the enterobacteriaceae against external influences for a longer time. therefore it is understandable that the effect increases with the length of duration. the same interpretation could apply to the mixed cultures of klebs. pneumoniae/ser. marcescens.

AB  == the minimal antibiotic concentration (mac) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight  times the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) to 1/128 of the mic. colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the mic was determined, and the mic:mac ratio,  which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. the mic:mac ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. there is no relation between the mics and the mic:mac ratios. the highest ratios were given by proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (mic:mac mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis (mic:mac means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).

AB  == the abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51cr-labeled bacteria. for each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of  escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). the organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.

AB  == the synthesis, microbiological profile and in vivo effectiveness in laboratory animals of a series of cephalosporins having 7-acyl substituents derived from methylthioacetic acid are described. structure-activity relationships examined include the effect of oxidation of the side-chain sulfur atom, replacement of the (side-chain) methyl hydrogens by fluorine and replacement of the 3-acetoxy substituent by thioheterocycles. one derivative, 7-trifluoromethylthioacetamido-3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-ylthiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 -carboxylic acid (sk&f 59962), was found to have outstanding antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == determination of site of infection in endocarditis.
AB  == medical-surgical treatment of antibiotic refractory endocarditis requires determination of the site of infection, which is not always possible with conventional cardiac catheterization. the cases of two patients with right-sided  endocarditis who survived after combined medical-surgical therapy are presented.  one had persistent pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia and three possible sites of  infection. multiple quantitative blood cultures proximal and distal to each suspected site indicated the pulmonary valve alone was infected. the second had sustained bacteremia with three enteric organisms and no apparent valvular abnormality. quantitative cultures excluded the abdomen as the continuing source  of bacteremia and suggested the tricuspid valve was infected. this was confirmed  by a second catheterization using multiple cultures in conjuction with dye dilution studies, intracardiac phonocardiography, and angiography. these bacteriologic and cardiologic techniques may be especially useful in detecting right-sided endocarditis and may also be helpful in detecting concomitant infection of both sides of the heart.

TI  == asymptomatic bacteriuria in schoolchildren in newcastle upon tyne.
AB  == a screening survey for asymptomatic bacteriuria (asb) in 13464 schoolgirls aged 4 to 18 years in newcastle upon tyne showed an overall prevalence of 1.9%. in girls 4 to 6 years it was 1.4%, in girls aged 7 to 11 years it was 2.5%, in girls aged  12 to 18 years it was 1.6%, a statistically significant rise and fall. renal scarring was found in 39 (15%) of 254 girls with asb. neither the prevalence nor  the severity of renal scarring increased with age. there was no association between asb and social class. of the 254 girls with asb, 24% had no symptoms. infections with klebsiella were more frequently associated with renal scarring than infections with esch. coli. the prevalence of asb in 1595 boys aged 5 to 18  was low, 0.2%. ureteric reflux was present in 15% of girls without renal scarring and in 46% of those with renal scarring (p less than 0.001). renal scarring also  showed a significant association with duplication, hydroureter, or single saccules in the bladder. the greater the severity of scarring the more frequently was reflux present. this study gave no evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria leads to progressive renal damage during childhood. it therefore does not support the recommendation for prescriptive screening of schoolchildren, but emphasizes the need for prospective studies of the natural history of asb.

TI  == hydrophobic grid-membrane filters: new approach to microbiological enumeration.
AB  == a square grid pattern, printed in hydrophobic material on conventional membrane filters, subdivided the surface into a plurality of areas. this separated colonies from one another and prevented lateral growth, spreading, and confluence. very high colony-packing densities were achieved (2,500/in(2); ca. 1.61 x 10(5)/cm(2)) reducing the need to dilute samples. recovery of organisms was better than on conventional filters, particularly at high inoculum levels. at the same time, visibility of normally pale or diffuse colonies was improved, since colonies grew upwards instead of sideways, and counting was facilitated because colonies grew in orderly arrays.

TI  == amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

TI  == colonization resistance of the digestive tract in conventional and antibiotic-treated mice.
AB  == the effect of oral administration of antibiotics on the intestinal flora of conventional mice and their resistance to colonization by orally introduced escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied. colonization resistance (cr) was expressed as the log of the oral bacterial dose  followed by a persistent take in 50% of the contaminated animals. the intestinal  flora was virtually eliminated by the antibiotics and this elimination was accompanied by a precipitous fall of cr. cr gradually returned to normal values during the period of repopulation of the intestinal tract by the organisms surviving the treatment. antibiotic treatment resulted in the disappearance of enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, staphylococci and yeasts and, under appropriate  housing conditions, the animals remained free of these organisms indefinitely. germ-free mice contaminated with the intestinal flora of an antibiotic-treated animal and their offspring housed in a germ-free isolator showed high values of cr. their intestinal flora consisted of anaerobic bacteria only. apparently, these anaerobes are responsible for cr in these and in conventional mice.

TI  == vitamin b12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  == the mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject  of this study. bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. a primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), ph dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl  inhibitor n-ethyl-maleimide. protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all b(12) uptake. this primary uptake phase is thought to  represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. second stage uptake was slower, ph and temperature dependent, required living bacteria,  and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or n-ethyl-maleimide. this phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of b(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for b(12), all organisms except streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. two gram-positive organisms. bacillus subtilis and group a streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin b(12) uptake values; gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. binding constants (k(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)m for b. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)m for klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)m). competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin b(12) may be inferred from the  similarity of these constants. these observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous b(12), may play a role  in the pathogenesis of the vitamin b(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

TI  == antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  == a series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in other  comparative laboratory tests against p. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. an examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. the compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. results of studies with a cell-free p. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for p. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
