[evaluation of the antimicrobial action of honey against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, listeria monocytogenes and aspergillus niger. evaluation of its microbiological charge].
the evaluation of the microbiological charge present in costa rican samples as the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity over different microorganisms, including those associated to wound infections, will allow to emit criteria referred to its use in therapeutic treatments, specially as alternative therapy for cases involving antibiotic resistant bacteria. the microbiological charge of 25 honey samples, acquired in costa rican markets was evaluated through several indicators including total plate aerobic count, total plate anaerobic count, total aerobic spore count, total anaerobic spore count and molds and yeast count. also, samples were inoculated in tubes with chopped meat media and plated in egg yolk agar in order to determine the presence of clostridium botulinum. for the antimicrobial activity evaluation, the diffusion method in muller hinton agar was performed, testing different honey concentrations (100, 75, 50, 25, 12,5 and 6,25 % v/v) against staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), staphylococcus epidermidis (ucr 2902), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 9027), escherichia coli (atcc25922), salmonella enteritidis (atcc 13076), listeria monocytogenes (atcc 19116) and aspergillus niger. the results obtained for the microbiological characterization of honey show that 91% of samples had counts equal or lower than 1,0 x 10(1) cfu/g. no positive result was obtained for the isolation of c. botulinum. 24 of the samples analyzed inhibited the growth of s. aureus even in a 25% v/v concentration, nevertheless, a. niger was no inhibited by any of the samples tested.
