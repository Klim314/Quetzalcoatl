TI  == recombinant lactobacilli expressing linoleic acid isomerase can modulate the fatty acid composition of host adipose tissue in mice.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that oral administration of a metabolically active bifidobacterium breve strain, with ability to form cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla), resulted in modulation of the fatty acid composition of the host, including significantly elevated concentrations of c9, t11 cla and omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in liver and adipose tissue. in this study, we investigated whether a recombinant lactobacillus expressing linoleic acid isomerase (responsible for production of t10, c12 cla) from propionibacterium acnes (pai) could influence the fatty acid composition of different tissues in a  mouse model. linoleic-acid-supplemented diets (2 %, w/w) were fed in combination  with either a recombinant t10, c12 cla-producing lactobacillus paracasei nfbc 338 (lb338), or an isogenic (vector-containing) control strain, to balb/c mice for 8  weeks. a third group of mice received linoleic acid alone (2 %, w/w). tissue fatty acid composition was assessed by glc at the end of the trial. ingestion of  the strain expressing linoleic acid isomerase was associated with a 4-fold increase (p<0.001) in t10, c12 cla in adipose tissues of the mice when compared with mice that received the isogenic non-cla-producing strain. the livers of the  mice that received the recombinant cla-producing lb338 also contained a 2.5-fold  (albeit not significantly) higher concentration of t10, c12 cla, compared to the  control group. these data demonstrate that a single gene (encoding linoleic acid  isomerase) expressed in an intestinal microbe can influence the fatty acid composition of host fat.
