TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == manipulating the gut microbiota to maintain health and treat disease.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota composition varies between healthy and diseased individuals for numerous diseases. although any cause or effect relationship between the alterations in the gut microbiota and disease is not always clear, targeting the intestinal microbiota might offer new possibilities for prevention and/or treatment of disease. objective: here we review some examples of manipulating the intestinal microbiota by prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbial transplants. results: prebiotics are best known for their ability to increase the number of bifidobacteria. however, specific prebiotics could potentially also stimulate other species they can also stimulate other species associated with health, like akkermansia muciniphila, ruminococcus bromii, the roseburia/enterococcus rectale group, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. probiotics have beneficial health effects for different diseases and digestive symptoms. these effects can be due to the direct effect of the probiotic bacterium or its products itself, as well as effects of the probiotic on the resident microbiota. probiotics can influence the microbiota composition as well  as the activity of the resident microbiota. fecal microbial transplants are a drastic intervention in the gut microbiota, aiming for total replacement of one microbiota by another. with numerous successful studies related to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection, the potential of fecal microbial transplants to treat other diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic and cardiovascular disorders is  under investigation. conclusions: improved knowledge on the specific role of gut  microbiota in prevention and treatment of disease will help more targeted manipulation of the intestinal microbiota. further studies are necessary to see the (long term) effects for health of these interventions.

TI  == essential oils have different effects on human pathogenic and commensal bacteria  in mixed faecal fermentations compared with pure cultures.
AB  == a static batch culture system inoculated with human faeces was used to determine  the influence of essential oil compounds (eocs) on mixed faecal microbiota. bacteria were quantified using quantitative pcr of 16s rrna genes. incubation for 24 h of diluted faeces from six individuals caused enrichment of bifidobacterium  spp., but proportions of other major groups were unaffected. thymol and geraniol  at 500 p.p.m. suppressed total bacteria, resulting in minimal fermentation. thymol at 100 p.p.m. had no effect, nor did eugenol or nerolidol at 100 or 500 p.p.m. except for a slight suppression of eubacterium hallii. methyl isoeugenol at 100 or 500 p.p.m. suppressed the growth of total bacteria, accompanied by a large fall in the molar proportion of propionate formed. the relative abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii was unaffected except with thymol at 500 p.p.m. the ability of eocs to control numbers of the pathogen clostridium difficile was  investigated in a separate experiment, in which the faecal suspensions were amended by the addition of pure culture of c. difficile. numbers of c. difficile  were suppressed by thymol and methyl isoeugenol at 500 p.p.m. and to a lesser extent at 100 p.p.m. eugenol and geraniol gave rather similar suppression of c. difficile numbers at both 100 and 500 p.p.m. nerolidol had no significant effect. it was concluded from these and previous pure-culture experiments that thymol and geraniol at around 100 p.p.m. could be effective in suppressing pathogens in the  small intestine, with no concern for beneficial commensal colonic bacteria in the distal gut.

TI  == temporal bacterial community dynamics vary among ulcerative colitis patients after fecal microbiota transplantation.
AB  == objectives: fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) from healthy donors, which is  an effective alternative for treatment of clostridium difficile-associated disease, is being considered for several disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic syndrome. disease remission upon fmt is thought to be facilitated by an efficient colonization of healthy donor microbiota, but knowledge of the composition and temporal stability of patient microbiota after fmt is lacking. methods: five patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (mayo score >/=6) and refractory to standard therapy received fmt via nasojejunal tube and enema. in addition to clinical activity and adverse events, the patients' fecal bacterial communities were monitored at multiple time points for up to 12 weeks using 16s rrna gene-targeted pyrosequencing. results: fmt elicited fever and a temporary increase of c-reactive protein. abundant bacteria from donors established in recipients, but  the efficiency and stability of donor microbiota colonization varied greatly. a positive clinical response was observed after 12 weeks in one patient whose microbiota had been effectively augmented by fmt. this augmentation was marked by successive colonization of donor-derived phylotypes including the anti-inflammatory and/or short-chain fatty acid-producing faecalibacterium prausnitzii, rosebura faecis, and bacteroides ovatus. disease severity (as measured by the mayo score) was associated with an overrepresentation of enterobacteriaceae and an underrepresentation of lachnospiraceae. conclusions: this study highlights the value of characterizing temporally resolved microbiota  dynamics for a better understanding of fmt efficacy and provides potentially useful diagnostic indicators for monitoring fmt success in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == comparison of bacterial quantities in left and right colon biopsies and faeces.
AB  == aim: to compare quantities of predominant and pathogenic bacteria in mucosal and  faecal samples. methods: twenty patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy with endoscopically and histologically normal mucosa were recruited to the study, 14 subjects of which also supplied faecal (f) samples between 15 d to 105 d post colonoscopy. mucosal biopsies were taken from each subject from the midportion of the ascending colon (right side samples, rm) and the sigmoid (left side samples,  lm). predominant intestinal and mucosal bacteria including clostridial 16s rrna gene clusters iv and xivab, bacteroidetes, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium spp., akkermansia muciniphila (a. muciniphila), veillonella spp., collinsella spp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii (f. prausnitzii) and putative pathogens such as escherichia coli (e. coli), clostridium difficile (c. difficile), helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). host dna was quantified from the mucosal samples with human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene targeting qpcr. paired t tests and the pearson correlation were applied for statistical analysis. results: the most prominent bacterial groups were clostridial groups iv and xiva+b and bacteroidetes and bacterial species f. prausnitzii in both sample types. h. pylori and s. aureus were not detected and c. difficile was detected in only one mucosal sample and three faecal samples. e. coli was detected in less than half of the mucosal samples at both sites, but was present in all faecal samples. all detected bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae,  were present at higher levels in the faeces than in the mucosa, but the different locations in the colon presented comparable quantities (rm, lm and f followed by  p(1) for rm vs f, p(2) for lm vs f and p(3) for rm vs lm: 4.17 +/- 0.60 log(10)/g, 4.16 +/- 0.56 log(10)/g, 5.88 +/- 1.92 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.011, p(2) = 0.0069, p(3) = 0.9778 for a. muciniphila; 6.25 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 6.09 +/- 0.81 log(10)/g, 8.84 +/- 1.38 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) = 0.0002, p(3) = 0.6893 for bacteroidetes; 5.27 +/- 1.68 log(10)/g, 5.38 +/- 2.06 log(10)/g, 8.20 +/- 1.14 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.7535 for bifidobacterium spp.; 6.44 +/- 1.15 log(10)/g, 6.07 +/-1.45 log(10)/g, 9.74 +/-1.13 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.637 for clostridium cluster iv; 6.65 +/- 1.23 log(10)/g, 6.57 +/- 1.52 log(10)/g, 9.13 +/- 0.96 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001,  p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.9317 for clostridium cluster xiva; 4.57 +/- 1.44 log(10)/g, 4.63 +/- 1.34 log(10)/g, 7.05 +/- 2.48 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.012, p(2) = 0.0357, p(3) = 0.7973 for collinsella spp.; 7.66 +/- 1.50 log(10)/g, 7.60 +/- 1.05 log(10)/g, 10.02 +/- 2.02 log(10)/g, p(1) </= 0.0001, p(2) = 0.0013, p(3) =  0.9919 for f. prausnitzsii; 6.17 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 5.85 +/- 0.93 log(10)/g, 7.25 +/- 1.01 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.0243, p(2) = 0.0319, p(3) = 0.6982 for veillonella spp.; 4.68 +/- 1.21 log(10)/g, 4.71 +/- 0.83 log(10)/g, 5.70 +/- 2.00 log(10)/g,  p(1) = 0.1927, p(2) = 0.0605, p(3) = 0.6476 for enterobacteriaceae). the bifidobacterium spp. counts correlated significantly between mucosal sites and mucosal and faecal samples (pearson correlation coefficients 0.62, p = 0.040 and  0.81, p = 0.005 between the right mucosal sample and faeces and the left mucosal  sample and faeces, respectively). conclusion: non-invasive faecal samples do not  reflect bacterial counts on the mucosa at the individual level, except for bifidobacteria often analysed in probiotic intervention studies.

TI  == sensitivity of pathogenic and commensal bacteria from the human colon to essential oils.
AB  == the microbiota of the intestinal tract plays an important role in colonic health, mediating many effects of dietary components on colonic health and during enteric infections. in the context of the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance in gut bacteria, complementary therapies are required for the prevention and treatment of enteric infections. here we report the potential application of essential oils (eo) and pure eo compounds to improve human gut health. nerolidol, thymol, eugenol and geraniol inhibited growth of the pathogens escherichia coli o157 : h7(vt(-)), clostridium difficile dsm1296, clostridium perfringens dsm11780, salmonella typhimurium 3530 and salmonella enteritidis s1400 at a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) varying from 50 to 500 p.p.m. most eo showed greater toxicity to pathogens than to commensals. however, the beneficial commensal faecalibacterium prausnitzii was sensitive to eo at similar  or even lower concentrations than the pathogens. the eo showed dose-dependent effects on cell integrity, as measured using propidium iodide, of gram-positive bacteria. these effects were not strongly correlated with growth inhibition, however, suggesting that cell membrane damage occurred but was not the primary cause of growth inhibition. growth inhibition of gram-negative bacteria, in contrast, occurred mostly without cell integrity loss. principal component analysis showed clustering of responses according to bacterial species rather than to the identity of the eo, with the exception that responses to thymol and nerolidol clustered away from the other eo. in conclusion, the selective effects  of some eo might have beneficial effects on gut health if chosen carefully for effectiveness against different species.

TI  == inflammatory bowel diseases phenotype, c. difficile and nod2 genotype are associated with shifts in human ileum associated microbial composition.
AB  == we tested the hypothesis that crohn's disease (cd)-related genetic polymorphisms  involved in host innate immunity are associated with shifts in human ileum-associated microbial composition in a cross-sectional analysis of human ileal samples. sanger sequencing of the bacterial 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene and 454 sequencing of 16s rrna gene hypervariable regions (v1-v3 and v3-v5), were conducted on macroscopically disease-unaffected ileal biopsies collected from 52  ileal cd, 58 ulcerative colitis and 60 control patients without inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) undergoing initial surgical resection. these subjects also were genotyped for the three major nod2 risk alleles (leu1007fs, r708w, g908r) and the atg16l1 risk allele (t300a). the samples were linked to clinical metadata, including body mass index, smoking status and clostridia difficile infection. the sequences were classified into seven phyla/subphyla categories using the naive bayesian classifier of the ribosome database project. centered log ratio transformation of six predominant categories was included as the dependent variable in the permutation based mancova for the overall composition with stepwise variable selection. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were conducted to measure the relative frequencies of the clostridium coccoides - eubacterium rectales group and the faecalibacterium prausnitzii spp. empiric logit transformations of the relative frequencies of these two microbial groups were included in permutation-based ancova. regardless of sequencing method, ibd phenotype, clostridia difficile and nod2 genotype were selected as associated (fdr </= 0.05) with shifts in overall microbial composition. ibd phenotype and nod2 genotype were also selected as associated with shifts in the relative frequency of the c. coccoides--e. rectales group. ibd phenotype, smoking and ibd  medications were selected as associated with shifts in the relative frequency of  f. prausnitzii spp. these results indicate that the effects of genetic and environmental factors on ibd are mediated at least in part by the enteric microbiota.

TI  == changes in human fecal microbiota due to chemotherapy analyzed by taqman-pcr, 454 sequencing and pcr-dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == background: we investigated whether chemotherapy with the presence or absence of  antibiotics against different kinds of cancer changed the gastrointestinal microbiota. methodology/principal findings: feces of 17 ambulant patients receiving chemotherapy with or without concomitant antibiotics were analyzed before and after the chemotherapy cycle at four time points in comparison to 17 gender-, age- and lifestyle-matched healthy controls. we targeted 16s rrna genes  of all bacteria, bacteroides, bifidobacteria, clostridium cluster iv and xiva as  well as c. difficile with taqman qpcr, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) fingerprinting and high-throughput sequencing. after a significant drop in the abundance of microbiota (p = 0.037) following a single treatment the microbiota recovered within a few days. the chemotherapeutical treatment marginally affected the bacteroides while the clostridium cluster iv and xiva were significantly more sensitive to chemotherapy and antibiotic treatment. dgge  fingerprinting showed decreased diversity of clostridium cluster iv and xiva in response to chemotherapy with cluster iv diversity being particularly affected by antibiotics. the occurrence of c. difficile in three out of seventeen subjects was accompanied by a decrease in the genera bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, veillonella and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. enterococcus faecium increased following chemotherapy. conclusions/significance: despite high individual variations, these results suggest that the observed changes in the human gut microbiota may favor colonization with c. difficile and enterococcus faecium. perturbed microbiota may be a target for specific mitigation with safe pre- and probiotics.

TI  == bacteria as trigger for chronic gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  == apart from acute infections, microorganisms may also induce or perpetuate chronic inflammatory diseases and reversible or irreversible proliferation of various cells in the gastrointestinal tract (the extreme being adenocarcinoma and lymphoma). helicobacter pylori is not only involved in the pathogenesis of lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma. the steps and mechanisms of the carcinogenic process involve host predisposition, environmental factors, and strain virulence. the steps of lymphoma genesis include chronic inflammation, acquisition of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the stomach, proliferation of the b lymphocytes in an inflammatory context, acquisition of genetic anomalies and dysregulation of the nf-kappab pathway. the role of campylobacter jejuni in immunoproliferative small bowel disease has also been shown and eradication of this bacterium can cure the lymphoma at its early stage. the evidence for the role of some bacteria in colon cancer development is discussed. opportunistic pathogens are detected in the stools or mucosa of a proportion of subjects with crohn's disease. they include mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, adherent invasive escherichia coli, and clostridium difficile. a dysbiosis has been repeatedly observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. instability of the dominant microbiota and decreased biodiversity (especially in the firmicutes  phylum) are major characteristics. the decrease of faecalibacterium prausnitzii seems to have a prognostic value to predict relapse of crohn's disease after surgery. finally, important perspectives are opened by new tools such as metagenomics and metabolomics of the gastrointestinal ecosystems. major tracks concern irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer and obesity.

TI  == intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis b virus infection. intestinal microbiota of hbv cirrhotic patients.
AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == molecular analysis of the digestive microbiota in a gnotobiotic mouse model during antibiotic treatment: influence of saccharomyces boulardii.
AB  == the probiotic saccharomyces boulardii is a non-pathogenic yeast that has been proven efficient in the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea and of clostridium difficile associated colitis. we evaluated the influence of the administration of s. boulardii on the composition of the fecal microbiota in a human microbiota-associated mouse model. this evaluation was run before, during and after a 7-day oral treatment with amoxicillin clavulanic acid. predominant groups of bacteria were quantified with fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry using group-specific 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes designed for the eubacteria, bacteroides-porphyromonas-prevotella, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale,  faecalibacterium prausnitzii, clostridium histolyticum, lactobacillus-enterococcus and enterobacteriaceae groups and bifidobacterium species. s. boulardii did not quantitatively alter the total anaerobic microbiota nor the dominant bacterial groups. during the antibiotic treatment in the two groups of mice receiving the yeast or not, the level of enterobacteriaceae and bacteroides groups increased when the c. coccoides-e. rectale group decreased dramatically. after the antibiotic treatment was discontinued, the return to the  initial level was reached more rapidly in the s. boulardii-treated mice than in the control mice (p<0.05) for the c. coccoides-e. rectale and bacteroides-porphyromonas-prevotella groups. this quicker recovery of normal intestinal microbiota equilibrium after antibiotic therapy could be a mechanism for s. boulardii preventive effect on antibiotic-associated diarrhea in humans.
