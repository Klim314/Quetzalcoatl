TI  - Gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  - Wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. However, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. For this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 Gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis) were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. By applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. Many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; Mycobacterium bolletii, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The genus Treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. Using specific real-time PCR on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria Bartonella spp. Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. We estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. Therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.
TI  - Cyclodextrin derivatives as anti-infectives.
AB  - Cyclodextrin derivatives can be utilized as anti-infectives with pore-forming proteins as the targets. The highly efficient selection of potent inhibitors was achieved because per-substituted cyclodextrins have the same symmetry as the target pores. Inhibitors of several bacterial toxins produced by Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium difficile were identified from a library of approximately 200 CD derivatives. It was demonstrated that multi-targeted inhibitors can be found using this approach and could be utilized for the development of broad-spectrum drugs against various pathogens.
TI  - Rapid oligonucleotide suspension array-based multiplex detection of bacterial pathogens.
AB  - A gene-specific microsphere suspension array coupled with 15-plex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed to screen bacterial samples rapidly for 10 strains of bacteria: Shigella spp. (S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, and S. sonnei), Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae (serology O1 and O139), Legionella pneumophila, and Clostridium botulinum (types A, B, and E). Fifteen sets of highly validated primers were chosen to amplify target genes simultaneously. Corresponding oligonucleotide probes directly conjugated with microsphere sets were used to specifically identify PCR amplicons. Sensitivity tests revealed that the array coupled with single PCR was able to detect purified genomic DNA at concentrations as low as 10 copies/muL, while the multiplex detection limit was 10-10(4) copies/muL. The assay was validated using water samples artificially spiked with S. aureus and S. dysenteriae, as well as water specimens from swimming pools previously identified to contain S. aureus.
TI  - Management of microbial food safety in Arab countries.
AB  - Microbial food safety remains a major economic and public health concern in Arab  countries. Over the past several years, many of these countries have attempted to revise and upgrade food quality control and surveillance programs; however, these systems vary in scope and effectiveness. This review addresses the major reported foodborne outbreaks and multidrug resistance of pathogenic microorganisms isolated from food products. Major foodborne pathogens of concern included Brucella spp., Clostridium botulinum, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus. Measures for managing microbial food hazards based on a comprehensive risk analysis also are proposed.
TI  - Inhibition of macrophage migration by C. botulinum exoenzyme C3.
AB  - C3-like exoenzymes are produced by various microorganism including Clostridium botulinum (C3bot), Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. C3bot is the prototype of C3-like exoenzymes that specifically ADP-ribosylates and thereby inactivates Rho(A/B/C). C3-like exoenzymes are not yet regarded as virulence factors, as the lack of cell entry domains results in a poor accessibility of the C3-like exoenzymes to cells. In this study, the sensitivity of various cell lines to C3bot has been reinvestigated. Primary monocytes as well as cultured macrophage-like cells including J774A.1 cells and RAW macrophages exhibit a tenfold higher sensitivity to C3bot than fibroblasts and epithelial cells. RhoA ADP-ribosylation by C3bot resulted in the formation of pronounced bipolar protrusions based on defective tail retraction. The formation of bipolar protrusion resulted in inhibited macrophage migration. These findings suggested that macrophages appear to be target cells of C3bot. Migration of macrophage is a prerequiste for their recruitment to the site of pathogen invasion or tissue damage. Inhibition of macrophage migration likely preserves the survival of C3-producing microorganisms. The observations of this study reinforce the paradigm of a role of C3-like exoenzymes as virulence factors.
TI  - Bostrycin, a novel coupling agent for protein immobilization and prevention of biomaterial-centered infection produced by Nigrospora sp. No. 407.
AB  - Bostrycin, a red antibacterial agent with tetrahydroanthraquinone structure, has  been isolated from Nigrospora sp. No. 407. This study investigated the potential antibacterial and multifunctional properties of matrixes through immobilization of bostrycin on their surface for immobilization of protein and prevention of bacterial growth. Bostrycin was immobilized on nonwoven polypropylene (PP) fabric by a technique using glutaraldehyde and polyethyleneimine for the activation of the surface. Glucose oxidase immobilized on bostrycin-treated nonwoven PP fabric showed high activity. The immobilization process improved thermal stability of the enzymes. During repeated assay for 30 cycles, the enzyme activity dropped to only 70% of the initial activity. Both bostrycin-treated nonwoven PP fabric sample and subsequently immobilized glucose oxidase sample on the surface also still exhibited a bacteriostatic effect. This is the first study to show that bostrycin is a promising coupling agent for surface modification on matrix and its potential applications in protein immobilization and biomaterial-centered infection.
TI  - [The new microbiological hazards in food].
AB  - This paper describes the new microbiological hazards in food. For protecting human health, nowadays food safety authorities face with many challenges, that years ago were largely unheard. In 2011 verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli O104:H4 has been isolated in Germany. Strain came from fenugreek sprouts originated from Egypt. It was characterized by unique features such as presence of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli genes (aatA, aggR, aap, aggA, aggC) and resistance to most antibiotics. In Poland only three cases of disease caused by O104:H4 strain have been reported. Another emergence pathogen in Poland is Yersinia enterocolitica 08, biotype 1B. It is the most pathogenic bioserotype recently isolated in the USA only. Food-borne is commonly associated with raw or undercooked pork. The source of Yersinia spp. may be also milk and water. The presence ofbotulinum neurotoxins in food is not new, but still an important issue because of their high toxicity to human. Botulinum neurotoxins are high-molecular thermolabile proteins produced by Clostridium botulinum and some strains of Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium baratii. Based on their antigenic properties, botulin neurotoxins are divided into seven types A-G, however only types A, B, E and F are toxic to humans and some animals. Increasing risk associated with food results from antimicrobial resistance eg. extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing bacteria, particularly Enterobacteriaceae. Until recently strains ESBL+ were isolated in hospitals, however during last years they have been isolated from healthy humans, animals and food of animal origin. Increasingly common microbiological hazard in food is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although prevalence of this pathogen in food is not high, the thread comes from difficulties of treating of infections caused by MRSA. The occurrence of food-borne in humans may also be associated with presence of viruses in food and water. The carrier of viruses may be equipment in food plant, production line, packaging and man. Most food-borne are caused by noroviruses, rotaviruses, hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E virus. An increased number of food-borne viral outbreaks are recorded in several countries. Reasons for this include the improved diagnostic methods that have enhanced detection of some virus groups, and the increased marketing of fresh and frozen foods that has led to a worldwide availability of high risk food. Viruses may contaminate food either through contamination at source, principally through sewage pollution of the environment, or in association with food
TI  - Partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two Lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
AB  - The probiotic characteristics of Lactobacillus brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33, isolated from traditional Turkish Tulum cheese were assessed. These two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg mL(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg mL(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at pH 2. They were also adhered to Caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to Escherichia coli LMG3083 (ETEC) and Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344. The strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature, and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. The bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Tricine-SDS-PAGE of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kDA and 2.7 kDA for Lb. brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33 bacteriocins, respectively.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - Regulation of neurotoxin production and sporulation by a Putative agrBD signaling system in proteolytic Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - A significant number of genome sequences of Clostridium botulinum and related species have now been determined. In silico analysis of these data revealed the presence of two distinct agr loci (agr-1 and agr-2) in all group I strains, each encoding putative proteins with similarity to AgrB and AgrD of the well-studied Staphylococcus aureus agr quorum sensing system. In S. aureus, a small diffusible autoinducing peptide is generated from AgrD in a membrane-located processing event that requires AgrB. Here the characterization of both agr loci in the group I strain C. botulinum ATCC 3502 and of their homologues in a close relative, Clostridium sporogenes NCIMB 10696, is reported. In C. sporogenes NCIMB 10696, agr-1 and agr-2 appear to form transcriptional units that consist of agrB, agrD, and flanking genes of unknown function. Several of these flanking genes are conserved in Clostridium perfringens. In agreement with their proposed role in quorum sensing, both loci were maximally expressed during late-exponential-phase growth. Modulation of agrB expression in C. sporogenes was achieved using antisense RNA, whereas in C. botulinum, insertional agrD mutants were generated using ClosTron technology. In comparison to the wild-type strains, these strains exhibited drastically reduced sporulation and, for C. botulinum, also reduced production of neurotoxin, suggesting that both phenotypes are controlled by quorum sensing. Interestingly, while agr-1 appeared to control sporulation, agr-2 appeared to regulate neurotoxin formation.
TI  - Bacterial toxins induce sustained mRNA expression of the silencing transcription  factor klf2 via inactivation of RhoA and Rhophilin 1.
AB  - Yersiniae bearing the Yersinia virulence plasmid pYV impact the transcriptome of  J774A.1 macrophage-like cells in two distinct ways: (i) by suppressing, in a Yersinia outer protein P (YopP)-dependent manner, the induction of inflammatory response genes and (ii) by mRNA induction of the silencing transcription factor klf2. Here we show that klf2 induction by Yersinia enterocolitica occurs in several cell lines of macrophage and squamous and upper gastrointestinal epithelial origin as well as in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Several strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are equally effective as Y. enterocolitica in inducing klf2 expression. Screening of mutant strains or incubation with recombinant toxins identified the rho-inactivating toxins YopT from Yersinia spp., ExoS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, EDIN-B from Staphylococcus aureus, and C3bot from Clostridium botulinum as bacterial inducers of klf2 mRNA. klf2 mRNA induction by these toxins does not require de novo protein synthesis. Serum response factor or actin depolymerization does not seem to be involved in regulating klf2 expression in response to bacterial infection. Instead, short hairpin RNA-mediated inactivation of RhoA and its effector rhophilin 1 is sufficient to induce long-term klf2 expression. Thus, bacteria exploit the RhoA-rhophilin signaling cascade to mediate sustained expression of the immunosuppressive transcription factor klf2.
TI  - Evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. METHODS: An evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. Scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). The scoring procedure was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. Independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. The zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. RESULTS: The following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli. A second group of "significant importance" included Toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus, Cryptosporidium parvum, Mycobacterium bovis, Echinococcus granulosus, Streptococcus spp., Echinococcus multilocularis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Mycobacterium avium, Fasciola hepatica, Giardia intestinalis, and Rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. APPLICATIONS: These results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. They also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. Principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.
TI  - Rapid detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples by an improved reverse dot blot method.
AB  - AIM: To develop a new, rapid and accurate reverse dot blot (RDB) method for the detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples. METHODS: The 12 intestinal pathogens tested were Salmonella spp., Brucella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The two universal primers were designed to amplify two variable regions of bacterial 16S and 23S rDNA genes from all of the 12 bacterial species tested. Five hundred and forty fecal samples from the diarrhea patients were detected using the improved RDB assay. RESULTS: The methods could identify the 12 intestinal pathogens specifically, and the detection limit was as low as 103 CFUs. The consistent detection rate of the improved RDB assay compared with the traditional culture method was up to 88.75%. CONCLUSION: The hybridization results indicated that the improved RDB assay developed was a reliable method for the detection of intestinal pathogen in fecal samples.
TI  - [Microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in Costa Rica].
AB  - Microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in Costa Rica. Unrefined cristalised cane sugar, obtained after the filtration and evaporation of sugar cane juice, is a nutritional product of traditional consumption in Costa Rica and other Neotropical countries. It has been used in the topic treatment of infected wounds, with satisfactory results even with some antibiotic-ressistant bacteria. We studied the microbiological quality of 50 commercial samples. The analyses included total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria plate count; aerobic and anaerobic spore count; mold and yeast count; total and fecal coliforms; and presence of Clostridium botulinum. The antimicrobial effect was tested for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), S. epidermidis (UCR 2902), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19116) and Aspergillus niger (Asni 06). Most of the samples (76%) presented counts lower than 100 CFU/g especially for sporulated forms (90% lower than 20 CFU/g), the mold and yeast count was higher (38% higher than 10(2) CFU/g), demonstrating the importance of these microorganisms in the spoilage of the product; 76% of the samples presented fecal contamination; C. botulinum was not isolated with the methodology employed. No inhibitory effect was observed for A. niger, but all samples han an inhibitory effect over the other species, especially for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
TI  - Listeriolysin S, a novel peptide haemolysin associated with a subset of lineage I Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - Streptolysin S (SLS) is a bacteriocin-like haemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor that plays a key role in the virulence of Group A Streptococcus (GAS), the causative agent of pharyngitis, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Although it has long been thought that SLS and related peptides are produced by GAS and related streptococci only, there is evidence to suggest that a number of the most notorious Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum and Staphylococcus aureus, produce related peptides. The distribution of the L. monocytogenes cluster is particularly noteworthy in that it is found exclusively among a subset of lineage I strains; i.e., those responsible for the majority of outbreaks of listeriosis. Expression of these genes results in the production of a haemolytic and cytotoxic factor, designated Listeriolysin S, which contributes to virulence of the pathogen as assessed by murine- and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil-based studies. Thus, in the process of establishing the existence of an extended family of SLS-like modified virulence peptides (MVPs), the genetic basis for the enhanced virulence of a proportion of lineage I L. monocytogenes may have been revealed.
TI  - Crystal structure of the Clostridium limosum C3 exoenzyme.
AB  - C3-like toxins ADP-ribosylate and inactivate Rho GTPases. Seven C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases produced by Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium limosum, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus were identified and two representatives--C3bot from C. botulinum and C3stau2 from S. aureus--were crystallized. Here we present the 1.8A structure of C. limosum C3 transferase C3lim and compare it to the structures of other family members. In contrast to the structure of apo-C3bot, the canonical ADP-ribosylating turn turn motif is observed in a primed conformation, ready for NAD binding. This suggests an impact on the binding mode of NAD and on the transferase reaction. The crystal structure explains why auto-ADP-ribosylation of C3lim at Arg41 interferes with the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the toxin.
TI  - Sterilization efficiency of a cascaded dielectric barrier discharge.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the microbial inactivation efficiency of a newly developed cascaded dielectric barrier discharge (CDBD) set-up against various micro-organisms on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foils. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inactivation kinetics in dependency of time were produced with air as process gas and test strains like Salmonella serotype Mons, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and spores of Bacillus atrophaeus, Aspergillus niger and Clostridium botulinum, which were homogeneously distributed on the sample surface by a spray method. Highest count reduction was observed for the vegetative cells with at least 6.6 log(10) within 1 s. Aspergillus niger was the most resistant test strain with an inactivation rate of about 5 log(10) in 5 s. CONCLUSIONS: For industrial applications it is necessary to evaluate new sterilization methods against a broad range of different micro-organisms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: CDBD plasma is a fast and effective technology for decontamination of heat sensitive materials in few seconds.
TI  - Amino acid and nucleotide sequence, adjacent genes, and heterologous expression of hiracin JM79, a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus hirae DCH5, isolated from Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).
AB  - The primary structure of a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus hirae DCH5 was determined by combined amino acid and DNA sequencing. Nucleotide analysis of a 2838-bp DNA fragment of E. hirae DCH5 revealed five putative ORFs. The first orf (hirJM79) encodes a 74-amino-acid peptide containing an N-terminal signal peptide of 30 amino acids, followed by the amino acid sequence of the mature bacteriocin, hiracin JM79 (HirJM79), of 44 amino acids. The second orf (hiriJM79) encodes the putative immunity protein of HirJM79. Contiguous ORFs encode a putative mobilization protein (orfC), a relaxase/mobilization nuclease domain (orfD), and a hypothetical protein (orfE). The production and functional expression of HirJM79 by heterologous hosts suggest that hirJM79 is the minimum requirement for production of biologically active HirJM79, that HirJM79 is most likely externalized by the general secretory pathway or sec-dependent pathway, and that HiriJM79 is the immunity protein for HirJM79.
TI  - [Foodborne infections and intoxications in Poland in 2004].
AB  - A total of 19 870 bacterial foodborne infections and intoxications were registered in 2004 (incidence 52.0/100,000 population). These illnesses were less incident in 2004, compared both to 2003 figure (20 221 cases) and the median 1998-2002 (26 734 cases). Unlike bacterial infections, the incidence of viral foodborne infections increased in the recent years (2004 - 27.2 vs. 2003 -21.1 and median 1998-2002 - 10.0). The parasitic foodborne infections did not change much during the recent years. A total of 156 cases of mushroom poisonings were reported (incidence 0,4) in 2004, compared to 78 cases in 2003, 66 cases in 2002 and a median of 223 cases in 1998-2001 (incidence 0.6). There were 13 deaths related to foodborne infections or intoxications registered in 2004, of which the following etiologic agents were established: Salmonella Enteritidis (2) Clostridium botulinum (2), Streptococcus aureus (1), other bacteria (6), and E. multilocularis infestation (2). A total of 347 foodborne and waterborne outbreaks involving 5 920 cases were reported in 2004 (only outbreaks involving 4 persons or more). The most prevalent etiological factors in outbreaks were Salmonella strains (50.0% of cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6.5% of cases) and Escherichia coli (4.6% of cases). In 28% of outbreaks involving 31.2% cases no etiological factor was established. The most prevalent Salmonella strain were S. Enteritidis (95,1% cases) and S. Typhimurium (1.7%). The main vehicle of foodborne and waterborne outbreaks were meals prepared from various (>2) raw materials of animal sources (33.1% of cases) and meals from eggs (20.3%). Of the places of food contamination, the most prevalent were own apartments (24.8% of outbreaks), food producing farms (8,1%), and restaurants (8,1%). The three largest outbreaks (two caused by S. Enteritidis and one by S. aureus) involved 576 cases, of which 26 were hospitalized.
TI  - [Modulation of molecular signaling mechanisms in excitable cells by toxins and bacterial substances].
AB  - The mechanisms of bacterial substances (protein A, peptidoglican Staphylococcus aureus), bacterium toxins (St. aureus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Shigella dysenteriae, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tetani, Vibrio choleral), transfer factor of immune reactivity to Staphylococcus aureus upon the key link (acetylcholine-, ATP-, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate-, ryanodin-sensitive receptors, G-proteins, Ca2+, K(+)-transporting systems, second messengers) in the chain of signal conduction of excitatory and inhibitory agonists in excitable cells were examined. The action of these immune-active substances upon contractile proteins ATP-ase activity and protein synthesis was also discussed.
TI  - Exchange of glutamine-217 to glutamate of Clostridium limosum exoenzyme C3 turns  the asparagine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase into an arginine-modifying enzyme.
AB  - C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferaseses are produced by Clostridium species, Bacillus cereus, and various Staphylococcus aureus strains. The exoenzymes modify the low-molecular-mass GTPases RhoA, B, and C. In structural studies of C3-like exoenzymes, an ARTT-motif (ADP-ribosylating turn-turn motif) was identified that appears to be involved in substrate specificity and recognition (Han, S., Arvai, A. S., Clancy, S. B., Tainer, J. A. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 305, 95-107). Exchange of Gln217, which is a key residue of the ARTT-motif, to Glu in C3 from Clostridium limosum results in inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity toward RhoA. The mutant protein is still capable of NAD-binding and possesses NAD+ glycohydrolase activity. Whereas recombinant wild-type C3 modifies Rho proteins specifically at an asparagine residue (Asn41), Gln217Glu-C3 is capable of ADP-ribosylation of poly-arginine but not poly-asparagine. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, a model substrate for many arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases, is modified by the Gln217Glu-C3 transferase. Also in C3 ADP-ribosyltransferases from Clostridium botulinum and B. cereus, the exchange of the equivalent Gln residue to Glu blocked asparagine modification of RhoA but elicited arginine-specific ADP-ribosylation. Moreover, the Gln217Glu-C3lim transferase was able to ADP-ribosylate recombinant wild-type C3lim at Arg86, resulting in decrease in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the wild-type enzyme. The data indicate that the exchange of one amino acid residue in the ARTT-motif turns the asparagine-modifying ADP-ribosyltransferases of the C3 family into arginine-ADP-ribosylating transferases.
TI  - Detection of biological threat agents by real-time PCR: comparison of assay performance on the R.A.P.I.D., the LightCycler, and the Smart Cycler platforms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid detection of biological threat agents is critical for timely therapeutic administration. Fluorogenic PCR provides a rapid, sensitive, and specific tool for molecular identification of these agents. We compared the performance of assays for 7 biological threat agents on the Idaho Technology, Inc. R.A.P.I.D., the Roche LightCycler, and the Cepheid Smart Cycler. METHODS: Real-time PCR primers and dual-labeled fluorogenic probes were designed to detect Bacillus anthracis, Brucella species, Clostridium botulinum, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia pestis. DNA amplification assays were optimized by use of Idaho Technology buffers and deoxynucleotide triphosphates supplemented with Invitrogen Platinum Taq DNA polymerase, and were subsequently tested for sensitivity and specificity on the R.A.P.I.D., the LightCycler, and the Smart Cycler. RESULTS: Limit of detection experiments indicated that assay performance was comparable among the platforms tested. Exclusivity and inclusivity testing with a general bacterial nucleic acid cross-reactivity panel containing 60 DNAs and agent-specific panels containing nearest neighbors for the organisms of interest indicated that all assays were specific for their intended targets. CONCLUSION: With minor supplementation, such as the addition of Smart Cycler Additive Reagent to the Idaho Technology buffers, assays for DNA templates from biological threat agents demonstrated similar performance, sensitivity, and specificity on all 3 platforms.
TI  - [Evaluation of the antimicrobial action of honey against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Listeria monocytogenes and Aspergillus niger. Evaluation of its microbiological charge].
AB  - The evaluation of the microbiological charge present in Costa Rican samples as the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity over different microorganisms, including those associated to wound infections, will allow to emit criteria referred to its use in therapeutic treatments, specially as alternative therapy for cases involving antibiotic resistant bacteria. The microbiological charge of 25 honey samples, acquired in Costa Rican markets was evaluated through several indicators including total plate aerobic count, total plate anaerobic count, total aerobic spore count, total anaerobic spore count and molds and yeast count. Also, samples were inoculated in tubes with chopped meat media and plated in egg yolk agar in order to determine the presence of Clostridium botulinum. For the antimicrobial activity evaluation, the diffusion method in Muller Hinton agar was performed, testing different honey concentrations (100, 75, 50, 25, 12,5 and 6,25 % v/v) against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (UCR 2902), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19116) and Aspergillus niger. The results obtained for the microbiological characterization of honey show that 91% of samples had counts equal or lower than 1,0 x 10(1) CFU/g. No positive result was obtained for the isolation of C. botulinum. 24 of the samples analyzed inhibited the growth of S. aureus even in a 25% v/v concentration, nevertheless, A. niger was no inhibited by any of the samples tested.
TI  - The incidence rate of bacterial food poisonings in the Lublin province in the years 1976-1998.
AB  - The aim of the paper was to analyse the bacterial poisonings in the Lublin province in the years 1976-1998. The analysis was based on the archive materials of the Regional Unit for Control of Epidemics and Hygiene Promotion in Lublin. To illustrate the discussed issues the exemplifying bacterial food poisonings in closed mass nutrition institutions in 1990 were examined. The studies revealed that the bacterial food poisonings were most frequently caused by Salmonella enteritidis and one of the basic carriers was the food prepared from animal-derived materials. The incidence of Salmonella infections is constantly growing while that of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum infections is decreasing. In 1990 closed mass nutrition institutions in which the poisonings occurred had positive pre-infection sanitary scores, according to the hygiene classification sheet, which suggests that their staff followed the sanitary and hygienic regulations on an irregular basis.
TI  - Molecular recognition of an ADP-ribosylating Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme by RalA GTPase.
AB  - C3 exoenzymes (members of the ADP-ribosyltranferase family) are produced by Clostridium botulinum (C3bot1 and -2), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), Bacillus cereus (C3cer), and Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau1-3). These exoenzymes lack a translocation domain but are known to specifically inactivate Rho GTPases in host target cells. Here, we report the crystal structure of C3bot1 in complex with RalA (a GTPase of the Ras subfamily) and GDP at a resolution of 2.66 A. RalA is not ADP-ribosylated by C3 exoenzymes but inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3bot1, C3lim, and C3cer to different extents. The structure provides an insight into the molecular interactions between C3bot1 and RalA involving the catalytic ADP-ribosylating turn-turn (ARTT) loop from C3bot1 and helix alpha4 and strand beta6 (which are not part of the GDP-binding pocket) from RalA. The structure also suggests a molecular explanation for the different levels of C3-exoenzyme inhibition by RalA and why RhoA does not bind C3bot1 in this manner.
TI  - Identification of SpyA, a novel ADP-ribosyltransferase of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, the aetiological agent of both respiratory and skin infections, produces numerous exotoxins to establish infection. This report identifies a new exotoxin produced by this organism, termed SpyA, for S. pyogenesADP-ribosylating toxin. SpyA, MW 24.9, has amino acid identity with the ADP-riboslytransferases (ADPRTs) Staphylococcus aureus EDIN and Clostridium botulinum C3. Recombinant SpyA was able to hydrolyse beta-NAD(+), and this activity was dependent on a glutamate at position 187. SpyA has a putative biglutamate active site, and similar to most biglutamate ADPRTs, was able to ADP-ribosylate poly-l-arginine. SpyA modified numerous proteins in both CHO and HeLa cell lysates. Two-dimesional gel analysis and MALDI-TOF MS analysis of modified proteins indicated that vimentin, tropomyosin and actin, all cytoskeletal proteins, are targets. Expression of spyA in HeLa cells resulted in loss of actin microfilaments. We hypothesize that SpyA is produced by S. pyogenes to disrupt cytoskeletal structures and promote colonization of the host.
TI  - Phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB  - Comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. This process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial DNA. Many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. Two situations can be distinguished: Vibrio cholerae, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. These prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. Prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile DNA elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. Prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. In many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific DNA sequences. In addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. The current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Differential effects of Rho GTPases on axonal and dendritic development in hippocampal neurones.
AB  - Formation of neurites and their differentiation into axons and dendrites requires precisely controlled changes in the cytoskeleton. While small GTPases of the Rho family appear to be involved in this regulation, it is still unclear how Rho function affects axonal and dendritic growth during development. Using hippocampal neurones at defined states of differentiation, we have dissected the function of RhoA in axonal and dendritic growth. Expression of a dominant negative RhoA variant inhibited axonal growth, whereas dendritic growth was promoted. The opposite phenotype was observed when a constitutively active RhoA variant was expressed. Inactivation of Rho by C3-catalysed ADP-ribosylation using C3 isoforms (Clostridium limosum, C3(lim) or Staphylococcus aureus, C3(stau2)), diminished axonal branching. By contrast, extracellularly applied nanomolar concentrations of C3 from C. botulinum (C3(bot)) or enzymatically dead C3(bot) significantly increased axon growth and axon branching. Taken together, axonal development requires activation of RhoA, whereas dendritic development benefits from its inactivation. However, extracellular application of enzymatically active or dead C3(bot) exclusively promotes axonal growth and branching suggesting a novel neurotrophic function of C3 that is independent from its enzymatic activity.
TI  - Homology modeling and molecular dynamics studies of a novel C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferase.
AB  - The novel C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferase is produced by a Staphylococcus aureus strain that especially ADP-ribosylates RhoE/Rnd3 subtype proteins, and its three-dimensional (3D) structure has not known. In order to understand the catalytic mechanism, the 3D structure of the protein is built by using homology modeling based on the known crystal structure of exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium botulinum (1G24). Then the model structure is further refined by energy minimization and molecular dynamics methods. The putative nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-binding pocket of exoenzyme C3(Stau) is determined by Binding-Site Search module. The NAD(+)-enzyme complex is developed by molecular dynamics simulation and the key residues involved in the combination of enzyme binding to the ligand-NAD(+) are determined, which is helpful to guide the experimental realization and the new mutant designs as well. Our results indicated that the key binding-site residues of Arg48, Glu180, Ser138, Asn134, Arg85, and Gln179 play an important role in the catalysis of exoenzyme C3(Stau), which is in consistent with experimental observation.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the bactericidal effects of Japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. Konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the pH of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). Konjac fluids completely inactivated Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 and E. coil O26:H9, Salmonella Enteritidis, Vibrio parahemolyticus. and Staphylococcus aureus. The initial level of 6 log CFU/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable S. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. On the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum type E and type A). At least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. Vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. When the initial cell count was 6 log CFU/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected after 120 days. When the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log CFU/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within I to 3 days. Repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. Our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.
TI  - Evaluation of survival of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum in charqui meats.
AB  - Charqui meats were prepared in laboratory conditions in order to carry out experiments to observe the possibility of development of enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum proteolytic type B spores and their toxins. Results demonstrated that the harsh processing conditions, high salt concentration, relative high temperature, a(w) values, inhibited the growth of both bacteria. Under our experimental conditions, S. aureus would survive throughout the sequence of salting steps i.e. brine followed by rock salting and the sunshine drying step. However, at final a(w) value of 0.70-0.75 would create conditions to inhibit its development. The other experiment revealed that C. botulinum spores germination also was impaired because of these low a(w) values. Under these conditions, charqui meats revealed to be safe products in relation to toxins from both enterotoxigenic S. aureus and C. botulinum.
TI  - The crystal structure of C3stau2 from Staphylococcus aureus and its complex with  NAD.
AB  - The C3stau2 exoenzyme from Staphylococcus aureus is a C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferase that ADP-ribosylates not only RhoA-C but also RhoE/Rnd3. In this study we have crystallized and determined the structure of C3stau2 in both its native form and in complex with NAD at 1.68- and 2.02-A resolutions, respectively. The topology of C3stau2 is similar to that of C3bot1 from Clostridium botulinum (with which it shares 35% amino acid sequence identity) with the addition of two extra helices after strand beta1. The native structure also features a novel orientation of the catalytic ARTT loop, which approximates the conformation seen for the "NAD bound" form of C3bot1. C3stau2 orients NAD similarly to C3bot1, and on binding NAD, C3stau2 undergoes a clasping motion and a rearrangement of the phosphate-nicotinamide binding loop, enclosing the NAD in the binding site. Comparison of these structures with those of C3bot1 and related toxins reveals a degree of divergence in the interactions with the adenine moiety among the ADP-ribosylating toxins that contrasts with the more conserved interactions with the nicotinamide. Comparison with C3bot1 gives some insight into the different protein substrate specificities of these enzymes.
TI  - Rho-specific Bacillus cereus ADP-ribosyltransferase C3cer cloning and characterization.
AB  - C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases represent an expanding family of related exoenzymes, which are produced by Clostridia and various Staphylococcus aureus strains. Here we report on the cloning and biochemical characterization of an ADP-ribosyltransferase from Bacillus cereus strain 2339. The transferase encompasses 219 amino acids; it has a predicted mass of 25.2 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 9.3. To indicate the relationship to the family of C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases, we termed the enzyme C3cer. The amino acid sequence of C3cer is 30 to 40% identical to other C3-like exoenzymes. By site-directed mutagenesis, Arg(59), Arg(97), Tyr(151), Arg(155), Thr(178), Tyr(180), Gln(183), and Glu(185) of recombinant C3cer were identified as pivotal residues of enzyme activity and/or protein substrate recognition. Precipitation experiments with immobilized RhoA revealed that C3cerTyr(180), which is located in the so-called "ADP-ribosylating toxin turn-turn" (ARTT) motif, plays a major role in the recognition of RhoA. Like other C3-like exoenzymes, C3cer ADP-ribosylates preferentially RhoA and RhoB and to a much lesser extent RhoC. Because the cellular accessibility of recombinant C3cer is low, a fusion toxin (C2IN-C3cer), consisting of the N-terminal 225 amino acid residues of the enzyme component of C2 toxin from Clostridium botulinum and C3cer was used to study the cytotoxic effects of the transferase. This fusion toxin caused rounding up of Vero cells comparable to the effects of Rho-inactivating toxins.
TI  - Biological toxins as potential agents of bioterrorism.
AB  
TI  - An investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  - In 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the UK and Ireland was reported and Clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to C. botulinum and Bacillus cereus were also reported. Because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in England during 2000 and 2002. Two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. The first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (MRD) which was inoculated directly into Clostridium Botulinum Isolation Cooked Meat Broth (CBI). The second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in CBI broth. Duplicate CBI broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees C for 30 min. Subcultures were made after incubation for 7 and 14 days on to eight different solid media. The methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either C. botulinum or C. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. Fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the MRD suspension technique. Fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. No fungi were isolated. Aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (Bacillus spp. and Paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at least one species was isolated from each sample. B. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with B. licheniformis isolated from 40%. Between one and five samples yielded cultures of B. coagulans, B. laterosporus, B. pumilus, B. subtilis and P. macerans. Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; S. warneri and S. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. One or two samples yielded cultures of S. aureus, S. capitis and S. haemolyticus. The remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with C. perfringens and two samples with either C. sordellii or C. tertium. Multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the remaining 15. In 13 samples B. cereus alone was isolated, in one B. subtilis alone and in one sample B. pumilus alone. C. botulinum and C. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. Recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.
TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of biological warfare agents using time-resolved fluorescence assays.
AB  - We have achieved sensitive, rapid and reproducible detection of three biological  threat agents in a variety of biological and environmental matrices using the DELFIA time-resolved fluorometry (TRF) assay system (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Akron, OH). Existing ELISA assays for the detection of Francisella tularensis, Clostridium botulinum A/B neurotoxin (BotNT A/B), and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) were converted to TRF assays. They use 100 microl of positive control or unknown per test well and require just over 2 h to run. Fluorescent signal read time is a fraction of a second per well. The assay format consists of a capture ELISA utilizing a biotinylated capture antibody, prebound to a streptavidin-coated 96-well plate and a lanthanide (Europium, Eu3+)-labeled detector antibody. The bound Eu-labeled detector antibody produces a fluorescent signal upon the addition of an enhancement solution. The signal results from the dissociation of the Europium from the antibody, creating a micelle, thus amplifying the signal nearly one million-fold. Sensitivities achieved by these assays were between 4 and 20 pg/ml in buffer. Additionally, we have tested this system in different matrices such as serum, urine, dirt, and sewage. Concentration curves generated from standard solutions produced a wide linear range making serial dilutions of unknown samples unnecessary. DELFIA TRF assays are significantly better in terms of sensitivity, linear range, and run time than standard capture ELISAs and should facilitate early detection of potential biological warfare agents in clinical and environmental samples.
TI  - Interaction of the Rho-ADP-ribosylating C3 exoenzyme with RalA.
AB  - RhoA, -B, and -C are ADP-ribosylated and biologically inactivated by Clostridium  botulinum C3 exoenzyme and related C3-like transferases. We report that RalA GTPase, which is not ADP-ribosylated by C3, inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3 from C. botulinum (C3bot), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), and Bacillus cereus (C3cer) but not from Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau) in human platelet membranes and rat brain lysate. Inhibition by RalA occurs with the GDP- and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-bound forms of RalA and is overcome by increasing concentrations of C3. A direct interaction of RalA with C3 was verified by precipitation of the transferase with GST-RalA-Sepharose. The affinity constant (K(d)) of the binding of RalA to C3lim was 12 nm as determined by fluorescence titration. RalA increased the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot by about 5-fold. Although RalA had no effect on glucosylation of Rho GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin B, C3bot and C3lim inhibited glucosylation of RalA by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. Furthermore, C3bot decreased activation of phospholipase D by RalA. The data indicate that several C3 exoenzymes directly interact with RalA without ADP-ribosylating the GTPase. The interaction is of high affinity and interferes with essential functions of C3 and RalA.
TI  - Microbial risks in mild hot smoking of fish.
AB  - Hot smoked fish should fulfill the requirements set up for ready-to-eat foods. The total bacterial count on the raw material is 10(3) to 10(5) CFU per cm2 of skin and 10(2) to 10(9) CFU per gram of intestines. Contamination with pathogenic bacteria is very low, mainly with Clostridium botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. In the premises of low hygiene, the contamination may increase due to unsanitary procedures, rotation of assigned duties of workers, and airborne microorganisms during packing of the product. Hot smoking in mild conditions at temperature in the fish not exceeding 65 degrees C and low concentration of salt does not inactivate all pathogens or inhibit bacteria during storage. Thus the required safety can be obtained only by using very fresh fish handled in hygienic conditions, controlling the processing and the plant hygiene in critical control points, and chilling of the product to about 2 degrees C. Most critical are the hygienic conditions in handling of the product after smoking. The use of preservatives for extending the shelf life of smoked fish is being investigated. High-quality shelf life of mild hot smoked mackerel at about 2 degrees C is at least 3 weeks.
TI  - Structure-function analysis of the Rho-ADP-ribosylating exoenzyme C3stau2 from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Exoenzyme C3stau2 from Staphylococcus aureus is a new member of the family of C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases that ADP-ribosylates RhoA, -B, and -C. Additionally, it modifies RhoE and Rnd3. Here we report on studies of the structure-function relationship of recombinant C3stau2 by site-directed mutagenesis. Exchange of Glu(180) with leucine caused a complete loss of both ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activity. By contrast, exchange of the glutamine residue two positions upstream (Gln(178)) with lysine blocked ADP-ribosyltransferase activity without major changes in NAD glycohydrolase activity. NAD and substrate binding of this mutant protein was comparable to that of the recombinant wild type. Exchange of amino acid Tyr(175), which is part of the recently described "ADP-ribosylating toxin turn-turn" (ARTT) motif [Han, S., Arvai, A. S., Clancy, S. B., and Tainer, J. A. (2001) J. Mol.Biol. 305, 95-107], with alanine, lysine, or threonine caused a loss of or a decrease in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity but an increase in NAD glycohydrolase activity. Recombinant C3stau2 Tyr175Ala and Tyr175Lys were not precipitated by matrix-bound Rho, supporting a role of Tyr(175) in protein substrate recognition. Exchange of Arg(48) and/or Arg(85) resulted in a 100-fold reduced transferase activity, while the recombinant C3stau2 double mutant R48K/R85K was totally inactive. The data indicate that amino acid residues Arg(48), Arg(85), Tyr(175), Gln(178), and Glu(180) are essential for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of recombinant C3stau2 and support the role of the ARTT motif in substrate recognition of RhoA by C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases.
TI  - C3stau, a new member of the family of C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases.
AB  - C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases, which are produced by Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium limosum, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, are exoenzymes lacking a translocation unit. These enzymes specifically inactivate Rho GTPases in host target cells. Recently, a novel C3-like transferase from S. aureus with new properties was identified, raising questions regarding its function. As Rho GTPases are master regulators of several eukaryotic signal processes and S. aureus can invade eukaryotic cells, C3 might play a role as a virulence factor.
TI  - The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) generic model for the production of Thai fermented pork sausage (Nham).
AB  - Nham is a traditional Thai fermented pork sausage. The major ingredients of Nham  are ground pork meat and shredded pork rind. Nham has been reported to be contaminated with Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Therefore, it is a potential cause of foodborne diseases for consumers. A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) generic model has been developed for the Nham process. Nham processing plants were observed and a generic flow diagram of Nham processes was constructed. Hazard analysis was then conducted. Other than microbial hazards, the pathogens previously found in Nham, sodium nitrite and metal were identified as chemical and physical hazards in this product, respectively. Four steps in the Nham process have been identified as critical control points. These steps are the weighing of the nitrite compound, stuffing, fermentation, and labeling. The chemical hazard of nitrite must be controlled during the weighing step. The critical limit of nitrite levels in the Nham mixture has been set at 100-200 ppm. This level is high enough to control Clostridium botulinum but does not cause chemical hazards to the consumer. The physical hazard from metal clips could be prevented by visual inspection of every Nham product during stuffing. The microbiological hazard in Nham could be reduced in the fermentation process. The critical limit of the pH of Nham was set at lower than 4.6. Since this product is not cooked during processing, finally, educating the consumer, by providing information on the label such as "safe if cooked before consumption", could be an alternative way to prevent the microbiological hazards of this product.
TI  - Foodborne diseases in Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in Kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Forty two districts in Kenya between 1970 and 1993. STUDY SUBJECTS: Foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. RESULTS: Thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. Foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. A high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. CONCLUSION: Under-reporting, inadequate investigation of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease outbreaks are more than is recorded by the Ministry of Health.
TI  - A novel C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferase from Staphylococcus aureus modifying RhoE  and Rnd3.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum C3 is the prototype of the family of the C3-like transferases that ADP-ribosylate exclusively RhoA, -B and -C. The ADP-ribose at Asn-41 results in functional inactivation of Rho reflected by disaggregation of the actin cytoskeleton. We report on a new C3-like transferase produced by a pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus strain. The transferase designated C3(Stau) was cloned from the genomic DNA. At the amino acid level, C3(Stau) revealed an identity of 35% to C3 from C. botulinum and Clostridium limosum exoenzyme, respectively, and of 78% to EDIN from S. aureus. In addition to RhoA, which is the target of the other C3-like transferases, C3(Stau) modified RhoE and Rnd3. RhoE was ADP-ribosylated at Asn-44, which is equivalent to Asn-41 of RhoA. RhoE and Rnd3 are members of the Rho subfamily, which are deficient in intrinsic GTPase activity and possess a RhoA antagonistic cell function. The protein substrate specificity found with recombinant Rho proteins was corroborated by expression of RhoE in Xenopus laevis oocytes showing that RhoE was also modified in vivo by C3(Stau) but not by C3 from C. botulinum. The poor cell accessibility of C3(Stau) was overcome by generation of a chimeric toxin recruiting the cell entry machinery of C. botulinum C2 toxin. The chimeric C3(Stau) caused the same morphological and cytoskeletal changes as the chimeric C. botulinum C3. C3(Stau) is a new member of the family of the C3-like transferases but is also the prototype of a subfamily of RhoE/Rnd modifying transferases.
TI  - The development of immunoassays to four biological threat agents in a bidiffractive grating biosensor.
AB  - A critical need exists for a field deployable biosensor to detect environmental infectious agents in collected air samples rapidly, with sensitivity and specificity approaching that of standard laboratory procedures. The ideal sensor would analyze unknown samples in minutes, have programmable operation for unattended sample analysis, and be capable of multiple agent analysis for a number of agents. The goal of this project was to further the development of the bidiffractive grating biosensor (BDG) created through collaboration between Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI), Hoffman LaRoche (HLR), and the Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC). This manuscript details the development, optimization, and evaluation of this device as a potential field deployable biosensor. Well-characterized immunochemical reagents developed by the Biological Defense Research Department (BDRD) at NMRI were employed to develop assays in the BDG. These results were compared to those obtained with antigen capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Four separate antigens were evaluated: Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), ricin (RIC), Francisella tularensis (FT), and Clostridium botulinum toxin (BOT).
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - Food handlers and foodborne diseases: knowledge, attitudes, and reported behavior in Italy.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and behavior concerning foodborne diseases and food safety issues among food handlers in Italy. Face-to-face interviews were conducted within a random sample using a structured questionnaire. Of the 411 food handlers responding, 48.7% knew the main foodborne pathogens (Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae or other Vibrio spp., Clostridium botulinum, hepatitis A virus), and this knowledge was significantly greater among those with a higher education level, in practice from a longer period of time, and who had attended education courses (P < 0.05). A vast majority (90.4%) correctly indicated those foods classified as common vehicles for foodborne diseases, and only 7.1% of food handlers were able to name five different food vehicles, each of which transmit one of the five pathogens. The proportion of those who were able to specify a food vehicle that transmitted hepatitis A virus was significantly higher for those with a higher educational level and with a longer food-handling activity. A positive attitude toward foodborne diseases control and preventive measures was reported by the great majority of food handlers, and it was more likely achieved by those who had attended education courses. This attitude was not supported by some of the self-reported safe practices observed for hygienic principles, because only 20.8% used gloves when touching unwrapped raw food, and predictors of their use were educational level and attending education courses. Results strongly emphasize the need for educational programs for improving knowledge and control foodborne diseases.
TI  - Bacteria associated with processed crawfish and potential toxin production by Clostridium botulinum type E in vacuum-packaged and aerobically packaged crawfish tails.
AB  - Refrigerated vacuum-packaged storage has been shown to increase significantly the shelf life of fresh fish and seafood products, but the effect, if any, on the outgrowth and toxin production of Clostridium botulinum type E on cooked crawfish is unknown. Microflora associated with live crawfish reflect the microbial populations of the harvest water and sediments in which they are living. The presence or absence of specific pathogens in either vacuum-packaged or air-permeable bags of cooked crawfish have not been thoroughly evaluated. This study evaluates the potential survival and outgrowth of biological hazards in both vacuum-packaged and air-permeable-packaged cooked crawfish held at 4 and 10 degrees C for 30 days. During shelf-life studies of vacuum-packaged and air-permeable-bagged cooked crawfish, a total of 31 bacterial species were isolated and identified from crawfish samples using both selective and nonselective media. The only pathogens isolated from both vacuum-packed and air-permeable bags of processed crawfish samples during shelf-life studies were strains of Aeromonas hydrophila and Staphylococcus aureus. C. botulinum type E and Clostridium perfringens species were not isolated from any of the uninoculated crawfish samples. Cooked crawfish were inoculated with 10(3) C. botulinum type E spores per g of crawfish tail meat to determine whether cooked crawfish tails would support the growth of C. botulinum type E strains and produce toxin at refrigerated temperatures. Spore-inoculated crawfish tails were vacuum packaged in both a high barrier film and an air-permeable bag and stored at 4 degrees C and 10 degrees C for 30 days. C. botulinum toxin E was not detected in any of the spore-inoculated packages throughout the shelf-life study until day 30. Microbiological data from this study should be useful in the development and implementation of the hazard analysis and critical control point plans for processed crawfish tails.
TI  - Preformed bacterial toxins.
AB  - Food poisoning syndromes caused by four different bacteria are described. For all types, food kept at a permissive temperature allows growth of the vegetative forms of the bacteria and production of a toxin or toxins. The key features of these syndromes, as well as possible new trends of concern, are summarized in Table 1.
TI  - A review of analytical methods for the detection of bacterial toxins.
AB  
TI  - Biochemical and genetic characterization of enterocin P, a novel sec-dependent bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecium P13 with a broad antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  - Enterocin P is a new bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium P13 isolated from a Spanish dry-fermented sausage. Enterocin P inhibited most of tested spoilage and food-borne gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum. Enterocin P is produced during growth in MRS broth from 16 to 45 degrees C; it is heat resistant (60 min at 100 degrees C; 15 min at 121 degrees C) and can withstand exposure to pH between 2.0 and 11.0, freeze-thawing, lyophilization, and long-term storage at 4 and -20 degrees C. The bacteriocin was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, cation-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, and reverse-phase liquid chromatography. The sequence of 43 amino acids of the N terminus was obtained by Edman degradation. DNA sequencing analysis of a 755-bp region revealed the presence of two consecutive open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF encodes a 71-amino-acid protein containing a hydrophobic N-terminal sec-dependent leader sequence of 27 amino acids followed by the amino acid sequence corresponding to the purified and sequenced enterocin P. The bacteriocin is apparently synthesized as a prepeptide that is cleaved immediately after the Val-Asp-Ala residues (positions -3 to -1), resulting in the mature bacteriocin consisting of 44 amino acids, and with a theoretical molecular weight of 4,493. A second ORF, encoding a putative immunity protein composed of 88 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 9,886, was found immediately downstream of the enterocin P structural gene. Enterocin P shows a strong antilisterial activity and has the consensus sequence found in the pediocin-like bacteriocins; however, enterocin P is processed and secreted by the sec-dependent pathway.
TI  - Bacterial toxins block endothelial wound repair. Evidence that Rho GTPases control cytoskeletal rearrangements in migrating endothelial cells.
AB  - We investigated the effect of bacterial toxins that modify and inactivate Rho GTP-binding proteins on the migratory response of endothelial cells to wounding. C3-transferase from Clostridium botulinum, EDIN from Staphylococcus aureus, and toxin A from Clostridium difficile blocked migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in an in vitro wound repair assay. Migrating HUVECs expressed actin microspikes (maximum at 10 minutes after wounding), ruffles (maximum at 12 hours), and fibers (maximum at 24 hours), and within these actin structures, vinculin-containing focal complexes/adhesions were formed. C3-Transferase ADP ribosylated RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC in HUVECs and abolished the formation of actin stress fibers/focal adhesions but had no effect on expression of microspikes, ruffles, or the associated vinculin-containing focal complexes. Similar results were obtained with EDIN and toxin A. These results indicate that endothelial cells migrating into a wounded area express distinct combinations of actin/vinculin structures in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner. The GTPase Rho selectively controls the formation of actin fibers/focal adhesions that occurs 2 to 24 hours after wounding. A mechanism is proposed by which Rho-specific bacterial toxins could influence vascular repair, angiogenesis, or atherosclerosis.
TI  - A survey of bacterial toxins involved in food poisoning: a suggestion for bacterial food poisoning toxin nomenclature.
AB  - There is at present no accepted nomenclature for bacterial protein toxins, although there have been several attempts at dividing them into groups by their mode of action. In this paper we will not try to describe all known bacterial protein toxins, but concentrate on the toxins involved in food poisoning. Although most of these toxins are enterotoxins (protein exotoxins with the site of action on the mucosal cells of the intestinal tract) there are also other toxins involved in food poisoning, like the neurotoxins. In Table 1 the most important food pathogens in Europe are listed. For most, but not all, of these food pathogens, toxins are virulence factors. Generally, we divide food poisoning into infections and intoxications, where Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. are typical examples of infections and Clostridium botulinum and Staphylococcus aureus for intoxications. We consider it better to make four different groups of food pathogenic bacteria, according to Table 2. Today the first three groups are all defined as infections, although for both group 2 and 3 the bacterium itself does not harm the host directly. The bacterium in such locations is like an 'enterotoxin factory'. The bacteria belonging to group 3 do not even interact with the epithelial cells in the intestine, while the bacteria of group 2 must colonise the epithelial cells prior to enterotoxin production.
TI  - Probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - DNA-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. In this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of Salmonella, E. coli, V. cholerae, non-O1 Vibrio, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and C. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. In food control, DNA-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of DNA-based methods. The most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - Rho-ADP-ribosylating exoenzyme from Bacillus cereus. Purification, characterization, and identification of the NAD-binding site.
AB  - The ADP-ribosyltransferase produced by a pathogenic strain of Bacillus cereus was purified to near homogeneity. The transferase is a 28,000 Da molecular mass enzyme with a pI of 10.3. The specific enzyme activity is 7.0 nmol of ADP-ribose min-1 mg-1 with a Km for NAD of 0.3 microM. Partial amino acid sequence analysis of the exoenzyme reveals no significant homology to Clostridium botulinum C3 nor to Clostridium limosum exoenzyme. The novel exoenzyme selectively modifies the small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family presumably at the same acceptor amino acid (Asn-41) as determined for C3. Besides cellular Rho, recombinant RhoA and -B are substrates for the exoenzyme. However, recombinant Rac1 and CDC42, although belonging to the Rho family, are not modified. B. cereus exoenzyme was photolabeled with [carbonyl-14C]NAD resulting in inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD-glycohydrolase activity. A glutamic acid residue was identified as part of the NAD-binding site which corresponds to Glu-174 of C3. This glutamic acid is located in a domain which shows high homology with the C-terminal part of C3 exoenzyme, C. limosum exoenzyme, and Staphylococcus aureus EDIN and which probably represents the catalytic site of the transferases. The data indicate that B. cereus exoenzyme is a novel member of the family of C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases which share the same substrate protein Rho and which have an identical highly conserved catalytic domain.
TI  - Studies on the active-site structure of C3-like exoenzymes: involvement of glutamic acid in catalysis of ADP-ribosylation.
AB  - Various C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases like Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3,  C limosum transferase, B cereus transferase and a transferase from Staphylococcus aureus (EDIN) selectively modify the low-molecular mass GTP-binding proteins RhoA,B,C. UV-irradiation of C limosum transferase in the presence of [carbonyl-14C]NAD resulted in radiolabeling of Glu-174. Concomitantly, ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities were inhibited. Site-directed mutagenesis of Glu-174 (E174D, E174Q) which resulted in more than 1000-fold reduction of enzyme activity, suggests that the glutamic acid residue is essentially involved in the catalytic action of C3-like transferases. These findings support the view that all bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases share a similar active-site structure.
TI  - GTP-binding proteins are involved in the modulated activity of human neutrophils  treated with the Panton-Valentine leukocidin from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Significant amounts of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) are generated by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) after incubation with the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (Luk-PV) from Staphylococcus aureus V8 strains. We showed that GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved in the Luk-PV-activated signal transduction of PMNs. ADP-ribosylation of heterotrimeric G proteins by cholera and pertussis toxins decreased the Luk-PV-induced LTB4-generation. In contrast, ADP-ribosylation of the low-molecular-weight G proteins rho and rac by Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 increased the Luk-PV-induced LTB4 synthesis. The subsequent stimulation of Luk-PV-treated PMNs by either calcium ionophore A23187, sodium fluoride, or formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine was significantly inhibited. This decrease was paralleled by a loss of G-protein functions, including GTPase activity and GTP-binding capacity. An increase of G-protein functions was obtained with low amounts of Luk-PV. In addition to the modulated G-protein functions, ADP-ribosylation of 24-, 40-, and 45-kDa proteins by Luk-PV was detected. As shown in control experiments, the ADP-ribosylated 24-kDa proteins were not substrates for C. botulinum exoenzyme C3. Introduction of ras p21 into digitonin-permeabilized PMNs was without effect on subsequent Luk-PV stimulation. In addition, the translocation of ras p21, ras GAP, and 5-lipoxygenase into the membrane of Luk-PV-treated PMNs, as well as the expression of chemotactic membrane receptors for LTB4 and formylmethionyl leucyl phenylalanine, was significantly diminished.
TI  - Comparative analysis of C3 and botulinal neurotoxin genes and their environment in Clostridium botulinum types C and D.
AB  - The C3 exoenzyme gene is located on a bacteriophage in Clostridium botulinum types C and D (M. R. Popoff, D. Hauser, P. Boquet, M. W. Eklund, and D. M. Gill, Infect. Immun. 59:3673-3679, 1991). A derivative CN phage from phage C of C. botulinum Stockholm (C-St) (K. Oguma, H. Iida, and K. Inoue, Jpn. J. Microbiol. 19:167-172, 1975), isolated as neurotoxin negative, also does not produce exoenzyme C3. The botulinal neurotoxin C1 gene is present on the CN phage but contains a stop mutation in the DNA region encoding the N-terminal part of the heavy chain (codon 553). The putative truncated botulinal neurotoxin C1 protein was not recovered in a C. botulinum strain harboring the CN phage. We found that the C3 gene is localized on a 21.5-kbp DNA fragment flanked by the core motif 5'-AAGGAG-3' in DNAs of phage C of C. botulinum 468 (C-468), C-St phage, and phage D of C. botulinum 1873 (D-1873). The 21.5-kbp DNA fragment is deleted in CN phage DNA, and the motif 5'-AAGGAG-3' is present only in one copy at the deletion junction, but the deletion in the CN phage could be nonspecific, since this phage was obtained by nitrosoguanidine treatment. These findings could indicate that the C3 gene is localized on a 21.5-kbp mobile element. C. botulinum type C strain 003-9 produces a C3 exoenzyme (Y. Nemoto, T. Namba, S. Kozaki, and S. Narumiya, J. Biol. Chem. 266:19312-19319, 1991), and Staphylococcus aureus E1 produces a related C3 enzyme which is named epidernmal cell differentiation inhibitor (S. Inoue, M. Sugai, Y. Murooka, S. Y. Paik, Y. M. Hong, H. Oghai, and H. Suginaka, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 174:459-464, 1991) and which shares 80.6 and 56.6% similarity, respectively with the C3 enzymes from C-468 or C-St and D-1873 phages athe amino acid level. The features of the putative 21.5-kbp transposon were not found in C. botulinum 003-9 and S. aureus E1, as determined by analysis of the C3 and epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor gene-flanking DNA regions. These data suggest a common ancestral origin and divergent evolution of the C3 genes in these three groups of bacterial strains and dissemination of a 21.5-kbp element carrying the C3 gene C-468, C-St, and D-1873 phages.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic bacteria in the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Faecal samples from 123 infants who died with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and from a comparative group of 52 age-matched babies were analysed for toxigenic bacteria and their toxins. Serum samples from the SIDS infants were also analysed for these toxins. A significantly higher proportion of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins were found in faecal samples of SIDS babies than in samples from the comparative group. These toxins were also found in serum from the SIDS babies. Clostridium perfringens was found in 54 (45.4%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 10 (19.6%) of 51 healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.1, p < 0.01); C. difficile in 33 (27.7%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 8 (14.8%) of 54 healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.43ns, p < 0.1); Staphylococcus aureus in 12 (27.3%; 66.7% enterotoxigenic) of 44 SIDS cases compared with 12 (85.7%; non-enterotoxigenic) of 14 healthy babies (chi 2 = 14.9, p < 0.001); C. botulinum in 6 (5.0%) of 120 SIDS cases compared with 0 of 53 healthy babies (chi 2 = 2.74, p < 0.1). Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonellae and Bacillus cereus were not detected. Heat-labile toxin, lethal to mice (HLML) was found in 32 (27.1%) of 118 SIDS faecal samples compared with 5 (10.6%) of 47 healthy babies (chi 2 = 5.24, p < 0.05); cytotoxins in 38 (30.9%) of 123 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 21 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 8.8, p < 0.01) and 24 (27.6%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 33 (34.4%) of 96 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 23 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.94, p < 0.001), and in 27 (24.5%) of 110 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens alpha-toxin (presumptive) was detected in 14 (17.5%) of 80 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 17 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.5ns, p congruent to 0.05) and in 2 (2.3%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. difficile toxin was detected in four SIDS faecal samples and two serum samples. C. botulinum toxin was detected in only one of 120 SIDS faecal samples compared with none of 49 from healthy babies. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 19 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 4.278, p < 0.05), and in 4 (10.8%) of 37 SIDS serum samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Susceptibility to infection in relation to SIDS.
AB  - Because there is little evidence that invasive bacterial diseases contribute to cot deaths, most studies on infectious causes of SIDS have focused on viruses or toxin producing bacteria. Although epidemiological studies found marginally significant associations between influenza virus and SIDS, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was isolated from 90% of older infants with SIDS. There are conflicting reports that some toxigenic bacteria (Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium difficle, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) might be implicated in cot deaths. S aureus are common micro-organisms and their toxins are very powerful. As the pyrogenic toxic shock syndrome toxin of S aureus can kill a previously healthy adult, it might easily kill a small infant. Based on our studies on susceptibility of infants to other infections, we suggest the following might be factors leading to colonisation of infants by toxin producing S aureus: The Lewis blood group antigen appears to act as a receptor for some micro-organisms. Epithelial cells expressing high concentrations of Lewis bound appreciably more toxin producing S aureus than cells expressing low concentrations of the antigen. Lewis is expressed in secretions of nearly 90% of infants aged 3 months, the peak age for SIDS. RSV infects about 50% of infants by the first year of life and it is often isolated from infants with SIDS. Studies in our laboratory indicate that RSV infected HEp-2 cells bind more toxin producing S aureus than uninfected controls.
TI  - NAD+ binding site of Clostridium botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase. Identification of peptide in the adenine ring binding domain using 2-azido NAD.
AB  - C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase is an exoenzyme produced by certain strains of Clostridium botulinum types C and D, which specifically ADP-ribosylates rho proteins in eukaryotic cells. Using the photoaffinity probe [alpha-32P]nicotinamide-2-azidoadenine dinucleotide, we have identified the adenine ring binding domain of the NAD+ binding site. The specificity of labeling was demonstrated by saturation effects and protection by the natural compound at physiologically relevant concentrations. Saturation of labeling was observed at 50 microM. Protection experiments indicated an 80% protection of labeling by 100 microM NAD+ when protein was photolyzed in the presence of 10 microM probe. Trypsin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion of the photolabeled protein, along with boronate affinity chromatography and immobilized metal affinity chromatography, was used to specifically isolate the peptide region photolabeled with the probe. The peptide corresponded to Phe9-Gly19 near the N terminus.
TI  - Involvement of rho p21 in the GTP-enhanced calcium ion sensitivity of smooth muscle contraction.
AB  - In the rabbit mesenteric arterial smooth muscle skinned by saponin, Ca2+ induced  contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, lowered the Ca2+ concentrations required for this contraction and increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of the skinned smooth muscle contraction. GTP gamma S alone did not induce the contraction in the absence of Ca2+. This GTP gamma S-enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity was completely abolished by an exoenzyme of Staphylococcus aureus, named EDIN, and an exoenzyme of Clostridium botulinum, named C3, both of which are known to ADP-ribosylate the rho p21 family that belongs to the ras p21-like small GTP-binding protein superfamily. The GTP gamma S-bound form of rhoA p21 overcame the inhibitory action of EDIN. smg p21B, another small GTP-binding protein, was inactive. EDIN ADP-ribosylated a protein, which was most likely to be rho p21, in the skinned smooth muscle. The GTP gamma S-bound form of rhoA p21, but not the GDP-bound form, substituted for GTP gamma S and enhanced the Ca2+ sensitivity of the skinned smooth muscle contraction. smg p21B was inactive. These results indicate that rhoA p21 is involved in the GTP gamma S-enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity of the smooth muscle contraction.
TI  - In vitro activity of sulphimidazole alone and in association with trimethoprim against enteric pathogens.
AB  - Sulphimidazole is a new sulphonamide belonging to the class of intestinal sulphonamides and characterized by the fact that it is active even in vitro. It has the heterocyclic ring of 5-nitroimidazoles on amidic nitrogen. Its antibacterial activity is similar to that of the classical sulphonamides but differs in that it also combats certain anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum. This effect is completely absent in the case of sulphadiazine and sulphamethoxazole. Also, since p-amino-benzene-sulphonamide is present in the molecule, the drug acts in synergism with trimethoprim against certain aerobic or facultative strains of enteric pathogens.
TI  - Epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor ADP-ribosylates small GTP-binding proteins and induces hyperplasia of epidermis.
AB  - Epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN) is a recently discovered protein  which inhibits terminal differentiation of cultured keratinocytes (Sugai, M., Enomoto, T., Hashimoto, K., Matsumoto, K., Matsuo, Y., Ohgai, H., Hong, Y.-M., Inoue, S., Yoshikawa, K., and Suginaka, H. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 173, 92-98). The amino acid sequenced deduced from the EDIN gene has revealed that EDIN shares high amino acid sequence homology with the exoenzyme C3 of Clostridium botulinum (Inoue, S., Sugai, M., Murooka, Y., Paik, S.-Y., Hong, Y.-M., Ohgai, H., and Suginaka, H. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 174, 459-464), which has been shown to ADP-ribosylate the rho/rac proteins (members of the small GTP-binding protein family). We show here that EDIN ADP-ribosylates rhoB p21 in time- and dose-dependent manners in a cell-free system. Kinetic studies of the ADP-ribosylation and peptide mapping of the reaction products of rhoB p21 by EDIN and C3 suggest that the mode of action of the ADP-ribosylation by EDIN is quite similar to that by C3 and that the ADP-ribosylation site of rhoB p21 by EDIN is presumably the same as that by C3. Proteins in epidermal membranes and keratinocyte homogenate with Mr values of about 22,000 are ADP-ribosylated by EDIN or C3. Treatment of cultured human keratinocytes by EDIN or C3 results in an inhibition of terminal differentiation and a stimulation of growth of the cells. Moreover, EDIN and C3 injected into adult mouse skin induce hyperplasia of epidermis. These results suggest that EDIN and C3 affect growth and differentiation of keratinocytes by ADP-ribosylation of protein(s) with a Mr of about 22,000, which may be the rho/rac proteins or related proteins.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequencing of the epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor  gene from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We recently purified to homogeneity a protein inhibiting differentiation of cultured keratinocytes from extracellular products of Staphylococcus aureus, and named it epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN). In the present study, we isolated and sequenced the structural gene coding for EDIN from Staphylococcus aureus E-1 using oligonucleotide probes on the basis of the partial amino acid sequence of the purified EDIN. DNA sequencing of the cloned DNA revealed an open reading frame encoding 247 amino acids as a precursor of EDIN, which included an NH2-terminal signal sequence of 35 amino acid residues. Processing of this precursor produces a mature EDIN protein composed of 212 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 23,782. The EDIN shared 35% amino acid homology with the ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 of Clostridium botulinum. These results with biological properties of EDIN described previously indicate that EDIN is a novel protein.
TI  - Sodium hypophosphite inhibition of the growth of selected gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Sodium hypophosphite (SHP) was evaluated for inhibition of growth of selected Gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria in Trypticase Soy Broth. In addition, the effects of pH and sodium chloride (NaCl) alone and in combination with (SHP) were also examined. All inhibition studies were performed with optimal or nearly optimal growth conditions for each bacterium. Growth was monitored by determining culture optical density at 600 nm, and a time to significant growth determined for each test media. Ratios of time to significant growth for each control over that in test variables were used to evaluate the effect of SHP and other variables on growth. SHP was effective in inhibiting growth of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum strains 62A 52A and Lamanna B, but generally ineffective against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Results from this investigation show that SHP has potential as a food ingredient for the inhibition of certain Gram-positive foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Studies on the irradiation of toxins of Clostridium botulinum and Staphylococcus  aureus.
AB  - The effects of irradiation of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type A (BNTA) and  staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) in gelatin phosphate buffer and cooked mince beef slurries were investigated. Estimation of toxins by immunoassays showed that in buffer, toxins were destroyed by irradiation at 8.0 kGy; in mince slurries however, 45% of BTNA and 27-34% of SEA remained after this level of irradiation. At 23.7 kGy, over twice the dose of irradiation proposed for legal acceptance in the UK, 15% of BNTA and 16-26% of SEA still remained. Increasing concentrations of mince conferred increased protection against the effect of irradiation on both toxins. The biological activity of BNTA was more sensitive to irradiation than the immunological activity. Staphylococcal enterotoxin was more resistant to irradiation than BNTA. Irradiation should therefore only be used in conjunction with good manufacturing practices to prevent microbial proliferation and toxin production prior to irradiation.
TI  - Egg yolk paste for determining some food poisoning bacteria.
AB  - Egg yolk, aseptically prepared from fresh eggs, was partially dehydrated with a 40% high fructose corn syrup solution, and 10% salt was added. This salted yolk paste was added to mannitol salt agar for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus, to NaCl-glycine Kim and Goepfert medium for detection of Bacillus cereus, to Clostridium welchii agar for detection of C. perfringens, and to Gifu anaerobic medium for detection of C. botulinum. These food poisoning bacteria showed the same lecithovitellin (LV) reaction on these media as on the same media prepared with fresh egg yolk. The yolk paste could be stored at -20 C without freezing and did not show any bacterial growth after holding at 25 C for 30 days. The increased salt content resulted from the addition of salted yolk paste to the media did not inhibit the growth of the food poisoning bacteria used in these experiments. For the identification of the food poisoning bacteria used in this work, and which give a LV reaction, salted yolk paste is more convenient to use than yolk separated from fresh shell eggs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  - Egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including Listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. We also found that the food spoilage thermophile Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme and confirmed that the spoilage organisms Bacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. Several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. The results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - [Effect of components of curing mixtures on the antagonistic properties of enterococci and other bacteria isolated from cured meat].
AB  - Effect of sodium chloride, glucose, sodium glutamate, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, sodium nitraite, ascorbic acid, sodium citrate, polyphosphates (Hamine) on antagonistic activity of enterococci and various bacteria isolated from cured meat against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi-murium, Salmonella cholerae-suis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium botulinum type A, Clostridium botulinum type B, Clostridium botulinum type E, Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium perfringens type A, Clostridium sporogenes. It was found that some of the chemical compounds examined increased the antagonistic effect and other compounds partly or totally inhibited it. Sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, glucose, and ascorbic acid in majority of cases increased antagonism and sodium citrate and polyphosphates restrained this phenomenon.
TI  - [Recent advances in the molecular mechanism of action of bacterial toxins, in particular of diphtheria, cholera, coli, botulinum and shigella toxins as well as tetanospasmin and the toxins of staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - Great progress was achieved in the clarification of the molecular structure and the mechanism of action of the toxins of pathogenic forms of bacteria. Proportions of toxins of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa transfer from the NAD and ADP-ribose protein to an amino acid of the elongation factor 2. Thus the protein synthesis is much inhibited. The cholera toxin and the L-toxin from Escherichia coli have a similar structure. They transfer an ADP-ribose portion from NAD to the GTP-protein of the adenylate cyclase complex, by which means the GTPase activity is reduced. The increase of the cAMP content leads to an increase of the permeability of the cells of the intestinal epithelium. The tetanospasmin decreases the production of the inhibitingly acting neurotransmitters ( glycin ) from intermediate neurons and thus evokes spasms. The botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine from the motor end-plates and leads to paralyses. Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens form among others cytolysins which are injurious to membranes.
TI  - Effect of antibiotics on production of enzymes and toxins by microorganisms.
AB  - The synthesis of microbial products is mediated by either chromosomes, plasmids,  or bacteriophages. The role of some of these products in the pathogenicity of the producing organisms is clearly understood, while the identity and role of others are still under investigation. This article reviews the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on the synthesis of various microbial products (virulence factors) by producing organisms. Synthesis in many cases is enhanced, whereas in others it is either decreased or unaffected. Highly selective inhibition of the production of some enzymes and toxins by certain antibiotics may be explained by the fact that the ribosomes synthesizing these proteins are peripherally localized and may be more sensitive to inhibition by low concentrations of antibiotics than are cytoplasmic ribosomes, although conclusive evidence for the synthesis of bacterial enzymes and toxins on membrane-bound ribosomes is lacking.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of rock cod (Sebastes spp.) stored under elevated carbon dioxide atmospheres.
AB  - The numbers and types of microorganisms on fresh rock cod fillets and fillets stored in air or in a modified atmosphere (MA; 80% CO(2), 20% air) at 4 degrees C were compared. Samples were analyzed after 0, 7, 14, and 21 days of storage. The isolation plates were incubated aerobically, anaerobically, or under MA at 4, 20, or 35 degrees C. After 7 days of storage in air, the fillets were obviously spoiled and had a 3- to 4-log cycle increase in microbial counts. Plate counts increased more slowly on MA-stored fillets. After 21 days, the counts on the latter had increased only 2 log cycles, and the fillets did not seem spoiled. The microbial flora changed greatly during MA storage. Only Lactobacillus spp. (70%) and an Aeromonas sp.-like isolate (30%) were found on plates incubated aerobically at 4 and 20 degrees C, and only Lactobacillus spp. was found on plates incubated aerobically and anaerobically at 35 and at 20 degrees C under MA. Isolation plates incubated at 20 degrees C in air gave the highest counts in the shortest incubation time and the greatest diversity of bacterial types recovered. No Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, or Clostridium botulinum type E were isolated from the fresh or MA-stored fillets.
TI  - Antigenic hemagglutination inhibition test in examining of the culture supernatants of Clostridium botulinum types A, B, E, and F and some related bacterial species.
AB  - The hemagglutination inhibition test with using lyophilized preparations of the double botulinal indicator system (antigen sensitized erythrocytes and type-specific homologous antitoxic globulin) was used to the identification of the Cl. botulinum types A, B, E and F culture supernatants and the supernatants of other related bacteria. In the examined indicator hemagglutination system, the type-specific results were obtained in spite of the existence of antigenic cross-reactivity known inside the genus Clostridium. Absence hemagglutination inhibition reaction of the botulinal indicator system with cultured supernatants of the protein A - positive Staph. aureus strains was discussed.

TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of foodborne diseases.
AB  - Many bacterial species are responsible for sporadic cases and outbreaks of foodborne intoxication and infection. The foodborne diseases are classified on the basis of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved into four categories: performed toxin, enterotoxin formed in the colonized small intestine, mucosal invasion (enterocolitis) and mucosal invasion with bacteremia. Invasive and toxigenic strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli are discussed. In vivo test systems for the identification of enterotoxigenic organisms and tissue culture assays for the heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli are described. Current laboratory methods for the diagnosis of foodborne diseases of major public health interest are reviewed - botulism, staphylococcal intoxication, Clostridium perfringens enteritis, salmonellosis, enteropathogenic E. coli infection, Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection and Bacillus cereus enteritis. The role of the laboratory in the epidemiologic surveillance and investigation of foodborne diseases is emphasized.

TI  - Effect of potassium sorbate on salmonellae, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum in cooked, uncured sausage.
AB  - Skinless precooked, uncured sausage links with and without potassium sorbate (0.1% wt/wt) were inoculated with salmonellae, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum and held at 27 C to represent temperature abuse of the product. Total counts of uninoculated product showed that the normal spoilage flora was delayed 1 day when sorbate was present. Growth of salmonellae was markedly retarded by sorbate. Growth of S. aureus was delayed 1 day in the presence of sorbate, after which growth occurred to the same level as in product without sorbate. C. perfringens declined to below detectable levels within the first day in product with and without sorbate. Sorbate retarded the growth of C. botulinum. Botulinal toxin was detected in 4 days in product without sorbate but not until after 10 days in product with sorbate.
TI  - Radiometric detection of some food-borne bacteria.
AB  - Studies on detection of bacteria by radiometric techniques have been concerned primarily with aerobic species in clinical specimens. The data presented here are related to detection of aerobic and anaerobic species that are of significance in foods, by measurement of (14)CO(2) evolved from the metabolism of (14)C-glucose. Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus were inoculated into tryptic soy broth containing 0.0139 muCi of (14)C glucose/ml of medium. Detection times ranged from 10 to 3 hr for inocula of 10(0) to 10(4) cells/ml of broth. Heat-shocked spores of Clostridium sporogenes or C. botulinum were incubated in tryptic soy broth supplemented with Thiotone and NaHCO(3). The medium was rendered anaerobic with N(2). Spores were detected when 0.0833 muCi of labeled glucose was available/ml of medium but not when 0.0139 muCi of glucose was present/ml. The spores required 3 to 4 hr longer for detection than did comparable numbers of aerobic vegetative cells. The results demonstrate the importance of availability of sufficient label in the media and the potential of the application of this technique for sterility testing of foods.
TI  - Structural changes in Clostridium botulinum type E after treatment with boticin S5 1 .
AB  - Treatment with boticin S5(1), a bacteriocin produced by a nontoxigenic organism closely related to Clostridium botulinum type E, caused extensive changes in the structure of a sensitive C. botulinum type E strain. Nucleoid deoxyribonucleic acid, normally seen as fine filaments scattered throughout the cell, was aggregated into dense deoxyribonucleic acid masses. Mesosomes appeared to undergo structural rearrangement from lamellar to vesicular configuration. Eventual dissolution of cell contents left bacterial ghosts composed of seemingly intact cell walls with remnants of the cytoplasmic membrane and internal structures. The morphological changes observed in boticin-treated strain 070 cells were very similar to those produced by a bacteriocin-like substance from phage type 71 Staphylococcus aureus on sensitive beta-hemolytic streptococci. A similarity in the mode of action of the two bactericidal agents is suggested.
TI  - Collagenolytic activity of bacteria.
AB  - Actively growing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were screened by a plate assay, with reconstituted guinea pig collagen as a substrate, for their ability to produce a collagenolytic factor. Collagenolytic activity was not demonstrated among the aerobic organisms tested, with the exception of one strain of Staphylococcus aureus (only when grown under anaerobic conditions). Collagenolytic activity, however, was detected in cultures of Clostridium tetani and Bacteroides species other than B. melaninogenicus. Collagenolytic activity of these organisms could be confirmed by measuring the amount of hydroxyproline liberated from the collagen gel during growth. Although collagenase production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been suggested in previous reports, our results were negative. An extracellular fraction of P. aeruginosa was able to hydrolyze a synthetic hexapeptide Cbz-glycyl-l-prolyl-glycyl-glycyl-l-prolyl-l- alanine, but was without detectable effect on reconstituted collagen.
TI  - Food-borne bacterial toxins.
AB  - Food poisoning caused by the ingestion of preformed bacterial toxins is considered in relation to comparative symptoms, procedures for extraction and purification of the causal toxins, their chemistry, serology, assay procedures and pharmacology, in so far as these are known.The bacteria discussed in this context are Clostridium botulinum, C. perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Vibrio parahemolyticus. The possible roles of the enterococci, Proteus, E. coli and of unknown species, in relation to production of non-antigenic toxic substances, are discussed briefly.Requirements for prevention of the various forms of bacterial food poisoning are outlined.
TI  - Effect of vacuum packaging on growth of Clostridium botulinum and Staphylococcus  aureus in cured meats.
AB  - Incrimination of vacuum-packaged smoked fish in outbreaks of botulism has raised  questions about the safety of this process in comparison with other methods of packaging foods. It has been suggested, for example, that Clostridium botulinum may grow better in a vacuum-packaged product than in one that is packaged without vacuum. To evaluate this possibility, sliced bologna was inoculated with spores of C. botulinum type A, packaged in transparent plastic film with and without vacuum, and stored at temperatures within the growth range of the organism. There was no detectable difference in the rate of toxin development in the two types of packages. In contrast, vacuum packaging markedly inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus on sliced ham. The results indicate that vacuum packaging has little if any effect on the ability of C. botulinum to grow in cured meats, but it may reduce the likelihood of staphylococcal food poisoning.
