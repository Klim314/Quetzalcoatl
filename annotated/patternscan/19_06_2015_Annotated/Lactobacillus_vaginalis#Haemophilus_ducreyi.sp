TI  == design of a "microbicide" for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases using "inactive" pharmaceutical excipients.
AB  == the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-1) pandemic has been driven primarily by the sexual transmission of the virus, and facilitated by prior infections with other sexually transmitted disease (std) pathogens. although treatment of these stds has been proposed as a means to decrease the rate of hiv-1 sexual transmission, preventive measures effective against both hiv-1 and other std pathogens are expected to have a larger impact. these measures include topically  applied mechanical and chemical (i.e. microbicidal) barriers. microbicides of preference should have a broad specificity against diverse std pathogens and a well established safety record, considering their repeated use over decades. here, we report that cellulose acetate phthalate (cap), an "inactive" pharmaceutical excipient, commonly used in the production of enteric tablets and  capsules: (1) has antiviral activity against hiv-1 and several herpesviruses (hsv); and (2) when appropriately formulated, in micronized form, inactivates hiv-1, hsv-1, hsv-2, cytomegalovirus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi and chlamydia trachomatis but does not affect lactobacilli, components of the natural vaginal flora contributing to resistance  against stds. thus, the cap formulations meet the criteria for preferred microbicides and warrant further evaluation in vivo in humans.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.
