TI  == design and in vitro evaluation of a novel poly(methacrylic acid)/metronidazole antibacterial nanogel as an oral dosage form.
AB  == to overcome the undesirable side-effects of metronidazole (mtz), ethylene glycol  dimethacrylate is used as the cross-linker, and a series of poly(methacrylic acid) (pmaa) nanogels were prepared to load the mtz. we investigated the morphology, size, in vitro release property in the simulated gastrointestinal medium, long-term antibacterial performance against bacteroides fragilis, cytotoxicity, stability and activity of this novel mtz/pmaa nanogel. the results  indicate that the mtz/pmaa nanogel sustained the release of mtz in long-term antibacterial activity in the simulated gastrointestinal medium. this mtz/pmaa nanogel exhibits less cytotoxicity than mtz alone, suggesting that mtz/pmaa nanogel is a more useful dosage form than mtz for mild-to-moderate clostridium difficile infections. the novel aspects of this study include the synthesis of a  nanogel and the three-phase study of the release profile, which might be useful for other researchers in this field.

TI  == microbiota-liberated host sugars facilitate post-antibiotic expansion of enteric  pathogens.
AB  == the human intestine, colonized by a dense community of resident microbes, is a frequent target of bacterial pathogens. undisturbed, this intestinal microbiota provides protection from bacterial infections. conversely, disruption of the microbiota with oral antibiotics often precedes the emergence of several enteric  pathogens. how pathogens capitalize upon the failure of microbiota-afforded protection is largely unknown. here we show that two antibiotic-associated pathogens, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium) and clostridium difficile, use a common strategy of catabolizing microbiota-liberated mucosal carbohydrates during their expansion within the gut. s. typhimurium accesses fucose and sialic acid within the lumen of the gut in a microbiota-dependent manner, and genetic ablation of the respective catabolic pathways reduces its competitiveness in vivo. similarly, c. difficile expansion is aided by microbiota-induced elevation of sialic acid levels in vivo. colonization of gnotobiotic mice with a sialidase-deficient mutant of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a model gut symbiont, reduces free sialic acid levels resulting in c. difficile downregulating its sialic acid catabolic pathway and exhibiting impaired expansion. these effects are reversed by exogenous dietary administration of free sialic acid. furthermore, antibiotic treatment of conventional mice induces a spike in free sialic acid and mutants of both salmonella and c. difficile that are unable to catabolize sialic acid exhibit impaired expansion. these data show that antibiotic-induced disruption of the resident microbiota and subsequent alteration in mucosal carbohydrate availability are exploited by these two distantly related enteric pathogens in a  similar manner. this insight suggests new therapeutic approaches for preventing diseases caused by antibiotic-associated pathogens.

TI  == duodenal infusion of donor feces for recurrent clostridium difficile.
AB  == background: recurrent clostridium difficile infection is difficult to treat, and  failure rates for antibiotic therapy are high. we studied the effect of duodenal  infusion of donor feces in patients with recurrent c. difficile infection. methods: we randomly assigned patients to receive one of three therapies: an initial vancomycin regimen (500 mg orally four times per day for 4 days), followed by bowel lavage and subsequent infusion of a solution of donor feces through a nasoduodenal tube; a standard vancomycin regimen (500 mg orally four times per day for 14 days); or a standard vancomycin regimen with bowel lavage. the primary end point was the resolution of diarrhea associated with c. difficile infection without relapse after 10 weeks. results: the study was stopped after an interim analysis. of 16 patients in the infusion group, 13 (81%) had resolution of c. difficile-associated diarrhea after the first infusion. the 3 remaining patients received a second infusion with feces from a different donor, with resolution in 2 patients. resolution of c. difficile infection occurred in 4 of 13 patients (31%) receiving vancomycin alone and in 3 of 13 patients (23%) receiving vancomycin with bowel lavage (p<0.001 for both comparisons with the infusion group). no significant differences in adverse events among the three study groups were observed except for mild diarrhea and abdominal cramping in the infusion group on the infusion day. after donor-feces infusion, patients showed increased fecal bacterial diversity, similar to that in healthy donors, with an increase in bacteroidetes species and clostridium clusters iv and xiva and a decrease in proteobacteria species. conclusions: the infusion of donor feces was  significantly more effective for the treatment of recurrent c. difficile infection than the use of vancomycin.

TI  == comparative effects of the immediate and the extended release formulations of ciprofloxacin on normal human intestinal microflora.
AB  == ciprofloxacin is a well-known fluoroquinolone, active in vitro against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ecological effects of an orally administered extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin in comparison with an immediate-release formulation  of ciprofloxacin on the normal human intestinal microflora. thirty-six healthy female subjects were included in the study. the extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin was given as 500 mg once daily and the immediate-release formulation as 250 mg twice daily. the treatment period was 3 days. the microbiological investigation was blinded with respect to treatment. mean fecal concentration in the volunteers receiving the extended-release formulation ciprofloxacin was 453 mg/kg and in the immediate-release formulation ciprofloxacin volunteers, the mean fecal concentration was 392 mg/kg. the numbers of escherichia coli were significantly suppressed while the enterococci decreased moderately in both treatment groups. no toxigenic clostridium difficile strains were found. no major differences were observed between the two studied formulations on the normal human intestinal microflora.

TI  == tlr2 transmodulates monocyte adhesion and transmigration via rac1- and pi3k-mediated inside-out signaling in response to porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  == we present evidence for a novel tlr2 function in transmodulating the adhesive activities of human monocytes in response to the fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen implicated in chronic periodontitis and atherosclerosis. monocyte recruitment into the subendothelium is a crucial step in atherosclerosis, and we investigated the role of p. gingivalis fimbriae in stimulating monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and transendothelial migration. fimbriae induced cd11b/cd18-dependent adhesion of human monocytes or mouse macrophages to endothelial receptor icam-1; these activities were inhibited by tlr2 blockade or deficiency or by pharmacological inhibitors of pi3k. moreover, this inducible adhesive activity was sensitive to the action of clostridium difficile toxin b, but was not affected by clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme, pertussis toxin, or cholera toxin. accordingly, we subsequently showed through the use of dominant negative signaling mutants of small gtpases, that rac1 mediates the ability of fimbria-stimulated monocytes to bind icam-1. a dominant negative mutant of rac1 also inhibited the lipid kinase activity of pi3k suggesting that rac1 acts upstream of pi3k in this proadhesive pathway. furthermore, fimbriae stimulated monocyte adhesion to huvec and transmigration across huvec monolayers; both activities required tlr2 and rac1 signaling and were dependent upon icam-1 and the high-affinity state of cd11b/cd18. p. gingivalis-stimulated monocytes displayed enhanced transendothelial migration compared with monocytes stimulated with nonfimbriated isogenic mutants. thus, p.  gingivalis fimbriae activate a novel proadhesive pathway in human monocytes, involving tlr2, rac1, pi3k, and cd11b/cd18, which may constitute a mechanistic basis linking p. gingivalis to inflammatory atherosclerotic processes.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and comparative effects of telithromycin (hmr 3647) and clarithromycin on the oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics in plasma and saliva of a new ketolide, telithromycin (hmr 3647), and the effect on the normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora were  studied in healthy volunteers and compared with those of clarithromycin. ten subjects received 800 mg telithromycin perorally once daily and 10 other subjects received 500 mg clarithromycin bid for 10 days. blood, saliva and faecal specimens were collected at defined intervals before, during and after administration for pharmacokinetic and microbiological analyses. in subjects receiving telithromycin, the mean c:(max), auc and c:(24) (24 h) in saliva exceeded the values obtained from plasma, while saliva and serum pharmacokinetic  parameters were in the same range for the clarithromycin group. the quantitative  ecological disturbances in the normal microflora during administration of telithromycin were moderate and comparable to those associated with clarithromycin administration. no overgrowth of yeasts or clostridium difficile occurred. emergence of resistant strains was seen in both treatment groups. administration of both telithromycin and clarithromycin was associated with significant increases in mics for intestinal bacteroides isolates, which persisted 2 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. in addition, a significant  emergence of highly clarithromycin-resistant alpha-haemolytic streptococci, intestinal enterococci and enterobacteriaceae was detected at day 10 in the clarithromycin group. in conclusion, administration of telithromycin resulted in  high drug levels in saliva, which indicates a good therapeutic profile for throat infections. telithromycin seems to have a more favourable ecological profile compared with clarithromycin in terms of resistance development in the normal microflora.

TI  == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  == bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are predominant anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are common pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses and orofacial infections. clostridium perfringens can cause bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause diarrhea or antibiotic-associated colitis.

TI  == effect of oral ciprofloxacin on the faecal flora of healthy volunteers.
AB  == the effect of oral ciprofloxacin on the intestinal flora was investigated in six  male volunteers aged between 21 and 54 years. faecal specimens were cultured quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms before, during and after a five day course of ciprofloxacin. ciprofloxacin resulted in a significant reduction in aerobic flora in all volunteers and colonisation with resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacteria in two volunteers. the total anaerobic flora counts were significantly reduced in only one volunteer. neither  clostridium difficile nor its toxin was detected and there was no significant colonisation with pseudomonas spp. or yeasts; no ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli were detected. peak serum levels on days 1 and 5 of 1.6-4.3 mg/l (mean 2.7) were achieved after 30-90 min and urine recovery over the five days was 27.1-44.6%.

TI  == impact of oral ciprofloxacin on the faecal flora of healthy volunteers.
AB  == the intestinal flora was studied in 12 volunteers after the administration of 400 mg ciprofloxacin b.i.d. over seven days. stool samples were taken prior to and several times after the initiation of therapy, and qualitative and quantitative analyses of microorganisms were performed. escherichia coli was eliminated in all volunteers after two days of treatment. a selection of resistant enterobacteria could not be observed. a higher incidence of streptococcus faecium was seen, mainly after the end of drug application. the number of cfu of bacteroides and bifidus species remained unchanged during the trial. there was no selection of clostridium difficile. based on this pattern of activity on the stool flora we suggest that ciprofloxacin could represent an appropriate drug for the therapy of bacterial intestinal infections as well as for selective decontamination in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. anaerobes can be  isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. the genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) offteroides, clostridium, gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, actinomyces, and bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (veillonella and acidaminococcus). clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.
