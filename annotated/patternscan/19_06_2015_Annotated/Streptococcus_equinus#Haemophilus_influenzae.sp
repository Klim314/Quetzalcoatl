TI  == [recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: the bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  == introduction: recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. the causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. patients and  methods: retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. results: case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (mri) after 2 episodes of haemophilus influenzae meningitis. surgical repair after third recurrence. case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by mri with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae. ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. case 3: girl with meningitis due to staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. mri shows occipital dermal sinus  requiring excision. complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. case 4: child with meningitis due to streptococcus bovis at 9 days and enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to citrobacter freundii and e. faecium later on. spinal mri led to the diagnosis of currarino syndrome with csf fistula, which was surgically repaired. the 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. conclusions: in patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. the isolated microorganism should help to locate it. it is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. the definitive treatment is usually surgical.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial activity of alexomycin (pnu-82, 127), a peptide compound projected for use in animal health.
AB  == alexomycin (pnu-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by streptomyces arginensis. mics against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. alexomycin was active against gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and  coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), as well  as enterococcus species (95 strains; mic90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml), and generally inactive against gram-negative aerobes. alexomycin had more potent activity against streptococcus bovis (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), s. agalactiae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), corynebacterium species (mic90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/ml), and listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). alexomycin activity was limited against bacillus species (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), neisseria  meningiditis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml). this thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/ml) in mueller-hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and  did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to  increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == purification and characterization of a malic enzyme from the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis atcc 15352 and cloning and sequencing of its gene.
AB  == malic enzyme (ec 1.1.1.39), which catalyzes l-malate oxidative decarboxylation and pyruvate reductive carboxylation, was purified to homogeneity from streptococcus bovis atcc 15352, and properties of this enzyme were determined. the 2.9-kb fragment containing the malic enzyme gene was cloned, and the sequence was determined and analyzed. the enzymatic properties of the s. bovis malic enzyme were almost identical to those of other malic enzymes previously reported. however, we found that the s. bovis malic enzyme catalyzed unknown enzymatic reactions, including reduction of 2-oxoisovalerate, reduction of 2-oxoisocaproate, oxidation of d-2-hydroxyisovalerate, and oxidation of d-2-hydroxyisocaproate. the requirement for cations and the optimum ph of these unique activities were different from the requirement for cations and the optimum ph of the l-malate oxidative decarboxylating activity. a sequence analysis of the cloned fragment revealed the presence of two open reading frames that were 1,299  and 1,170 nucleotides long. the 389-amino-acid polypeptide deduced from the 1,170-nucleotide open reading frame was identified as the malic enzyme; this enzyme exhibited high levels of similarity to malic enzymes of bacillus stearothermophilus and haemophilus influenzae and was also similar to other malic enzymes and the malolactic enzyme of lactococcus lactis.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome, a new fourth-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpirome was compared with amoxycillin/clavulanic  acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and amikacin against 743 non-duplicate clinical isolates. mic50 and mic90 showed that the antibiotic was active against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. cefpirome was highly active against most of the enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus spp., aeromonas spp. (mic < or = 1 mg/l) and salmonella spp. (mic < or = 0.5 mg/l). neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were all susceptible, with mic less than 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l respectively. cefpirome was more active than cefuroxime and ceftazidime against campylobacter spp. (mic < or = 2 mg/l), but less active than  ceftazidime against pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefpirome was active against streptococcus pneumoniae. streptococcus bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic < or = 0.5 mg/l) and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l). methicillin-resistant s. aureus, gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes were resistant to cefpirome. the stability of cefpirome to tem-1, tem-2, pse-1, shv-1 and the chromosomal-mediated p99 and k-1 beta-lactamases was comparable to ceftazidime.

TI  == in-vitro activity of win 57273 compared to the activity of other fluoroquinolones and two beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == win 57273, a new fluoroquinolone, was four to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. the mic90 for staphylococcus aureus was 0.015 mg/l and for s. epidermidis, 0.03 mg/l. all lancefield group a, b, c, & g streptococci, streptococcus bovis and s. pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l compared to 0.5 mg/l for tosufloxacin and 2 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. for anaerobic bacteria win 57273 had an mic90 for bacteroides of 1 mg/l, and for clostridium spp. 0.015.mg/l. win 57273 was less active than ciprofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic90 of 1 mg/l, including aminoglycoside and cephalosporin-resistant isolates. the mic90 of win 57273 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 mg/l, compared to 0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria  gonorrhoeae, and legionella spp. were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l. win 57273 was more  active against gram-negative bacteria at acid ph, but activity was decreased by magnesium ions and an increase in inoculum. resistant strains were selected after passage on antibiotic-containing agar.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin bay  v 3522.
AB  == the activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to mics of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. it was more active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. groups b, c and g streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the mi"90 for streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for enterococci and listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most bacteroides spp. were resistant. the mic90 for beta-lactamase positive escherichia coli (producing primarily tem-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. the mic90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus  mirabilis, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. bay v 3522 was destroyed by tem-1, shv-1, tem-3 and p99 beta-lactamases.

TI  == in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ly163892.
AB  == ly163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. it inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group b streptococci and groups c, f, g and bovis streptococci with mics  of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. mic90 of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. ly163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with mic90 values of 16 mg/l for escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis. it had no activity against enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and pseudomonas and bacteroides spp. ly163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. it was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. for tem-1, the km = 354.7 microm, vmax = 2.5 micromoles/min/mg of protein, p99 km = 24.3 microm, vmax = 28.9 microm/min/micrograms of protein, staph. aureus pc km = 47.4 microm,  vmax = 2.7 micromoles/min/mg of protein. overall it had beta-lactamase stability  similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.

TI  == bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

TI  == in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.

TI  == meningitis caused by streptococcus in adults.
AB  == meningitis caused by streptococcus is uncommon in adults. otitis media, mastoiditis, sinusitis, or trauma has antedated most cases reported in the past.  data on 10 recent cases suggest changes in the current pathogenesis of streptococcal meningitis in adults and emphasize the importance of accurate streptococcal speciation. endocarditis was present in five cases; trauma played a role in two others. brain abscess, corticosteroids, alcoholic cirrhosis, and peritonitis secondary to chronic peritoneal dialysis were etiologic factors in five patients. otitis media, mastoiditis, and sinusitis were conspicuously absent. streptococcus agalctiae accounted for purulent meningitis in two postmenopausal women. both strains of group b streptococcus were bacitracin-sensitive and were thus mislabeled group a. recognition of streptococcus bovis spared two patients unnecessary aminoglycoside adminstration. nine of the 10 patients survived, including a women with prosthetic mitral valve  endocarditis and a man with a ruptured brain abscess. differentiation of these streptococci from streptococcus pneumoniae was seldon possible on the basis of the spinal fluid gram stain alone.

TI  == shared antigens between heterologous bacterial species.
AB  == sera from normal rabbits were shown to have antibodies that bound radiolabeled test antigens derived from many taxonomically unrelated bacteria. sera from rabbits that had been immunized with sonically treated material of 12 different bacteria, including m. bovis strain bcg, had antibodies that bound not only radiolabeled homologous test antigens but also radiolabeled antigens from many unrelated bacteria. binding by normal and immunized sera to radiolabeled test antigens was inhibited by homologous unlabeled test antigens but not by substances such as bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sheep erythrocytes, and endotoxin. the broad range of shared or cross-reactivity among  antigens in bacteria may explain the presence of antibodies to many bacteria in sera from normal humans and previously unimmunized experimental animals. the presence of these antibodies raises the question whether resistance to many bacterial infections may be partly due to immune mechanisms, whether cellular or  humoral, that have been stimulated by unrelated bacteria.
