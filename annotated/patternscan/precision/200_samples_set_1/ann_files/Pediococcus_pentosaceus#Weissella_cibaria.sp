TI  == identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  == a total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. according to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences and reca gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these lab isolates were identified as five species: lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus mundtii, weissella cibaria and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two l. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains zzu 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited salmonella enterica atcc 43971(t), micrococcus luteus atcc 4698(t) and escherichia coli atcc 11775(t) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, ph and protease. cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees c), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees c for 15 min. the antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (ph 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (ph 7.0 to 9.0). in addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease k. these results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains zzu 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. the nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.

TI  == influence of lactic acid bacteria on redox status and on proteolytic activity of  buckwheat (fagopyrum esculentum moench) sourdoughs.
AB  == redox potential and proteolysis determine protein networks in doughs and thus dough rheology as well as the structure of baked goods. namely, gluten-free bakery products needs structural improvements but little is known about these parameters in gluten free dough systems. in this work the influence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on redox status and proteolysis of buckwheat sourdoughs was investigated. an increase of free thiol groups was detected as redox potential was decreasing during fermentation. thiol content at 8 h was higher in doughs fermented with strains with high reductive activity, such as weissella (w.) cibaria in comparison to pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus, which exhibited a lower reducing activity. at 24 h each fermentation showed a similar content of free thiol groups. endogenous buckwheat proteases were characterized using various protease inhibitors in buckwheat doughs. until ph3.1 a proteolysis increase was monitored in doughs. employed lab didn't show any detectable extracellular proteolytic activity. flour proteases are thus responsible for protein breakdown, and this was demonstrated comparing free amino nitrogen (fan) values and protein  electrophoretic patterns of sourdough fermentations with chemical acidified (ca)  doughs. fan content at 24 h using p. pentosaceus, proteolytic comparative strain  of enterococcus faecalis, w. cibaria, mixed culture (containing p. pentosaceus and w. cibaria), ca and ca doughs containing glutathione (gsh) reached 45.9+/-1.3, 42.4+/-1.3, 40+/-1, 31+/-2, 29+/-2 and 17.8+/-3.9 mmol kg(-1) flour,  respectively. proteolysis was mainly influenced by ph and incubation time. the addition of gsh showed a decrease of proteolysis and of free amino acids. ca doughs showed a higher total free amino acids content than sourdough fermented with lab indicating their metabolization. fermentations with high fan values exhibited lower band intensity (analyzed under reducing condition) in electrophoretic patterns. these results show that dough proteases are responsible for proteolysis in buckwheat sourdoughs and this activity is influenced from lab  metabolism. moreover, oxidation-reduction potential (orp) changes do not show improvements of proteolytic activity in buckwheat sourdoughs.

TI  == antimicrobial activity, antibiotic susceptibility and virulence factors of lactic acid bacteria of aquatic origin intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.
AB  == background: the microorganisms intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture should exert antimicrobial activity and be regarded as safe not only for the aquatic hosts but also for their surrounding environments and humans. the objective of this work was to investigate the antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity  against fish pathogens, the antibiotic susceptibility, and the prevalence of virulence factors and detrimental enzymatic activities in 99 lactic acid bacteria (lab) (59 enterococci and 40 non-enterococci) isolated from aquatic animals regarded as human food. results: these lab displayed a broad antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity against the main gram-positive and gram-negative fish pathogens. however, particular safety concerns based on antibiotic resistance and virulence factors were identified in the genus enterococcus (86%) (enterococcus faecalis, 100%; e. faecium, 79%). antibiotic resistance was also found in the genera weissella (60%), pediococcus (44%), lactobacillus (33%), but not in leuconostocs and lactococci. antibiotic resistance genes were found in 7.5% of the non-enterococci, including the genera  pediococcus (12.5%) and weissella (6.7%). one strain of both pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella cibaria carried the erythromycin resistance gene mef(a/e), and another two p. pentosaceus strains harboured lnu(a) conferring resistance to lincosamides. gelatinase activity was found in e. faecalis and e. faecium (71 and 11%, respectively), while a low number of e. faecalis (5%) and none e. faecium exerted hemolytic activity. none enterococci and non-enterococci  showed bile deconjugation and mucin degradation abilities, or other detrimental enzymatic activities. conclusions: to our knowledge, this is the first description of mef(a/e) in the genera pediococcus and weissella, and lnu(a) in the genus pediococcus. the in vitro subtractive screening presented in this work  constitutes a valuable strategy for the large-scale preliminary selection of putatively safe lab intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in spontaneously-fermented buckwheat and teff sourdoughs.
AB  == in this study, four different laboratory scale gluten-free (gf) sourdoughs were developed from buckwheat or teff flours. the fermentations were initiated by the  spontaneous biota of the flours and developed under two technological conditions  (a and b). sourdoughs were propagated by continuous back-slopping until the stability was reached. the composition of the stable biota occurring in each sourdough was assessed using both culture-dependent and -independent techniques.  overall, a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts species, belonging mainly to the genera lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, kazachstania and candida, were identified in the stable sourdoughs. buckwheat and teff sourdoughs were dominated mainly by obligate or facultative heterofermentative lab, which are commonly associated with traditional wheat or rye sourdoughs. however, the spontaneous fermentation of the gf flours resulted also in the selection of species which are not consider endemic to traditional sourdoughs, i.e. pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc holzapfelii, lactobacillus  gallinarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus graminis  and weissella cibaria. in general, the composition of the stable biota was strongly affected by the fermentation conditions, whilst lactobacillus plantarum  dominated in all buckwheat sourdoughs. lactobacillus pontis is described for the  first time as dominant species in teff sourdough. among yeasts, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida glabrata dominated teff sourdoughs, whereas the solely kazachstania barnetti was isolated in buckwheat sourdough developed under condition a. this study allowed the identification and isolation of lab and yeasts species which are highly competitive during fermentation of buckwheat or teff flours. representatives of these species can be selected as starters for the production of sourdough destined to gf bread production.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for the strain-specific identification of probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1.
AB  == recent investigations clearly indicate that the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative probiotic foods whose marketing has been authorized by the italian ministry of health. in this study, strain impc2.1 was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its taxonomic position and to develop a pcr test for strain-specific identification. molecular methods, such as 16s rrna gene sequencing and multiplex pcr, have provided evidence that strain impc2.1 indeed belongs to the l. paracasei species. in addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (f-aflp) data strongly indicated that strain impc2.1 and nine other l. paracasei strains (including strain atcc 334) belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain l. casei atcc 393. the f-aflp technique was also used to identify a strain-specific dna fragment of l. paracasei impc2.1 - encoding an amino acid sequence similar to a glycosyltransferase of probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 - which enabled us to develop a rapid pcr test for  strain-specific identification. the strain-specificity of the pcr test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from  vegetable products that did not produce any amplified fragment. these strains belonged to the l. paracasei species, to 6 additional species of lactobacillus and to weissella cibaria, w. confusa, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus. a method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex microbiota.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == glucan and fructan production by sourdough weissella cibaria and lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == after a large screening on sourdough lactic acid bacteria, exopolysaccharide (eps)-forming strains of weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus were selected. after 6 days of incubation at 30 degrees c, the synthesis of eps in mrs-based broth ranged from 5.54 to 7.88 mg ml-1. eps  had an apparent molecular mass of ca. 104 da. as shown by carbohydrate consumption, the synthesis of eps was found from sucrose only. two types of homopolysaccharides were synthesized: glucans simultaneously with growth and fructans after 1 day of incubation. two protein bands of ca. 180-200 kda were in  situ detected on sds-page gels incubated with sucrose. pcr products of ca. 220 bp were found for l. plantarum pl9 (100% of identity to putative priming glycosyltransferase of l. plantarum wcfs1) and w. cibaria wc4 (80% of identity to putative glycosyltransferase, epsd, of bacillus cereus g9241) by using hybrid primers for the priming gtf genes. degenerated primers dexreur and dexreuv showed a unique pcr product, and the predicted amino acid sequences were identical for w. cibaria wc4 and l. plantarum pl9. the sequence had similarity with polysaccharide biosynthesis glycosyltransferases. w. cibaria wc4 or l. plantarum  lp9 synthesized ca. 2.5 g kg-1 eps during sourdough fermentation with sucrose added. compared to the sourdough started with an eps-negative strain, the sourdough started with w. cibaria wc4 or l. plantarum lp9 increased the viscosity, and the resulting bread had higher specific volume and lower firmness. the synthesis of eps by selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria could be considered as a useful tool to replace the additives for improving the textural properties of baked goods.
