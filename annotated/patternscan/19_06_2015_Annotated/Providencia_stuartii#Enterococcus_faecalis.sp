TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == [nosocomial infections in a general surgical ward].
AB  == according to the national nosocomial infection surveillance system we analysed the post-surgical nosocomial infections in a surgery ward of perugia university.  between may 2000 and april 2001, 677 patients were enrolled mean age 51.5 years:  355 (52%) male, 462 (68%) asa score 1, "clean" surgery in 355 cases (52%), cephazolin prophylaxis in 256 (38%); 11 (2%) patients deceased perioperatively. a total of 37 nosocomial infections, in 33 patients, were detected: 18 pneumonia (48.6%), 10 surgical site infections (27%) with 18 isolated: 12 gram-negative (e. coli 3, acinetobacter baumannii 2, providencia stuartii 2, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2, achromobacter spp. 1, citrobacter freundii 1, morganella morgani 1) and 6 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus meticillin resistant 3, enterococcus faecalis 2, streptococcus salivarius 1); 7 sepsis (19%) due to 7 gram-positive (s. aureus meticillin resistant 4, s. aureus meticillin susceptible 1, staphylococcus coagulase negative 1, clostridium spp 1), 2 urinary tract infections (5.4%). patients without infections and with nosocomial infections spent in hospital 6.3 and 16.6 days respectively. we can image that in one year 53 surgical procedure were lost, with a lost gain of 79.500-291.500 euro/year.

TI  == escherichia coli 83972 inhibits catheter adherence by a broad spectrum of uropathogens.
AB  == objectives: the presence of a nonpathogenic organism on the surface of a urinary  catheter might impede catheter colonization by pathogens and thus prevent urinary tract infection. previously, we reported that preinoculating urinary catheters with a nonpathogenic strain of escherichia coli (83972) significantly impeded catheter colonization in vitro by gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis). to explore this phenomenon further, we investigated in vitro whether e. coli 83972 could likewise inhibit catheter colonization by gram-negative and fungal uropathogens (providencia stuartii, uropathogenic e. coli, and candida albicans). methods: for each of the three uropathogens tested, we examined three different incubation conditions: (a) e. coli plus uropathogen catheters were exposed to e.  coli 83972 for 24 hours and then to a uropathogen for 30 minutes; (b) e. coli-alone catheters were incubated with e. coli for 24 hours and then in sterile broth for 30 minutes; and (c) uropathogen-alone catheters were incubated in sterile broth for 24 hours before the 30-minute incubation with the uropathogen.  all catheters were subsequently incubated in sterile human urine for 24 hours. catheters were then rinsed and sonicated to determine the numbers of adherent organisms per centimeter. results: pre-exposure of the catheter to e. coli 83972  in all cases significantly reduced the number of uropathogens colonizing the catheter surfaces. conclusions: e. coli 83972 significantly impedes catheter colonization by all tested bacterial and fungal pathogens. the broad applicability of this particular approach to bacterial interference in vitro invites further exploration in vivo.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == men 10700, a new penem antibiotic: in-vitro activity and its correlation with beta-lactamase stability, pbp affinity and diffusion through the bacterial cell wall.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of men 10700, a novel penem, was compared with that of imipenem, ritipenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin against 1088 strains taken from 21 genera, including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that men 10700 was very active against staphylococci and streptococci (mic90 < or = 0.5 mg/l) and against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mic90 < or = 2 mg/l), with reduced activity only against providencia stuartii (mic90 = 8 mg/l). men 10700 was also active against  anaerobic species such as clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis as well as moraxella catarrhalis. it was moderately active against enterococcus faecalis and inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. its antibacterial spectrum was thus slightly narrower than that of imipenem, but compared favourably with those  of a third-generation cephalosporin and ritipenem. men 10700 was highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases and was a poor inducer of class i enzymes. it bound penicillin-binding protein 2 with the highest affinity and easily permeated the outer membrane of escherichia coli.

TI  == antimicrobial spectrum and target site of d-3-phenyllactic acid.
AB  == geotrichum candidum excretes d-3-phenyllactic acid, which inhibits the growth of  listeria monocytogenes. it was found to inhibit a range of gram-positive bacteria found in humans and foodstuffs, such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative bacteria from humans, such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella oxytoca. scanning electron microscope studies on the effect of d-3-phenyllactic acid on l. monocytogenes showed that it caused changes in bacterial behavior and structure. the bacteria formed aggregates and secreted polysaccharides; their cell walls lost their rigidity, causing the cells to swell. finally the bacteria broke down completely and the cells disintegrate.

TI  == emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  == we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100%  to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in europe. study group 'bacterial resistance' of the paul-ehrlich-society for chemotherapy e. v.
AB  == since 1984, when the first fluoroquinolone, norfloxacin, was marketed in europe,  there has been a marked increase in the usage of this class of drugs. in order to evaluate the influence of this drug usage on the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in clinical isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis we reviewed the susceptibility data from four collaborative surveys conducted between 1983 and 1990 by the study group 'bacterial resistance' of the paul-ehrlich-society for chemotherapy. all participating laboratories used the same standardized methods. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the broth microdilution method. more than 20,000 bacterial strains were tested. the results are presented for ciprofloxacin, which is regarded as the representative of the fluoroquinolones. using > or = 4 mg/l as a breakpoint for resistance to ciprofloxacin, the prevalence of resistant strains of the family enterobacteriaceae in central europe between 1983 and 1990 remained below 1%. in contrast, the resistance rates in p. aeruginosa were 0.7%, 1.0%, 3.8% and 7.0%, in s. aureus 0%, 0.5%, 6.6% and  6.8%, and in e. faecalis 2.2%, 0.7%, 4.9% and 7.7% in 1983, 1986, 1989 and 1990,  respectively. the latest study carried out in cooperation with 78 laboratories from 12 european countries revealed great differences in the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones from one species to another ranging from 0% with proteus vulgaris and salmonella spp. to 26.7% with providencia stuartii.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == incidence of bacteria from clean-catch and catheterized urine of nursing home residents.
AB  == urine cultures from 1990 through 1992 were analyzed to determine the incidence of common isolates in residents from over 50 nursing homes in oklahoma. of all 11,480 isolates in clean-catch and catheterized specimens, the most common were:  escherichia coli (24% of all isolates), pseudomonas aeruquinosa (11%), proteus mirabilis (10%), enterococcus faecalis (8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7%), providencia stuartii (5%), and staphylococcus aureus (4%). the most striking findings of this study were the similarities in frequencies of isolates from clean-catch and catheterized urines, the common occurrence of p. stuartii, and the low proportion of urea-splitting p. stuartii isolates from catheterized specimens.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study,  identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also  had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.

TI  == assessment of antiseptic bladder washout procedures using a physical model of the catheterised bladder.
AB  == a simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. the activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with edta + tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. except for phenoxyethanol against pv. stuartii and possibly ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. however, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate ps. aeruginosa. it is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three aminoglycosidic antibiotics: bb-k8, kanamycin, and gentamicin.
AB  == kanamycin, bb-k8, and gentamicin were tested in parallel against 1,037 bacterial  strains isolated from clinical material. the activity of bb-k8 at 20 mug/ml was comparable to that of gentamicin at 8 mug/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa and against enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of gentamicin-resistant strains of proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii, in which case the activities of bb-k8  and kanamycin were the same. bb-k8 exhibited little or no activity against streptococci. the activity of bb-k8 was affected by ph and inoculum size. a regression graph for inhibition data with a 10-mug disk of bb-k8 was developed, and synergistic activity of penicillin and bb-k8 against streptococcus faecalis was tested.
