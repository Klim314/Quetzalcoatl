TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == probiotic administration modifies the milk fatty acid profile, intestinal morphology, and intestinal fatty acid profile of goats.
AB  == the effect of a mixture of potentially probiotic bacteria (mppb; lactobacillus reuteri ddl 19, lactobacillus alimentarius ddl 48, enterococcus faecium dde 39, and bifidobacterium bifidum strains) on the milk fatty acid (fa) profile, with emphasis on cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla) in the middle stage of  goat lactation, was determined. in addition, the effects of mppb feeding on the fa profile in intestinal content and intestinal morphology in weaned goats were analyzed. the probiotic supplement was able to modify fa composition of milk and  intestinal content. the unsaturated fa concentrations in milk (g of fa/l of milk) increased from 4.49 to 7.86 for oleic (18:1), from 0.70 to 1.39 for linoleic (18:2), from 0.063 to 0.187 for linolenic (18:3) acid, and from 0.093 to 0.232 for cla. the atherogenicity index diminished 2-fold after mppb ingestion. in the  intestinal content of the weaned goats, no significant difference in saturated fa concentration compared with the control was observed. however, oleic acid, linolenic acid, cla, and docosahexaenoic acid concentrations increased by 81, 23, 344, and 74%, respectively, after probiotic consumption. the ruminal production of cla was increased by the mppb. however, bacterial strains of mppb were unable  to produce cla in culture media. by histological techniques, it was observed that the treated group had intestinally more conserved morphological structures than the control group. the results obtained in this study indicate that the mppb administration in lactating and weaned goats allows for the production of milk with improved concentrations of beneficial compounds, and also produces a protective effect in the goat intestine. the results obtained in this study reinforce the strategy of probiotics application to enhance goat health with the  production of milk with higher concentrations of polyunsaturated fa.

TI  == effect of dietary incorporation of a multi-strain probiotic on growth performance and health status in rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss).
AB  == dietary supplementation with a multi-strain probiotic containing bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and lactobacillus reuteri has been examined for its effects on growth performance, intestinal microbiota, non-specific immune response and antioxidant status of rainbow trout. three groups of sub-adult trout were stocked into experimental tanks. a commercial diet was used as control, while the other two groups received diets supplemented with the multi-strain probiotic at levels of 1 and 5 g kg(-1) diet.  the fish were fed to apparent satiation three times daily for 8 weeks. dietary probiotic at 1 g kg(-1) diet improved (p < 0.05) growth and feed efficiency compared to control diet. lactic acid bacteria loads were higher in probiotic fed fish at both inclusion levels compared to control; however, enterobacteriaceae, coliforms and aeromonas spp. were similar between groups. dietary probiotics decreased (p < 0.05) malondialdehyde formation on day 0 compared to control fish  but not on day 5 of storage. probiotics also increased (p < 0.05) the activity of glutathione-based enzymes. serum lysozyme levels were similar among dietary treatments. probiotic supplementation at 1 g kg(-1) diet reduced serum nitric oxide levels compared to control. in conclusion, dietary probiotics at the level  of 1 g kg(-1) of diet exerted both a growth promoting and antioxidant protective  activity.

TI  == thiouracil-forming bacteria identified and characterized upon porcine in vitro digestion of brassicaceae feed.
AB  == in recent years, the frequent detection of the banned thyreostat thiouracil (tu)  in livestock urine has been related to endogenous tu formation following digestion of glucosinolate-rich brassicaceae crops. recently, it was demonstrated that, upon in vitro digestion of brassicaceae, fecal bacteria induce tu detection in livestock (porcine livestock > bovines). therefore, the present study was intended to isolate and identify bacteria involved in this intestinal tu formation upon brassicaceae digestion and to gain more insight into the underlying mechanism in porcine livestock. twenty porcine fecal inocula (gilts and multiparous sows) were assessed through static in vitro colonic-digestion simulations with rapeseed. after derivatization and extraction of the fecal suspensions, tu was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms(2)). on average, lower tu concentrations were observed in fecal colonic simulations in gilts (8.35 ng g(-1) rapeseed +/- 3.42 [mean +/- standard deviation]) than in multiparous sows (52.63 ng g(-1) +/- 16.17), which correlates with maturation of the gut microbial population with age. further exploration of  the mechanism showed cell-dependent activity of the microbial conversion and sustained tu-forming activity after subjection of the fecal inoculum to moderate  heat over a time span of up to 30 min. finally, nine tu-producing bacterial species were successfully isolated and identified by a combination of biochemical and molecular techniques as escherichia coli (n = 5), lactobacillus reuteri (n =  2), enterococcus faecium (n = 1), and salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae (n = 1). this report demonstrates that endogenous formation of tu is brassicaceae induced and occurs under colonic conditions most likely through myrosinase-like enzyme activity expressed by different common intestinal bacterial species.

TI  == potential of goat probiotic to bind mutagens.
AB  == the mutagen binding ability of the goat probiotics (lactobacillus reuteri ddl 19, lactobacillus alimentarius ddl 48, enterococcus faecium dde 39, and bifidobacterium bifidum ddba) was evaluated. the oral administration of these probiotics reduced fecal mutagens and intestinal cancer markers in goats. secondly, the effects of probiotics against the mutagenesis induced by sodium azide (sa), and benzopyrene (b[alpha]p) by performing the modified ames test using salmonella typhimurium ta 100 was investigated. the capacity to bind benzopyrene and the stability of the bacterial-mutagen complex was analyzed by hplc. the dismutagenic potential against both mutagens was proportional to probiotic concentration. results showed that probiotic antimutagenic capacity against sa was ranging from 13 to 78%. the mixture of four goat probiotics (mgp)  displayed higher antimutagenic activity against sa than any individual strains at the same cell concentration. this study shows that the highest diminution of mutagenicity in presence of b[alpha]p (74%) was observed in presence of mgp. the  antimutagenic activity of nearly all the individual probiotic and the mgp were in concordance with the b[alpha]p binding determined by hplc. according to our results, the b[alpha]p binding to probiotic was irreversible still after being washed with dmso solution. the stability of the toxic compounds-bacterial cell binding is a key consideration when probiotic antimutagenic property is evaluated. mgp exhibits the ability to bind and detoxify potent mutagens, and this property can be useful in supplemented foods for goats since it can lead to  the removal of potent mutagens and protect and enhance ruminal health and hence food safety of consumers.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == effect of probiotics on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease: implications for heart-healthy diets.
AB  == the objectives of this article are to review clinical trials that have examined the effects of probiotics on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) and to assess the potential of probiotic intake as a therapeutic lifestyle change (tlc)  dietary option. twenty-six clinical studies and two meta-analyses are reviewed. significant ldl-c reductions were observed for four probiotic strains: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 30242, enterococcus faecium, and the combination of lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and bifidobacterium lactis bb12. two synbiotics, l. acidophilus cho-220 plus inulin and l. acidophilus plus fructo-oligosaccharides,  also decreased ldl-c. of the probiotics examined, l. reuteri ncimb 30242 was found to best meet tlc dietary requirements by 1) significantly reducing ldl-c and total cholesterol, with robustness similar to that of existing tlc dietary options, 2) improving other coronary heart disease risk factors, such as inflammatory biomarkers, and 3) having "generally recognized as safe" (gras) status. based on these results, the probiotic l. reuteri ncimb 30242 is a viable  candidate both for future tlc dietary studies and as a potential option for inclusion in tlc dietary recommendations.

TI  == screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
AB  == thermotolerant campylobacter spp., specifically campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. the aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains capable of  inhibiting c. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. these experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. a total of 1,150 lab strains were screened for anti-campylobacter activity. six strains were selected: members of the species lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. after treatment with catalase, proteinase k and a-chymotrypsin, anti-campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (csf) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. based on the activity found in csf, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. during initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the e. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for c. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. in these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the e. faecalis strain against c. jejuni mb 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. the best inhibition results were obtained when e. faecalis was inoculated before the  c. jejuni strain, lowering c. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. this effect was already observed 6 h after c. jejuni inoculation.

TI  == evaluating the efficacy of an avian-specific probiotic to reduce the colonization of campylobacter jejuni in broiler chickens.
AB  == campylobacteriosis is the most frequent zoonotic disease in humans worldwide, and the contaminated poultry meat by campylobacter jejuni can be considered one of the important sources of enteric infections in humans. the use of probiotics, which can help to improve the natural defense of animals against pathogenic bacteria, is an alternative and effective approach to antibiotic administration for livestock to reduce bacterial contamination. in vitro experiments showed that enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus reuteri isolated from healthy chicken gut inhibited the growth of c. jejuni. to demonstrate this effect in vivo, 1-d-old broiler chicks received 2  mg/bird per day of a multispecies probiotic product via the drinking water. controls received no probiotic treatment, and all chicks were infected with c. jejuni orally. results showed that the cecal colonization by c. jejuni was significantly reduced by probiotic treatment at both 8 and 15 d postchallenge. to confirm this effect, in a second in vivo experiment, 1-d-old broiler chicks received the same dose of the same probiotic via the drinking water and controls  received no probiotic, and all chicks were infected with c. jejuni orally. similarly, probiotic treatment reduced (p=0.001) cecal colonization by c. jejuni  at both 8 and 15 d postchallenge. the results of our in vivo experiments conclude that probiotic administration reduced the colonization of c. jejuni in broiler chickens.

TI  == dietary inclusion of feathers affects intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in growing leghorn-type chickens.
AB  == feather pecking in laying hens is a serious behavioral problem that is often associated with feather eating. the intake of feathers may influence the gut microbiota and its metabolism. the aim of this study was to determine the effect  of 2 different diets, with or without 5% ground feathers, on the gut microbiota and the resulting microbial fermentation products and to identify keratin-degrading bacteria in chicken digesta. one-day-old lohmann-selected leghorn chicks were divided into 3 feeding groups: group a (control), b (5% ground feathers in the diet), and c, in which the control diet was fed until wk 12 and then switched to the 5% feather diet to study the effect of time of first  feather ingestion. the gut microbiota was analyzed by cultivation and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis of ileum and cecum digesta. short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, and lactate concentrations were measured as microbial metabolites. the concentration of keratinolytic bacteria increased after feather ingestion in the  ileum (p < 0.001) and cecum (p = 0.033). bacterial species that hydrolyzed keratin were identified as enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus reuteri-like species (97% sequence homology), and lactobacillus salivarius-like species (97% sequence homology). molecular analysis of cecal dna  extracts showed that the feather diet lowered the bacterial diversity indicated by a reduced richness (p < 0.001) and shannon (p = 0.012) index. the pattern of microbial metabolites indicated some changes, especially in the cecum. this study showed that feather intake induced an adaptation of the intestinal microbiota in  chickens. it remains unclear to what extent the changed metabolism of the microbiota reflects the feather intake and could have an effect on the behavior of the hens.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == assessment of dietary supplementation with probiotics on performance, intestinal  morphology and microflora of chickens infected with eimeria tenella.
AB  == we evaluated the effects of dietary supplementation with different preparations of probiotics on the performance of broiler chickens experimentally infected with 2 x 10(4) sporulated oocysts of eimeria tenella at 14 days of age. three hundred, day-old, cobb-500 chicks, as hatched, were separated into 10 equal groups with three replicates. two of the groups, one challenged with e. tenella oocysts and the other not, were given a basal diet and served as controls without medication. the other challenged groups were given the anticoccidial lasalocid (60 mg/kg) or  enterococcus faecium (5 x 10(8) or 5 x 10(9)cfu/kg feed), bifidobacterium animalis (5 x 10(8)cfu/kg feed), lactobacillus reuteri (5 x 10(8)cfu/kg feed), bacillus subtilis (5 x 10(8)cfu/kg feed), or a multi-species probiotic mix at 5 x 10(8) or 5 x 10(9)cfu/kg feed, respectively. the trial lasted 6 weeks. individual body weight, feed intake per pen and feed conversion ratio values were recorded weekly, along with the extent of bloody diarrhea, excreta oocyst numbers and bird mortality. caecal lesions were assessed and intestinal samples were taken for histopathological and bacteriological evaluation from ileum and caecum. overall growth performance of chickens fed the multi-species probiotic mix at both levels was higher (p<0.05) compared to the infected control. overall oocyst shedding was lowest (p<0.05) in the lasalocid supplemented group. villous height was higher (p<0.05) in bacillus supplemented groups compared to infected controls. the lactobacillus supplemented group had the highest (p<0.05) numbers of both lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in ileum and caecum. in conclusion, dietary probiotics are promising for further investigation on improving intestinal health and growth performance of broiler chickens experimentally challenged with e. tenella.

TI  == monitoring the bacterial community of maize silage stored in a bunker silo inoculated with enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  == aims: to monitor variations in the bacterial community and fermentation products  of maize silage within and between bunker silos. methods and results: silage samples were collected in 2008 and 2009 from three dairy farms, wherein the farmers arranged for a contractor to produce maize silage using bunker silos. silage was prepared using a lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculant consisting of enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus buchneri. eight samples were collected from each bunker silo; 4 'outer' and 4 'inner' samples were collected from near the top and the bottom of the silo. the dry matter, lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1,2-propanediol contents differed between bunker silos in both sampling years. higher acetic acid, 1-propanol and 1,2-propanediol contents were found in the bottom than the top layers in the 2008 samples, and higher lactic acid content was found in the top than the bottom layers in the 2009 samples. the bacterial community varied more between bunker silos than within a bunker silo in the 2008 samples, whereas differences between the top and the bottom layers were seen across bunker silos in the 2009 samples. the inoculated lab were uniformly distributed, while several nonconventional silage bacteria were also detected. lactobacillus acetotolerans,  lactobacillus panis and acetobacter pasteurianus were detected in both years. stenotrophomonas maltophilia was detected in the 2008 samples, and lactobacillus  reuteri, acinetobacter sp. and rahnella sp. were detected in the 2009 samples. conclusions: although differences were seen within and between bunker silos, the  bacterial community may indicate a different relationship between bunker silos and sampling locations within a bunker silo from that indicated by the fermentation products. significance and impact of the study: analysis of bacterial community can help understand how diverse non-lab and lab species are involved in the ensiling process of bunker-made maize silage.

TI  == probiotic administration effect on fecal mutagenicity and microflora in the goat's gut.
AB  == the application of potentially beneficial microorganisms to increase host defense is a new trend to increase health benefits. in this paper the first specific host probiotics for goats from a mixture isolated from healthy animals (lactobacillus  reuteri ddl 19, lactobacillus alimentarius ddl 48, enterococcus faecium dde 39 and bifidobacterium bifidum ddba) was assayed. the effect of probiotic oral administration on goats' weight, gut microbiota, as well as on the production of  mutagen compounds and their indicator (putrescine), were evaluated. the probiotic supplement was able to modify microflora balance by reducing enterobacteria like  salmonella/shigella (1.09 and 1.21 log cfu/g feces, respectively) and increasing  lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria (1.67 and 2.34 log cfu/g feces, respectively). the probiotics administration was correlated with a ten time diminution of fecal putrescine (cancer and bacterial disease marker) and a decrease of 60% mutagen fecal concentration, indicating the protective effect of  the treatment. additionally, a significant increase in ruminant weight was observed after probiotic administration. these results are encouraging towards the use of probiotic mixtures as functional food for goats.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == ileal microbiota of growing pigs fed different dietary calcium phosphate levels and phytase content and subjected to ileal pectin infusion.
AB  == two experiments with growing pigs were conducted to determine the effects of dietary p and ca levels, phytase supplementation, and ileal pectin infusion on changes in bacterial populations in the ileum and on ileal and fecal fermentation patterns. growing pigs (bw 30.1 +/- 1.3 kg) were fitted with simple t-cannulas at the distal ileum and were fed a low-p corn-soybean meal control diet (3 g of p/kg), or the control diet supplemented with either 15 g of monocalcium phosphate (mcp)/kg (exp. 1) or 1,000 phytase units of phytase/kg (exp. 2). daily infusion treatments consisted of either 60 g of pectin dissolved in 1.8 l of demineralized water or 1.8 l of demineralized water as a control infusion, infused via the ileal cannula. in each experiment, 8 barrows were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to a double incomplete 4 x 2 latin square design. the dietary treatments in exp. 1 were the control diet with water infusion, the control diet with pectin infusion, the mcp diet with water infusion, or the mcp diet with pectin infusion. in exp. 2, the pigs received the same control treatments as in exp. 1 and the phytase diet in combination with water or pectin  infusion. gene copy numbers of total bacteria, lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus  reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus/lactobacillus sobrius, lactobacillus mucosae, enterococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacteria, the clostridium coccoides cluster, the clostridium leptum cluster, the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group, and enterobacteriaceae were determined by quantitative pcr in dna extracts of ileal digesta. in exp. 1, addition of mcp  reduced ileal gene copy numbers of enterococcus spp. (p = 0.048), e. faecium (p = 0.015), and the c. leptum cluster (p = 0.028), whereas pectin infusion enhanced (p = 0.008) ileal d-lactate concentration. in exp. 2, supplemental phytase led to greater ileal gene copy numbers of the c. coccoides (p = 0.041) and c. leptum (p  = 0.048) clusters and the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group (p = 0.033),  whereas it reduced (p = 0.027) fecal n-butyrate concentration. pectin infusion reduced (p = 0.005) ileal gene copy number of the c. leptum cluster. in conclusion, ileal bacterial populations and fermentation patterns are susceptible to changes in the intestinal availability of ca and p as well as to the supply of pectin as a fermentable substrate. greater intestinal ca availability decreased the numbers of some gram-positive bacteria, whereas greater p availability in the small intestine caused by phytase activity enhanced the growth of strictly anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of porcine bacteria that inhibit  the growth of brachyspira hyodysenteriae in vitro.
AB  == aims: to identify bacilli, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria that inhibit the growth of brachyspira hyodysenteriae. methods and results: a total of 80 isolates were obtained from various porcine intestinal compartments using selective conditions and grouped into 15 similarity clusters based on whole-cell  protein profiles. random amplified polymorphic dna pcr patterns identified 24 genotypes. 16s rdna sequencing assigned all genotypes, except eight aerobes, to established species (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, bifidobacterium thermophilum). according to their minimum inhibitory  concentrations, four strains (ent. faecium, lact. reuteri, lact. amylovorus, bif. thermophilum) were susceptible to all clinically relevant antibiotics. two lactobacilli showing multiresistance harboured the erm(b) determinant. a cross-section of eight representative strains was examined for growth suppression of two strains of brach. hyodysenteriae, the aetiological agent of swine dysentery, and compared with intestinal strains derived from other animal sources. the brachyspira strains were inhibited by strains of lact. salivarius, bif. thermophilum, ent. faecium and b. subtilis. conclusions: three porcine strains of ent. faecium, bif. thermophilum and b. subtilis were found to be suitable as probiotic candidates because of their well-established identity, antibiotic susceptibility and antagonistic activity. significance and impact of the study: for the first time, antagonistic activity of well-characterized porcine strains against brach. hyodysenteriae is presented. these findings suggest that certain intestinal strains might have a potential as probiotic feed  additives for prevention of swine dysentery.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for potential probiotic use  in iberian dry fermented sausages.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select lactic acid bacteria and bifibobacteria strains as potential probiotic cultures during the processing of iberian dry fermented sausages. a total of 1000 strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages (363), and human (337) and pig faeces (300) in different culture media. around 30% of these strains, mainly isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages in lamvab agar, were pre-selected for testing as potential probiotics by their ability to grow adequately at the ph values and nacl concentrations of these meat products during the ripening process. of the in vitro investigations used to predict the survival of a strain in conditions present in the gastro intestinal tract, exposure to ph 2.5 showed itself to be a  highly discriminating factor with only 51 out of 312 pre-selected strains resisting adequately after 1.5h of exposure. all acid-resistant isolates identified as lactobacilli originated from human faeces (lactobacillus casei and  lactobacillus fermentum) and pig faeces (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus animalis, lactobacillus murinus, and lactobacillus vaginalis). pediococcus acidilactici strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages and pig faeces, whereas the greatest number of enterococcus strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, with this species being isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages, and human and pig faeces. most of these strains are promising probiotic meat culture candidates suitable for iberian dry fermented sausages.

AB  == according to the german definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of l. casei or the l. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, certain enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) and the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact  with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are  basic mechanisms. they are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. in addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. well-established probiotic effects are: 1. prevention  and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. prevention or alleviation of allergies and  atopic diseases in infants. 7. prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). a prebiotic is  "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for  prebiotic classification. they are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. other health effects of prebiotics  (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect,  i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. in the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.

TI  == isolation and characterization of human intestinal bacteria capable of transforming the dietary carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine.
AB  == 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (phip) is a carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amine formed in meat products during cooking. although the  formation of hazardous phip metabolites by mammalian enzymes has been extensively reported, research on the putative involvement of the human intestinal microbiota in phip metabolism remains scarce. in this study, the in vitro conversion of phip into its microbial derivate, 7-hydroxy-5-methyl-3-phenyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyrido[3',2':4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyri midin-5-ium chloride (phip-m1), by fecal samples from 18 human volunteers was investigated. high-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that all human fecal samples transformed phip but with efficiencies ranging from 1.8 to 96% after 72 h of incubation. two phip-transforming strains, phip-m1-a and phip-m1-b, were isolated from human feces and identified by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism and phes sequence analyses as enterococcus faecium strains. some strains from culture collections belonging to the species e. durans, e. avium, e. faecium, and lactobacillus reuteri were also able to perform this transformation. yeast extract, special peptone, and meat extract supported phip transformation by the enriched e. faecium strains, while tryptone, monomeric sugars, starch, and cellulose did not. glycerol was identified as a fecal matrix  constituent required for phip transformation. abiotic synthesis of phip-m1 and quantification of the glycerol metabolite 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-hpa) confirmed that the anaerobic fermentation of glycerol via 3-hpa is the critical bacterial transformation process responsible for the formation of phip-m1. whether it is a detoxification is still a matter of debate, since phip-m1 has been shown to be cytotoxic toward caco-2 cells but is not mutagenic in the ames assay.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, certain strains of l. casei, l. acidophilus, escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and  enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) as well as the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. however, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.

TI  == development of a competitive exclusion product for poultry meeting the regulatory requirements for registration in the european union.
AB  == competitive exclusion treatment is able to increase the pathogen colonization resistance of day-old chicks by applying probiotic bacteria stabilizing the indigenous microflora. in order to develop a safe microbial feed additive, various bacterial strains were isolated out of the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chickens. one hundred twenty-one representatives were selected based on differences in whole-cell protein patterns and screened for antagonistic properties. five effective strains (pediococcus acidilactici, enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. animalis, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salivarius) exhibited in vitro the ability to inhibit a range of common pathogens and were evaluated with regard to the risks associated with genetic transfer of antibiotic resistances from animals to humans via the food chain. the probiotic strains were sensitive to several clinically effective antibiotics, though some of them showed single resistances. none of the vancomycin-resistant (r) strains carried the enterococcal vana gene. two tetracycline r strains were shown to harbor a tet(m)-associated resistance. the strains contained no extrachromosomal dna and were not able to transfer the resistance by means of conjugation. on basis of the collected data the presence of easy transferable resistances was excluded and the chicken strains were considered to be suitable for the use as feed additive.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == heat shock treatment increases the frequency of loss of an erythromycin resistance-encoding transposable element from the chromosome of lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692.
AB  == a 3,165-bp chromosomally integrated transposon, designatedtn3692, of the gram-positive strain lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692 contains an erm(b) gene conferring resistance to erythromycin at concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml. loss of this resistance can occur spontaneously, but the rate is substantially increased by heat shock treatment. heat shock treatment at 60 degrees c resulted in an almost 40-fold increase in the frequency of erythromycin-sensitive cells (erythromycin mic, 0.047 micrograms/ml). the phenotypic change was followed by a dramatic increase in transcription of the transposase gene and the concomitant loss of an approximately 2-kb dna fragment carrying the erm(b) gene from the 3,165-bp erm transposon. in cells that were not subjected to heat shock, transcription of the transposase gene was not detectable. the upstream sequence of the transposase gene did not show any homology to known heat shock promoters in the gene data bank. significant homology (>99%) was observed between the erythromycin resistance-encoding gene from l. crispatus chcc3692 and the erm(b) genes from other gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus  faecium, and lactobacillus reuteri, which strongly indicates a common origin of the erm(b) gene for these species. the transposed dna element was not translocated to other parts of the genome of chcc3692, as determining by southern blotting, pcr analysis, and dna sequencing. no other major aberrations were observed, as judged by colony morphology, growth performance of the strain, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. these observations suggest that heat shock treatment could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted antibiotic resistance genes harbored in transposons flanked by insertion sequence elements or transposases in lactic acid bacteria used for animal and human food production.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == development of rapd protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  == a protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fragments has been developed. using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic dna. different conditions of dna release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. this rapd protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. helveticus, lact. casei, lact. reuteri, lact. plantarum, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium  and streptococcus thermophilus.
