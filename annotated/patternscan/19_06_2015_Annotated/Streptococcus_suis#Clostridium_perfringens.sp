TI  == macedovicin, the second food-grade lantibiotic produced by streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198.
AB  == streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 was found to produce a second lantibiotic named macedovicin in addition to macedocin. macedovicin was purified to homogeneity and mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of approximately 3.4 kda. partial n-terminal sequence analysis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that macedovicin was identical to bovicin hj50 and thermophilin 1277 produced by streptococcus bovis and streptococcus thermophilus, respectively. macedovicin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, several food spoilage species (e.g. clostridium spp.) and oral streptococci. we determined the complete biosynthetic gene cluster of macedovicin. even though the gene clusters  of macedovicin, thermophilin 1277 and bovicin hj50 were almost identical at the nucleotide level, there were important differences in their predicted genes and proteins. bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics were also found to be encoded by streptococcus suis strains sc84 and d12, enterococcus columbae plch2, clostridium perfringens jgs1721 and several bacillus strains. all these lantibiotics contained a number of conserved amino acids that may be important for their biosynthesis and activity, while phylogenetic analysis supported their dispersion by horizontal gene transfer. in conclusion, the production of multiple bacteriocins may enhance the bio-protective potential of s. macedonicus during food fermentation.

TI  == identification and proteome analysis of the two-component virr/virs system in epidemic streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  == streptococcus suis serotype 2 (ss2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that infects pigs and sporadically causes serious infections in humans. two recent large-scale outbreaks of human streptococcal toxic-shock-like syndrome with high  mortality occurred in china, posing new challenges for global public health. however, the global regulation of the virulence of epidemic ss2 isolates lacks a  systematic understanding. in this study, we performed a mutational and functional analysis of an ss2 two-component system that is orthologous to the virr/virs regulatory system of clostridium perfringens. an isogenic knockout mutant of virr/virs (deltavirrs) was found to exhibit marked phenotypic changes, including  the formation of shorter chains and thinner capsular walls, more easily cleared in whole blood, and decreased oxidative stress tolerance. furthermore, the deltavirrs mutant was greatly attenuated in a mouse model. comparative proteome analysis of the expression profiles of the wild-type strain with the deltavirrs mutant allowed us to identify 72 proteins that are differentially expressed in the absence of the virr/virs system and that are directly responsible for the pleiotropic phenotype of the deltavirrs mutant.

TI  == crystal structure of cytotoxin protein suilysin from streptococcus suis.
AB  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdc) are pore forming toxins. a prototype of the cdc family members is perfringolysin o (pfo), which directly binds to the cell membrane enriched in cholesterol, causing cell lysis. however, an exception  of this general observation is intermedilysin (ily) of streptococcus intermedius, which requires human cd59 as a receptor in addition to cholesterol for its hemolytic activity. a possible explanation of this functional difference is the conformational variation between the c-terminal domains of the two toxins, particularly in the highly conserved undecapeptide termed tryptophan rich motif.  here, we present the crystal structure of suilysin, a cdc toxin from the infectious swine pathogen streptococcus suis. like pfo, suilysin does not require a host receptor for hemolytic activity; yet the crystal structure of suilysin exhibits a similar conformation in the tryptophan rich motif to ily. this observation suggests that the current view of the structure-function relationship between cdc proteins and membrane association is far from complete.

TI  == identification of the gene encoding a 38-kilodalton immunogenic and protective antigen of streptococcus suis.
AB  == in our continued effort to search for a streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of s. suis type 2. a clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized  within a 2.0-kbp ecori dna fragment. the nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kda. by in vitro protein synthesis and western  blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kda. at the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from streptococcus pneumoniae (89%),  streptococcus mutans (86%), lactococcus lactis (80%), listeria monocytogenes (74%), and clostridium perfringens (64%). except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in  strains of other s. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the ecori recognition sequence. we confirmed expression of the 38-kda protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. the recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of s. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most s. suis infections. pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kda protein mounted antibody responses to  the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of s. suis type 2, suggesting  that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against s. suis infection. analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. the functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic s. suis capsular  types remains to be determined.
