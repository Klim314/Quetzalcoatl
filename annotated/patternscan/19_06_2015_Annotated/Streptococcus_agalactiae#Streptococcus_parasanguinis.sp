TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == gap2 promotes the formation of a stable protein complex required for mature fap1  biogenesis.
AB  == serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (srrps) are important bacterial adhesins conserved in streptococci and staphylococci. fap1, a srrp identified in streptococcus parasanguinis, is the major constituent of bacterial fimbriae and is required for adhesion and biofilm formation. an 11-gene cluster is required for fap1 glycosylation and secretion; however, the exact mechanism of fap1 biogenesis remains a mystery. two glycosylation-associated proteins within this cluster--gap1 and gap3--function together in fap1 biogenesis. here we report the  role of the third glycosylation-associated protein, gap2. a gap2 mutant exhibited the same phenotype as the gap1 and gap3 mutants in terms of fap1 biogenesis, fimbrial assembly, and bacterial adhesion, suggesting that the three proteins interact. indeed, all three proteins interacted with each other independently and together to form a stable protein complex. mechanistically, gap2 protected gap3 from degradation by clpp protease, and gap2 required the presence of gap1 for expression at the wild-type level. gap2 augmented the function of gap1 in stabilizing gap3; this function was conserved in gap homologs from streptococcus  agalactiae. our studies demonstrate that the three gap proteins work in concert in fap1 biogenesis and reveal a new function of gap2. this insight will help us elucidate the molecular mechanism of srrp biogenesis in this bacterium and in pathogenic species.

TI  == gap1 functions as a molecular chaperone to stabilize its interactive partner gap3 during biogenesis of serine-rich repeat bacterial adhesin.
AB  == serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (srrps) are important bacterial adhesins that are conserved in streptococci and staphylococci. fimbriae-associated protein (fap1) from streptococcus parasanguinis, was the first srrp identified; it plays  an important role in bacterial biofilm formation. a gene cluster encoding glycosyltransferases and accessory secretion components is required for fap1 biogenesis. two glycosylation-associated proteins, gap1 and gap3 within the cluster, interact with each other and function in concert in fap1 biogenesis. here we report the new molecular events underlying contribution of the interaction to fap1 biogenesis. the gap1-deficient mutant rendered gap3 unstable  and degraded in vitro and in vivo. inactivation of a gene encoding protease clpp  reversed the phenotype of the gap1 mutant, suggesting that clpp is responsible for degradation of gap3. molecular chaperone groel was co-purified with gap3 only when gap1 was absent and also reacted with gap1 monoclonal antibody, suggesting that gap1 functions as a specific chaperone for gap3. the n-terminal interacting  domains of gap1 mediated the gap3 stability and fap1 biogenesis. gap1 homologues  from streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus also interacted with and  stabilized corresponding gap3 homologues, suggesting that the chaperone activity  of the gap1 homologues is common in biogenesis of srrps.

TI  == canonical seca associates with an accessory secretory protein complex involved in biogenesis of a streptococcal serine-rich repeat glycoprotein.
AB  == fap1, a serine-rich repeat glycoprotein (srrp), is required for bacterial biofilm formation of streptococcus parasanguinis. fap1-like srrps are found in many gram-positive bacteria and have been implicated in bacterial fitness and virulence. a conserved five-gene cluster, secy2-gap1-gap2-gap3-seca2, located immediately downstream of fap1, is required for fap1 biogenesis. seca2, gap1, and gap3 encode three putative accessory sec proteins. seca2 mediates export of mature fap1, and gap1 and gap3 are required for fap1 biogenesis. interestingly, gap1 and gap3 mutants exhibited the same phenotype as a seca2 mutant, implying that gap1 and gap3 may interact with seca2 to mediate fap1 biogenesis. glutathione s-transferase pulldown experiments revealed a direct interaction between seca2, gap1, and gap3 in vitro. coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the formation of a seca2-gap1-gap3 complex. homologues of seca2, gap1, and gap3 are conserved in many streptococci and staphylococci. the corresponding homologues from streptococcus agalactiae also interacted with each  other and formed a protein complex. furthermore, the gap1 homologues from s. agalactiae and streptococcus sanguinis rescued the fap1 defect in the gap1 mutant, indicating the functional conservation of the accessory sec complex. importantly, canonical seca interacted with the accessory sec protein complex, suggesting that the biogenesis of srrps mediated by the accessory sec system is linked to the canonical sec system.

TI  == a molecular chaperone mediates a two-protein enzyme complex and glycosylation of  serine-rich streptococcal adhesins.
AB  == serine-rich repeat glycoproteins identified from streptococci and staphylococci are important for bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. two putative glycosyltransferases, gtf1 and gtf2, from streptococcus parasanguinis form a two-protein enzyme complex that is required for glycosylation of a serine-rich repeat adhesin, fap1. gtf1 is a glycosyltransferase; however, the function of gtf2 is unknown. here, we demonstrate that gtf2 enhances the enzymatic activity of gtf1 by its chaperone-like property. gtf2 interacted with gtf1, mediated the subcellular localization of gtf1, and stabilized gtf1. deletion of invariable amino acid residues in a conserved domain of unknown function (duf1975) at the n  terminus of gtf2 had a greater impact on fap1 glycosylation than deletion of the  c-terminal non-duf1975 residues. the duf1975 deletions concurrently reduced the interaction between gtf1 and gtf2, altered the subcellular localization of gtf1,  and destabilized gtf1, suggesting that duf1975 is crucial for the chaperone activity of gtf2. homologous gtfa and gtfb from streptococcus agalactiae rescued  the glycosylation defect in the gtf1gtf2 mutant; like gtf2, gtfb also possesses chaperone-like activity. taken together, our studies suggest that gtf2 and its homologs possess the conserved molecular chaperone activity that mediates protein glycosylation of bacterial adhesins.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.
