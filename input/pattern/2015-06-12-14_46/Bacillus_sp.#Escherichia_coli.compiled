TI  - Isolation of lactic acid bacteria showing anti-oxidative and probiotic activities from kimchi and infant feces.
AB  - The purpose of this study aimed to investigate the lactic acid bacteria with anti-oxidative and probiotic activities isolated from Korean healthy infant feces and kimchi. A1, A2, S1, S2, and S3 isolates were assigned to Lactobacillus sp. A3, A4, E1, E2, E3, and E4 isolates were assigned to Leuconostoc sp. on the basis of their physiological properties and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. Most strains were confirmed as safe bio resources through non-hemolytic activities and non-production of harmful enzymes such as beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and tryptophanase etc. Isolated 11 strains showed different resistant to acid and bile acids. In addition, 11 strains exhibited antibacterial activity against food-borne bacteria, especially Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, all strains showed the highest levels of hydrophobicity. The antioxidant effects of 11 strains culture filtrate include 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity, 2.2'-azino-bis (2-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation scavenging activity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The results revealed that most strains culture filtrate have effectively scavenging activity at DPPH and ABTS radicals. All strains appeared effectively superoxide dismutase activity. In conclusion, isolated strains A1, A3, S1, and S3 have good probiotic activities applicable to the development for functional foods and health-related products. Also these might be contributed to prevent and control several disease associated with oxidative stress using as probiotics.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Streptomyces polymachus sp. nov. isolated from soil.
AB  - Strain T258T was isolated from the forest soil at Bongnae Falls, South Korea. The strain exhibited antimicrobial and antifungal activity against the following strains: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Paenibacillus larvae, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. Growth occurred on all tested ISP media (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), Czapek-Dox agar, potato dextrose agar, trypticase soy agar, Bennett's modified agar, and nutrient agar at 28 degrees C. Aerial spores were produced solely on ISP Medium 4; the colour of the aerial mycelia were white and the substrate mycelia were ivory. Melanin production was negative on peptone-yeast extract iron agar (ISP Medium 6). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, and glycine. Whole-cell hydrolysates contained glucose, ribose, and galactose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8) while the minor menaquinone was MK-10(H2). The polar lipids included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. The major fatty acids (>10 %) were C16:0 (29.8 %), summed feature 3 (C16:1omega7c and/or C16:1omega6c) (15.1 %), anteiso-C15:0 (13.5 %), and iso-C15:0 (10.3 %). DNA-DNA similarity with other strains ranged between 37.84 +/- 1.15 % to 50.25 +/- 1.91 %. Based on these data, we suggest that strain T258T is a novel species that belong to the genus Streptomyces, for which we propose a name Streptomyces polymachus sp. nov. The type strain is T258T (=KACC 18247T=KEMB 9005-212T=NBRC 110905T).
TI  - Identification of a heterologous cellulase and its N-terminus that can guide recombinant proteins out of Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli has been widely used as  a cell factory for the production of proteins and specialty chemicals because it is the best characterized host with many available expression and regulation systems. However, recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli are generally intracellular and often found in the form of inclusion bodies. Extracellular production of proteins is advantageous compared with intracellular production because extracellular proteins can be purified more easily and can avoid protease attack, which results in higher product quality. In this study, we found a catalytic domain of a cellulase (Cel-CD) and its N-terminus can be employed as carriers for extracellular production of recombinant proteins. RESULTS: In this report, we identified the catalytic domain of a cellulase (Cel-CD) from Bacillus sp. that can be secreted into the medium from recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) in large quantities without its native signal peptide. By subcellular location analysis, we proved that the secretion was a two-step process and the N-terminal sequence of the full length Cel-CD played a crucial function in secretion. Both the Cel-CD and its N-terminal sequence can serve as carriers for efficient extracellular production of select target proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Fusion of heterologous proteins with N20 from Cel-CD can carry the target proteins out of the cells with a concentration from 101 to 691 mg/L in flask cultivation. The extracellular recombinant proteins with a relative high purity. The results suggested that this system has a potential application in plant biomass conversion and industrial production of enzymes and therapeutic proteins.
TI  - A rapid and miniaturized method for the selection of microbial phenol degraders using colourimetric microtitration.
AB  - A high-throughput method is described, consisting of a colourimetric microtitration for screening phenol-degrading microorganisms, using a mixture of 4-aminoantipyrine and potassium ferricyanide as the colour indicator. This contemporary study summarizes a new method to determine phenol-degrading bacteria isolated from different areas. The method was used for testing a total of 72 bacteria collected from the natural environment and five known strains obtained from diagnostic and research laboratories employing 200 mg/L phenol (the linear range saturation concentration). Depending on the change in colour indicator, the degradation profiles of 11 strains of bacteria are shown, of which seven strains were able to degrade more than 80 % of phenol within 6-8 h, while the other four strains took 12-24 h. Two of the environmentally isolated strains showed high efficiency of phenol degradation and were confirmed by the high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. These strains were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as unique (Escherichia coli moh1 and Bacillus cereus moh2) and were deposited in the GenBank of NCBI. Two pathogenic strains (Uropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella sp.) were found to be the fast degraders of phenol, which is of medical concern, as phenol is generally used as a disinfectant in hospitals. This method can be used for the estimation and screening of phenol degraders in a single step, for its application in bioremediation as well as in hospitals for screening the phenol resistance of pathogens.
TI  - Functional gene-based discovery of phenazines from the actinobacteria associated  with marine sponges in the South China Sea.
AB  - Phenazines represent a large group of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds  produced by the diverse group of bacteria including actinobacteria. In this study, a total of 197 actinobacterial strains were isolated from seven different marine sponge species in the South China Sea using five different culture media. Eighty-seven morphologically different actinobacterial strains were selected and grouped into 13 genera, including Actinoalloteichus, Kocuria, Micrococcus, Micromonospora, Mycobacterium, Nocardiopsis, Prauserella, Rhodococcus, Saccharopolyspora, Salinispora, Serinicoccus, and Streptomyces by the phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene. Based on the screening of phzE genes, ten strains, including five Streptomyces, two Nocardiopsis, one Salinispora, one Micrococcus, and one Serinicoccus were found to be potential for phenazine production. The level of phzE gene expression was highly expressed in Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15, 13-12-13, and Serinicoccus sp. 13-12-4 on the fifth day of fermentation. Finally, 1,6-dihydroxy phenazine (1) from Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 and 13-12-13, and 1,6-dimethoxy phenazine (2) from Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 were isolated and identified successfully based on ESI-MS and NMR analysis. The compounds 1 and 2 showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus mycoides SJ14, Staphylococcus aureus SJ51, Escherichia coli SJ42, and Micrococcus luteus SJ47. This study suggests that the integrated approach of gene screening and chemical analysis is an effective strategy to find the target compounds and lays the basis for the production of phenazine from the sponge-associated actinobacteria.
TI  - Crystal structure, complexation, spectroscopic characterization and antimicrobial evaluation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene isonicotinyl-hydrazone.
AB  - A single crystal of 3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene isonicotinylhydrazone, HBINH, has been grown and solved by X-ray crystallography. The VO(2+), Zr(4+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Hg(2+) and Pd(2+) complexes of HBINH have been prepared and spectroscopically characterized. The data confirmed the formulae [Co(HBINH)(H2O)Cl]Cl.H2O, [Pd(HBINH)Cl2], [Zn(HBINH)2Cl2], [Cd(HBINH)(H2O)2Cl2].1(1/2)H2O, [(VO)2(HBINH-3H)(OH)(H2O)], [Ni2(HBINH)(H2O)6Cl2]Cl2, [Cu2(HBINH-3H)(H2O)2(OAc)].3H2O, [Zr2(HBINH-3H)Cl4]Cl, [Hg2(HBINH)Cl4] and the dimer {[Cu(HBINH)Cl]Cl}2. Most of the complexes have intense colors and high melting points and some are electrolytes in DMSO solution. The ligand behaves as a neutral bidentate in the Co(II), Cu(II), Pd(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes; dibasic tetradentate in [Ni2(HBINH)(H2O)6Cl2]Cl2 and tribasic tetradentate in [Cu2(HBINH-3H)(OAc)].5H2O, [(VO)2(HBINH-3H)(OH)(H2O)] and [Zr2(HBINH-3H)Cl4]Cl by the loss of 3H(+) due to the deprotonation of the two hydroxyl groups and the enolization of the amide (OCNH) group. A tetrahedral geometry was proposed for the Co(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Hg(II) complexes; square-planar for the Pd(II) complex; square-pyramid for the VO(2+) complex and octahedral for the Ni(II) and Cd(II) complexes. The complexes [Cd(HBINH)(H2O)2Cl2].1(1/2)H2O, [(VO)2(HBINH-3H)(OH)(H2O)] and [Cu2(HBINH-3H)-(H2O)2(OAc)].3H2O have activities against Bacillus sp. M3010, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Slamonella sp. PA393.
TI  - Properties of a newly identified esterase from Bacillus sp. K91 and its novel function in diisobutyl phthalate degradation.
AB  - The widely used plasticizer phthalate esters (PAEs) have become a public concern  because of their effects on environmental contamination and toxicity on mammals. However, the biodegradation of PAEs, especially diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), remains poorly understood. In particular, genes involved in the hydrolysis of these compounds were not conclusively identified. In this study, the CarEW gene, which encodes an enzyme that is capable of hydrolyzing rho-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids, was cloned from a thermophilic bacterium Bacillus sp. K91 and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using the pEASY-E2 expression system. The enzyme showed a monomeric structure with a molecular mass of approximately 53.76 kDa and pI of 4.88. The enzyme exhibited maximal activity at pH 7.5 and 45 degrees C, with rho-NP butyrate as the best substrate. The enzyme was fairly stable within the pH range from 7.0 to 8.5. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) were employed to detect the catabolic pathway of DiBP. Two intermediate products were identified, and a potential biodegradation pathway was proposed. Altogether, our findings present a novel DiBP degradation enzyme and indicate that the purified enzyme may be a promising candidate for DiBP detoxification and for environmental protection.
TI  - Identification of novel endophenaside antibiotics produced by Kitasatospora sp. MBT66.
AB  - Actinomycetes are a major source of bioactive secondary metabolites and are a focal point in the search for novel antimicrobial compounds that are needed to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens. Here, we report the discovery of several novel phenazine-type antibiotics produced by Kitasatospora sp. MBT66. These include the novel glycosylated endophenazines A-E (1-5), together with N-prenylated endophenazine F1 (6). Compounds 1 and 3 contain a 2'-O-methylation of the sugar moiety, which is rare in nature and reported for the first time in connection with phenazines. The structures of the new compounds were determined on the basis of their spectral data, including 1D and 2D NMR, HR-MS and the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of phenazines was identified. All phenazine derivatives showed antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis, while compounds 1-3 and 5 also inhibited growth of the Gram-negative Escherichia coli.The Journal of Antibiotics advance online publication, 18 February 2015; doi:10.1038/ja.2015.14.
TI  - Characterization of salt-tolerant beta-glucosidase with increased thermostability under high salinity conditions from Bacillus sp. SJ-10 isolated from jeotgal, a traditional Korean fermented seafood.
AB  - The beta-glucosidase gene, bglC, was cloned from Bacillus sp. SJ-10 isolated from the squid jeotgal. Recombinant BglC protein overexpression was induced in Escherichia coli. The optimal pH and temperature of the enzyme, using p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPbetaGlc) as a substrate, were pH 6 and 40 degrees C, respectively. Enzymatic activity increased by 3.3- and 3.5-fold in the presence of 15 % NaCl and KCl, respectively. Furthermore, enzyme thermostability improved in the presence of NaCl or KCl. At 45 degrees C in the presence of salts, the enzyme was stable for 2 h and maintained 80 % activity. In the absence of salts, BglC completely lost activity after 110 min at 45 degrees C. Comparison of the kinetic parameters at various salt concentrations revealed that BglC had approximately 1.5- and 1.2-fold higher affinity and hydrolyzed pNPbetaGlc 1.9- and 2.1-fold faster in the presence of 15 % NaCl and KCl, respectively. Additionally, the Gibb's free energy for denaturation was higher in the presence of 15 % salt than in the absence of salt at 45 and 50 degrees C. Since enzymatic activity and thermostability were enhanced under high salinity conditions, BglC is an ideal salt-tolerant enzyme for further research and industrial applications.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - Purification and identification of an antibacterial protein from the symbiotic bacteria associated with novel entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp.
AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) belonging to the families steinernematidae and heterorhabditidae and their symbiotic bacteria Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus are well-known as biological control agents and are found to produce a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites. Studies carried out at the Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI) on entomopathogenic nematodes resulted in the identification of novel EPN belonging to the family Rhabditidae. This study reports the purification of a high molecular weight antibacterial protein from culture filtrates of a bacterium (Bacillus cereus) symbiotically associated with a novel entomopathogenic nematode Rhabditis (Oscheius) species, maintained at CTCRI laboratory. Fermentation conditions were standardized and optimum antibacterial activity was observed in tryptic soy broth after 48 h incubation at 30 degrees C. The aqueous extracts yielded antibacterial proteins which were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Native gel electrophoresis indicated an active protein of molecular mass 220KDa which resolved into a major band of 90 kDa and a minor band of about 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The 90 kDa protein showed antibacterial activity and was further analysed by MALDI TOF-MS/MS. The protein was identified as a TQXA (Threonine-glutamine dipeptide) domain containing protein from Bacillus cereus. The protein was found to be active against Bacillus subtilis MTCC2756, Staphylococus aureus MTCC902 and Escherichia coli MTCC 2622 and was thermally stable.
TI  - Development of a chimeric hemicellulase to enhance the xylose production and thermotolerance.
AB  - Xylan is an abundant plant cell wall polysaccharide and its reduction to xylose units for subsequent biotechnological applications requires a combination of distinct hemicellulases and auxiliary enzymes, mainly endo-xylanases and ss-xylosidases. In the present work, a bifunctional enzyme consisting of a GH11 endo-1,4-beta-xylanase fused to a GH43 beta-xylosidase, both from Bacillus subtilis, was designed taking into account the quaternary arrangement and accessibility to the substrate. The parental enzymes and the resulting chimera were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized. Interestingly, the substrate cleavage rate was altered by the molecular fusion improving at least 3-fold the xylose production using specific substrates as beechwood xylan and hemicelluloses from pretreated biomass. Moreover, the chimeric enzyme showed higher thermotolerance with a positive shift of the optimum temperature from 35 to 50 degrees C for xylosidase activity. This improvement in the thermal stability was also observed by circular dichroism unfolding studies, which seems to be related to a gain of stability of the beta-xylosidase domain. These results demonstrate the superior functional and stability properties of the chimeric enzyme in comparison to individual parental domains, suggesting the molecular fusion as a promising strategy for enhancing enzyme cocktails aiming at lignocellulose hydrolysis.
TI  - Extracellular overexpression of chitosanase from Bacillus sp. TS in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The chitosanase gene from a Bacillus sp. strain isolated from soil in East China  was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene had 1224 nucleotides and encoded a mature protein of 407 amino acid residues. The optimum pH and temperature of the purified recombinant chitosanase were 5.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively, and the enzyme was stable below 40 degrees C. The K m, V max, and specific activity of the enzyme were 1.19 mg mL(-1), 674.71 mumol min(-1) at 50 degrees C, and 555.3 U mg(-1), respectively. Mn(2+) was an activator of the recombinant chitosanase, while Co(2+) was an inhibitor. Hg(2+) and Cu(2+) inhibited the enzyme at 1 mM. The highest level of enzyme activity (186 U mL(-1)) was achieved in culture medium using high cell-density cultivation in a 7-L fermenter. The main products of chitosan hydrolyzed by recombinant chitosanase were (GlcN)3-6. The chitosanases was successfully secreted to the culture media through the widely used SecB-dependent type II pathway in E. coli. The high yield of the extracellular overexpression, relevant thermostability, and effective hydrolysis of commercial grade chitosan showed that this recombinant enzyme had a great potential for industrial applications.
TI  - Genetic and genomic analysis of RNases in model cyanobacteria.
AB  - Cyanobacteria are diverse photosynthetic microbes with the ability to convert CO2 into useful products. However, metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria remains challenging because of the limited resources for modifying the expression of endogenous and exogenous biochemical pathways. Fine-tuned control of protein production will be critical to optimize the biological conversion of CO2 into desirable molecules. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are labile intermediates that play critical roles in determining the translation rate and steady-state protein concentrations in the cell. The majority of studies on mRNA turnover have focused on the model heterotrophic bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. These studies have elucidated many RNA modifying and processing enzymes and have highlighted the differences between these Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. In contrast, much less is known about mRNA turnover in cyanobacteria. We generated a compendium of the major ribonucleases (RNases) and provide an in-depth analysis of RNase III-like enzymes in commonly studied and diverse cyanobacteria. Furthermore, using targeted gene deletion, we genetically dissected the RNases in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, one of the fastest growing and industrially attractive cyanobacterial strains. We found that all three cyanobacterial homologs of RNase III and a member of the RNase II/R family are not essential under standard laboratory conditions, while homologs of RNase E/G, RNase J1/J2, PNPase, and a different member of the RNase II/R family appear to be essential for growth. This work will enhance our understanding of native control of gene expression and will facilitate the development of an RNA-based toolkit for metabolic engineering in cyanobacteria.
TI  - Crosstalk between the microbiome and cancer cells by quorum sensing peptides.
AB  - To date, the precise role of the human microbiome in health and disease states remains largely undefined. Complex and selective crosstalk systems between the microbiome and mammalian cells are also not yet reported. Research up till now mainly focused on bacterial synthesis of virulence factors, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and hydrogen sulphide, as well as on the activation of exogenous mutagen precursors by intestinal bacteria. We discovered that certain quorum sensing peptides, produced by bacteria, interact with mammalian cells, in casu cancer cells: Phr0662 (Bacillus sp.), EntF-metabolite (Enterococcus faecium) and EDF-derived (Escherichia coli) peptides initiate HCT-8/E11 colon cancer cell invasion, with Phr0662 also promoting angiogenesis. Our findings thus indicate that the human microbiome, through their quorum sensing peptides, may be one of the factors responsible for cancer metastasis.
TI  - Bacillus polymachus sp. nov., with a broad range of antibacterial activity, isolated from forest topsoil samples by using a modified culture method.
AB  - A new, modified culture method that utilizes a transwell plate with a 0.4 microm  pore-size microporous membrane was developed. This system allows only trace nutrients from the soil into the liquid culture through the microporous membrane. The method is a more powerful tool for the discovery of novel species from soils than are traditional methods. Such newly identified species could potentially produce useful metabolites. A bacterial strain, T515(T), was isolated using this modified culture method. Growth of strain T515(T) occurred at pH 4-9 in a temperature range between 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C and in the presence of 0-2 % (w/v) NaCl on R2A agar. Colonies on the agar plates were tiny, white, and convex after 5 days incubation at 28 degrees C. Comparative analysis of the nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain T515(T) revealed close pairwise similarity with species of the genus Bacillus, and strain T515(T) was most closely related to Bacillus panaciterrae Gsoil 1517(T) (96.7 %) and Bacillus funiculus NAF001(T) (96.0 %). The major quinone of strain T515(T) was menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and the major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 (45.5 %), anteiso-C15 : 0 (23.2 %) and C16 : 0 (10.9 %). The predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Strain T515(T) was sensitive to streptomycin and tetracycline, but resistant to rifampicin (0.125 microg ml(-1)), ampicillin (0.5 microg ml(-1)) and chloramphenicol (1 microg ml(-1)). The strain showed antimicrobial activities against the six strains tested: Bacillus subtilis KEMB 51201-001, Staphylococcus aureus KEMB 4659, Pseudomonas aeruginosa KACC 10185, Staphylococcus epidermidis KACC 13234, Paenibacillus larvae KACC 14031 and Escherichia coli KEMB 212-234. Based on these results, strain T515(T) represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus with the proposed name, Bacillus polymachus sp. nov. The type strain is T515(T) ( = KEMB 9005-168(T) = KACC 18242(T) = NBRC 110614(T)).
TI  - Preparation, purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of dual-domain beta-propeller phytase from Bacillus sp. HJB17.
AB  - beta-Propeller phytases (BPPs) are abundant in nature. Recently, dual-domain BPPs have been found in which the typical BPP domain is responsible for phytate hydrolysis. The dual-domain BPP (PhyH) from Bacillus sp. HJB17 was obtained with an incomplete N-terminal BPP domain (PhyH-DI; residues 41-318) and a typical BPP domain (PhyH-DII; residues 319-644) at the C-terminus. PhyH-DI was found to act synergistically (with a 1.2-2.5-fold increase in phosphate release) with PhyH-DII, other BPPs (PhyP and 168PhyA) and a histidine acid phosphatase. The structure of PhyH was therefore studied with the aim of explaining these functions. PhyH with the secreted signal peptide of the first 40 amino acids deleted (PhyHT) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified and active PhyHT protein was obtained by refolding from the precipitant. PhyHT was crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method. The crystal grew in a condition consisting of 0.2 M sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 25%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 using 1 mg ml(-1) protein solution at 289 K. A complete data set was collected from a crystal to 2.85 A resolution using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The crystal belonged to space group P1211, with unit-cell parameters a = 46.82, b = 140.19, c = 81.94 A, alpha = 90.00, beta = 92.00, gamma = 90.00 degrees . The asymmetric unit was estimated to contain one molecule of PhyHT.
TI  - A halotolerant thermostable lipase from the marine bacterium Oceanobacillus sp. PUMB02 with an ability to disrupt bacterial biofilms.
AB  - A halotolerant thermostable lipase was purified and characterized from the marine bacterium Oceanobacillus sp. PUMB02. This lipase displayed a high degree of stability over a wide range of conditions including pH, salinity, and temperature. It was optimally active at 30 degrees C and pH 8.0 respectively and was stable at higher temperatures (50-70 degrees C) and alkaline pH. The molecular mass of the lipase was approximately 31 kDa based on SDS-PAGE and MALDI-ToF fingerprint analysis. Conditions for enhanced production of lipase by Oceanobacillus sp. PUMB02 were attained in response surface method-guided optimization with factors such as olive oil, sucrose, potassium chromate, and NaCl being evaluated, resulting in levels of 58.84 U/ml being achieved. The biofilm disruption potential of the PUMB02 lipase was evaluated and compared with a marine sponge metagenome derived halotolerant lipase Lpc53E1. Good biofilm disruption activity was observed with both lipases against potential food pathogens such as Bacillus cereus MTCC1272, Listeria sp. MTCC1143, Serratia sp. MTCC4822, Escherichia coli MTCC443, Pseudomonas fluorescens MTCC1748, and Vibrio parahemolyticus MTCC459. Phase contrast microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed very effective disruption of pathogenic biofilms. This study reveals that marine derived hydrolytic enzymes such as lipases may have potential utility in inhibiting biofilm formation in a food processing environment and is the first report of the potential application of lipases from the genus Oceanobacillus in biofilm disruption strategies.
TI  - Chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  - The essential oil (EO) composition of ripe fruit of S. terebinthifolius Raddi was analyzed by GC-MS. The oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). Seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). The major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). Trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Corynebacterium sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacillus sp., Nocardia sp. and Streptococcus group D). The essential oil of the ripe fruit of S. terebinthifolius Raddi has shown to be active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/mL to 56.86 mug/mL. However, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, Gram-positive species showed greater sensitivity to the action of EO, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant heterotrophic plate count bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria in aquifers of the Mooi River, North West province, South Africa.
AB  - Groundwater in the Mooi River catchment is prone to mining, agricultural, municipal and septic tank pollution. In this study physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were determined using appropriate methods. Bacterial isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing (heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria (ARB)) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Escherichia coli). Antibiotic resistance tests were also performed. Physico-chemical parameters were generally within target water quality ranges for drinking water. HPC bacteria ranged between 10(5) and 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. E. coli were enumerated from Trimpark, School and Cemetery. The Blaauwbank borehole was negative for faecal streptococci. Pseudomonas spp. were most abundant in the bulk water. Opportunistic pathogens isolated included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium, Bacillus cereus and Mycobacterium spp. Varying patterns of antibiotic resistance were observed. Most HPC bacterial isolates were resistant to cephalothin and/or amoxicillin and a few were resistant to erythromycin and streptomycin. Pseudomonas spp. was also the most abundant ARB. Other ARBs included Alcaligenes faecalis, Ochrobactrum sp. and Achromobacter sp. ARBs were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and/or amoxicillin compared to HPCs. The presence of E. coli and ARB in these groundwater sources indicates potential human health risks. These risks should be further investigated and quantified, and groundwater should be treated before use.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of Calotropis gigantea L.
AB  - The present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of Calotropis gigantea L. toward biomedical applications. Initially, synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed through UV-Vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (SPR) at 420 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of silver as a major constituent element. X-ray diffractograms displays that the synthesized AgNPs were biphasic crystalline nature. Electron microscopic studies such as Field emission scanning electron microscopic (Fe-SEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that synthesized AgNPs are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. Further, crude latex aqueous extract and synthesized AgNPs were evaluated against different bacterial pathogens such as Bacillus cereus, Enterococci sp, Shigella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized AgNPs exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. Likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized AgNPs against tested HeLa cells. The output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized AgNPs using latex of C. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.
TI  - Biochemical properties and substrate recognition mechanism of GH31 alpha-glucosidase from Bacillus sp. AHU 2001 with broad substrate specificity.
AB  - alpha-Glucosidases are ubiquitous enzymes that hydrolyze the alpha-glucosidic linkage at the non-reducing end of substrates. In this study, we characterized an alpha-glucosidase (BspAG31A) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 31 from Bacillus sp. AHU 2001. Recombinant BspAG31A, produced in Escherichia coli, had high hydrolytic activity toward maltooligosaccharides, kojibiose, nigerose, and neotrehalose. This is the first report of an alpha-glucosidase with high activity toward neotrehalose. The transglucosylation products, nigerose, kojibiose, isomaltose, and neotrehalose, were generated from 440 mm maltose. Substitution of Tyr268, situated on the beta --> alpha loop 1 of BspAG31A, with Trp increased hydrolytic activity toward isomaltose. This mutation reduced the hydrolytic activity toward maltooligosaccharides more than toward kojibiose, nigerose, and neotrehalose. Analysis of the Y173A mutant of BspAG31A showed that Tyr173, situated on the N-terminal domain loop, is associated with the formation of subsite +2. In Y173A, the kcat/Km for maltooligosaccharides slightly decreased with an increasing degree of polymerization compared with wild type. Among the amino acid residues surrounding the substrate binding site, Val543 and Glu545 of BspAG31A were different from the corresponding residues of Bacillus thermoamyloliquefaciens alpha-glucosidase II, which has higher activity toward isomaltose than BspAG31A. The E545G mutation slightly enhanced isomaltase activity without a large reduction of hydrolytic activities toward other substrates. V543A showed 1.8-3.5-fold higher hydrolytic activities toward all substrates other than neotrehalose compared with wild type, although its preference for isomaltose was unchanged.
TI  - Purification of a secreted lectin from Andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - A lectin secreted from Andrias davidianus skin (ADL) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type III) (PSM)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and HPLC on TSK gel G3000PWXL. The purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. SDS-PAGE showed that the ADL protein had a molecular mass of 17 kDa. ADL produced an 8.5 kDa band when examined using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. ADL agglutinated native and trypsinized human B erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as PSM and asialo-PSM, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. The activity was stable between 4 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Significant ADL activity was observed between pH 4-5. The lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation Ca2+ or Mg2+. The N-terminal ADL sequence was determined to be VGYTVGATPM. The lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Shewanella sp. Furthermore, ADL showed inhibition activity against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These findings suggest that ADL plays an important role in the innate immunity of A. davidianus on the body surface.
TI  - Antibiotic oxylipins from Alternanthera brasiliana and its endophytic bacteria.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of Alternanthera brasiliana stem extracts resulted  in the isolation of an antibiotically active fraction. Five human pathogenic bacteria were used to guide the fractionation process for the isolation of antimicrobial compounds. Finally, 17 linoleate oxylipins were identified by LC-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. Five of the isolated compounds present in A. brasiliana tissues were also detected to be synthesized by endophytic bacteria of the genus Bacillus that were isolated from A. brasiliana. It is speculated that the antibiotic oxylipins from A. brasiliana might derive from bacteria and be involved in an ecological relationship between this plant and its endophytes.
TI  - Synergistic action modes of arabinan degradation by exo- and endo-arabinosyl hydrolases.
AB  - Two recombinant arabinosyl hydrolases, alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Geobacillus sp. KCTC 3012 (GAFase) and endo-(1,5)-alpha-L-arabinanase from Bacillus licheniformis DSM13 (BlABNase), were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and their synergistic modes of action against sugar beet (branched) arabinan were investigated. Whereas GAFase hydrolyzed 35.9% of L-arabinose residues from sugar beet (branched) arabinan, endo-action of BlABNase released only 0.5% of L-arabinose owing to its extremely low accessibility towards branched arabinan. Interestingly, the simultaneous treatment of GAFase and BlABNase could liberate approximately 91.2% of L-arabinose from arabinan, which was significantly higher than any single exo-enzyme treatment (35.9%) or even stepwise exo- after endo-enzyme treatment (75.5%). Based on their unique modes of action, both exo- and endo-arabinosyl hydrolases can work in concert to catalyze the hydrolysis of arabinan to L-arabinose. At the early stage in arabinan degradation, exo-acting GAFase could remove the terminal arabinose branches to generate debranched arabinan, which could be successively hydrolyzed into arabinooligosaccharides via the endoaction of BlABNase. At the final stage, the simultaneous actions of exo- and endo-hydrolases could synergistically accelerate the L-arabinose production with high conversion yield.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of a GDSL-motif esterase from Bacillus sp. K91 with  a new putative catalytic mechanism.
AB  - The esterase gene Est8 from the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus sp. K91 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The monomeric enzyme exhibited a theoretical molecular mass of 24.5 kDa and an optimal activity around 50 degrees C at pH 9.0. A model of Est8 was constructed using a hypothetical YxiM precursor structure (2O14_A) from Bacillus subtilis as template. The structure showed an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and indicated the presence of a typical catalytic triad consisting of Ser-11, Asp-182, and His-185, which were investigated by site-directed replacements coupled with kinetic characterization. Asp-182 and His-185 residues were more critical than the Ser-11 residue in the catalytic activity of Est8. A comparison of the amino acid sequence showed that Est8 could be grouped into the GDSL family and further classified as an SGNH hydrolase. Est8 is a new member of the SGNH hydrolase subfamily and may employ a different catalytic mechanism.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a thermostable lipase from deep-sea thermophile Geobacillus sp. EPT9.
AB  - A gene (1,254 bp) encoding a lipase was identified from a deep-sea hydrothermal field thermophile Geobacillus sp. EPT9. The open reading frame of this gene encoded 417 amino acid residues. The gene was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the target protein was purified to homogeneity. The purified recombinant enzyme presented a molecular mass of 44.8 kDa. When p-nitrophenyl palmitate was used as a substrate, the recombinant lipase was optimally active at 55 degrees C and pH 8.5. The recombinant enzyme retained 44 % residual activity after incubation at 80 degrees C for 1 h, which indicated that Geobacillus sp. EPT9 lipase was thermostable. Homology modeling of strain EPT9 lipase was developed with the lipase from Bacillus sp. L2 as a template. The core structure exhibits an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and the typical catalytic triad might consist of Ser142, Asp346, and His387. The enzymatic activity of EPT9 lipase was inhibited by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that it contains serine residue, which plays an important role in the catalytic mechanism.
TI  - Molecular Characterization of a Thermophilic and Salt- and Alkaline-Tolerant Xylanase from Planococcus sp. SL4, a Strain Isolated from the Sediment of a Soda Lake.
AB  - To enrich the genetic resource of microbial xylanases with high activity and stability under alkaline conditions, a xylanase gene (xynSL4) was cloned from Planococcus sp. SL4, an alkaline xylanase-producing strain isolated from the sediment of soda lake Dabusu. Deduced XynSL4 consists of a putative signal peptide of 29 residues and a catalytic domain (30-380 residues) of glycosyl hydrolase family 10, and shares the highest identity of 77% with a hypothetical protein from Planomicrobium glaciei CHR43. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that deduced XynSL4 is closely related with thermophilic and alkaline xylanases from Geobacillus and Bacillus species. The gene xynSL4 was expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli and the recombinant enzyme showed some superior properties. Purified recombinant XynSL4 (rXynSL4) was highly active and stable over the neutral and alkaline pH range from 6 to 11, with maximum activity at pH 7 and more than 60% activity at pH 11. It had an apparent temperature optimum of 70 degrees C and retained stable at this temperature in the presence of substrate. rXynSL4 was highly halotolerant, retaining more than 55% activity with 0.25-3.0 M NaCl and was stable at the concentration of NaCl up to 4M. The enzyme activity was significantly enhanced by beta-mercaptoethanol and Ca(2+) but strongly inhibited by heavy-metal ions and SDS. This thermophilic and alkaline- and salt-tolerant enzyme has great potential for basic research and industrial applications.
TI  - Photochromic conversion in a red/green cyanobacteriochrome from Synechocystis PCC6803: quantum yields in solution and photoswitching dynamics in living E. coli cells.
AB  - The protein encoded by the gene slr1393 from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Slr1393) is composed of three GAF domains, a PAS domain, and a histidine kinase motif. The third GAF domain (referred to as GAF3) was previously characterized as the sole domain in this protein, being able to carry phycocyanobilin (PCB) as the chromophore and to accomplish photochemistry. GAF3 shows photochromicity, and is able to switch between a red-absorbing parental state (GAF3R, lambdamax = 649 nm) and a green-absorbing photoproduct state (GAF3G, lambdamax = 536 nm) upon appropriate irradiation. In this study we have determined the photochemical quantum yields for the interconversion between both forms using two methods: an "absolute" method and a reference-based control. The latter is a comparative procedure which exploits a well-characterized blue-light photoreceptor, YtvA from Bacillus subtilis, and the cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 as actinometers. The former is an ad hoc developed, four laser-based setup where two cw lasers provide the pump beams to induce photoswitching (red to green and green to red, respectively) and two cw lasers simultaneously monitor the appearance and disappearance of the two species. Interestingly, fit analysis of the recorded transient absorbance changes provided a quantum yield for the green --> red conversion ( approximately 0.3) at least three times larger than for the red --> green conversion ( approximately 0.08). These data are in agreement with the results from the comparative method documenting the usefulness of the 'direct' method developed here for quantum yields' determination. The light-induced switching capability of this photochromic protein allowed measuring the kinetics of GAF3 immobilized on a glass plate, and within living, overexpressing Escherichia coli cells.
TI  - Antibacterial secondary metabolites from an endophytic fungus, Eupenicillium sp.  LG41.
AB  - Two new compounds containing the decalin moiety, eupenicinicols A and B (1 and 2), two new sirenin derivatives, eupenicisirenins A and B (3 and 4), and four known compounds, (2S)-butylitaconic acid (5), (2S)-hexylitaconic acid (6), xanthomegnin (7), and viridicatumtoxin (8), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, Eupenicillium sp. LG41, harbored in the roots of the Chinese medicinal plant Xanthium sibiricum. Their structures were confirmed through combined spectroscopic analysis (NMR and HRMS(n)), and their absolute configurations were deduced by ECD calculations or optical rotation data. Since the endophytic fungus was isolated from the roots, the antibacterial efficacies of the compounds 1-6 were investigated against Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter sp. BD4, which typically inhabit soil, as well as the clinically important Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. (2S)-Butylitaconic acid (5) and (2S)-hexylitaconic acid (6) exhibited pronounced efficacy against Acinetobacter sp., corroborating the notion that root-endophytes provide chemical defense to the host plants. Compound 2 was highly active against the clinically relevant S. aureus. By comparing 1 with 2, it was revealed that altering the substitution at C-11 could drastically increase the antibacterial efficacy of 1. Our study reveals plausible ecological roles of the endophyte and its potential pharmaceutical use as a source of antibacterial compounds.
TI  - In Vitro Antibacterial Activity and Mechanism of Silver Nanoparticles against Foodborne Pathogens.
AB  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using Planomicrobium sp. and to explore the  antibacterial activity against food borne pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, (3053) Klebsiella planticola (2727) Klebsiella pneumoniae (MAA) Serratia nematodiphila (CAA) and Escherichia coli. In the current studies, 1 mM of silver nitrate was added into 100 mL of Planomicrobium sp. culture supernatant. The bioreduction of pure AgNO3 was characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive analysis (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis. The formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by the presence of an absorption peak at 400 nm using UV-visible spectrophotometry. The morphology and size of the silver nanoparticles was monitored by TEM and SEM. Crystal structure was obtained by carrying out X-ray diffraction studies and it showed face centered cubic (FCC) structure. The bactericidal effect of silver nanoparticles was compared based on diameter of inhibition zone in well method. Bacterial sensitivity to nanoparticles a key factor in manufacture the suitable for long life application in food packaging and food safety. Food safety is a worldwide health goal and the food borne diseases get a main disaster on health. Therefore, controlling of bacterial pathogens in food is credit of harms associated to health and safety.
TI  - Antimicrobial constituents from three endophytic fungi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial potential of extracts of the endophytic  fungi Plectophomella sp., Physalospora sp., and Crataegus monogyna (C. monogyna) and study the tentative identification of their active constituents. METHODS: Crude extracts and isolated compounds were screened for antimicrobial activity using the agar well diffusion method. Four compounds were purified from three endophytic fungi using column chromatography and their structures have been assigned based on their (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. RESULTS: Plectophomella sp., Physalospora sp., and C. monogyna extracts showed promising antifungal, antibacterial and herbicidal properties. (-)-Mycorrhizin A was isolated from Plectophomella sp. while cytochalasins E and K were isolated from Physalospora sp. Similarly radicinin was purified from the endophytic fungus C. monogyna. The ethyl acetate extract of Plectophomella sp. showed significant antifungal activity towards Ustilago violacea (U. violacea) and Eurotium repens (E. repens) and significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus megaterium. Interestingly, the ethyl acetate extracts of Physalospora sp. and C. monogyna showed strong herbicidal and antifungal activities towards Chlorella fusca, U. violacea, E. repens, Mycotypha microspora (M. microspora), Fusarium oxysporum, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus megaterium. (-)-Mycorrhizin A showed significant antifungal activity towards U. violacea and E. repens. Cytochalasins E and K showed strong antifungal activity against E. repens and M. microspora especially towards fungal Mycotypha microspora. Similarly cytochalasins E and K showed good herbicidal activity towards Chlorella fusca. Radicinin showed strong antifungal activity against E. repens and M. microspora. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial activities demonstrated by the extracts of the endophytic fungi Plectophomella sp., Physalospora sp., and C. monogyna and four isolated compounds clearly demonstrate that these fungi extracts and active compounds present a great potential use in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.
TI  - Cold-active and NaCl-tolerant exo-inulinase from a cold-adapted Arthrobacter sp.  MN8 and its potential for use in the production of fructose at low temperatures.
AB  - An exo-inulinase gene was cloned from Arthrobacter sp. MN8, a cold-adapted bacterium isolated from lead-zinc-rich soil. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The resultant 505-residue polypeptide (InuAMN8) showed the highest identity (81.1%) with the putative levanase from Arthrobacter phenanthrenivorans Sphe3 (ADX73279) and shared 57.8% identity with the exo-inulinase from Bacillus sp. snu-7 (AAK00768). The purified recombinant InuAMN8 (rInuAMN8) showed an apparently optimal activity at 35 degrees C, and 75.3%, 39.4%, and 15.8% of its maximum activity at 20 degrees C, 10 degrees C, and 0 degrees C, respectively. After pre-incubation for 60 min at 50 degrees C and 55 degrees C, the rInuAMN8 exhibited 69.8% and 17.7% of its initial activity, respectively. The apparent Km values of rInuAMN8 towards inulin were 2.8, 1.5, 1.2, 5.3, and 8.2 mM at 0 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C, respectively. Inulin and Jerusalem artichoke tubers were effectively hydrolyzed to release fructose by rInuAMN8 at 0 degrees C, 10 degrees C, and 35 degrees C. Compared with its hyperthermophilic and thermophilic counterparts, the exo-inulinase had less aromatic amino acid F and more hydrophobic amino acid A. In addition, the purified rInuAMN8 retained 127.9%-88.4% inulinase activity at 3.5%-15.0% (w/v) NaCl concentrations. Zn(2+) and Pb(2+) at 10 mM exhibited little or no effect on the enzyme activity. This paper is the first to report a cold-active and/or NaCl-tolerant exo-inulinase from the genus Arthrobacter. The exo-inulinase rInuAMN8 shows a potential for use in the production of fructose at low temperatures.
TI  - Wollamides: antimycobacterial cyclic hexapeptides from an Australian soil Streptomyces.
AB  - A soil Streptomyces nov. sp. (MST-115088) isolated from semiarid terrain near Wollogorang Station, Queensland, returned two known and two new examples of a rare class of cyclic hexapeptide, desotamides A and B (1 and 2) and E and F (3 and 4), respectively, together with two new d-Orn homologues, wollamides A and B (5 and 6). Structures were assigned by detailed spectroscopic and C3 Marfey's analysis. The desotamides/wollamides exhibit growth inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria (IC50 0.6-7 muM) and are noncytotoxic to mammalian cells (IC50 >30 muM). The wollamides exhibit antimycobacterial activity (IC50 2.8 and 3.1 muM), including reduction in the intracellular mycobacterial survival in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages.
TI  - Structural data and biological properties of almond gum oligosaccharide: application to beef meat preservation.
AB  - Enzymatic hydrolysis of almond gum generates low molecular weight oligosaccharides (OAG) with a yield of 33.5%. The generated oligosaccharides were purified and identified. OAG analyses show that the most prominent residues were galactose and arabinose with traces of xylose, rhamnose, glucose and mannose. The glycosyl linkage positions were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showing a main chain composed of galactose units [ --> 3)-Gal-(1 --> ] branched mainly with arabinose residues [Ara-(1 --> ]. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of OAG were investigated. As regards the in vitro antioxidant activities, the OAG showed a high total antioxidant activity (347 mug ascorbic acid equivalent/mL), an important DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.64 mg/mL) and a high reducing capacity (RP0.5AU = 3.6 mg/mL). Furthermore, OAG had a high antimicrobial activity against Salmonella thyphimirium, Bacillus cereus, Actinomycetes sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Alternaria alternate and Candidat albicans. Finally, OAG efficiency was tested using 0.5%; 0.75% and 1% concentrations in beef meat preservation. Microbial growth and lipid oxidation were monitored during 9 days at 4 degrees C. The results showed significant inhibitions (p < 0.05) of lipid oxidation and microbial growth in ground beef meat containing OAG.
TI  - Biosynthetic pathway for the cyanide-free production of phenylacetonitrile in Escherichia coli by utilizing plant cytochrome P450 79A2 and bacterial aldoxime dehydratase.
AB  - The biosynthetic pathway for the production of phenylacetonitrile (PAN), which has a wide variety of uses in chemical and pharmaceutical industries, was constructed in Escherichia coli utilizing enzymes from the plant glucosinolate-biosynthetic and bacterial aldoxime-nitrile pathways. First, the single-step reaction to produce E,Z-phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx) from l-Phe was constructed in E. coli by introducing the genes encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP) 79A2 and CYP reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana, yielding the E,Z-PAOx-producing transformant. Second, this step was expanded to the production of PAN by further introducing the aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) gene from Bacillus sp. strain OxB-1, yielding the PAN-producing transformant. The E,Z-PAOx-producing transformant also produced phenethyl alcohol and PAN as by-products, which were suggested to be the metabolites of E,Z-PAOx produced by E. coli enzymes, while the PAN-producing transformant accumulated only PAN in the culture broth, which suggested that the CYP79A2 reaction (the conversion of l-Phe to E,Z-PAOx) was a potential bottleneck in the PAN production pathway. Expression of active CYP79A2 and concentration of biomass were improved by the combination of the autoinduction method, coexpression of groE, encoding the heat shock protein GroEL/GroES, N-terminal truncation of CYP79A2, and optimization of the culture conditions, yielding a >60-fold concentration of E,Z-PAOx (up to 2.9 mM). The concentration of PAN was 4.9 mM under the optimized conditions. These achievements show the potential of this bioprocess to produce nitriles and nitrile derivatives in the absence of toxic chemicals.
TI  - Characterization of rumen bacterial strains isolated from enrichments of rumen content in the presence of propolis.
AB  - Propolis presents many biological properties, including antibacterial activities, and has been proposed as an additive in ruminant nutrition. Twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from enrichments of Brazilian cow rumen contents in the presence of different propolis extracts (LLOS), were characterized using phenotyping and 16S rRNA identification. Seven strains were assigned to Streptococcus sp., most likely S. bovis, and were all degrading starch. One amylolytic lactate-utilizing strain of Selenomonas ruminantium was also found. Two strains of Clostridium bifermentans were identified and showed proteolytic activity. Two strains were assigned to Mitsuokella jalaludinii and were saccharolytic. One strain belonged to a Bacillus species and seven strains were affiliated with Escherichia coli. All of the 20 strains were able to use many sugars, but none of them were able to degrade the polysaccharides carboxymethylcellulose and xylans. The effect of three propolis extracts (LLOS B1, C1 and C3) was tested on the in vitro growth of four representative isolates of S. bovis, E. coli, M. jalaludinii and C. bifermentans. The growth of S. bovis, E. coli and M. jalaludinii was not affected by the three propolis extracts at 1 mg ml(-1). C. bifermentans growth was completely inhibited at this LLOS concentration, but this bacterium was partially resistant at lower concentrations. LLOS C3, with the lower concentration of phenolic compounds, was a little less inhibitory than B1 and C1 on this strain.
TI  - Co-expression of D-glucose isomerase and D-psicose 3-epimerase: development of an efficient one-step production of D-psicose.
AB  - D-Psicose has been attracting attention in recent years because of its alimentary activities and is used as an ingredient in a range of foods and dietary supplements. To develop a one-step enzymatic process of D-psicose production, thermoactive D-glucose isomerase and the D-psicose 3-epimerase obtained from Bacillus sp. and Ruminococcus sp., respectively, were successfully co-expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 strain. The substrate of one-step enzymatic process was D-glucose. The co-expression system exhibited maximum activity at 65 degrees C and pH 7.0. Mg(2+) could enhance the output of D-psicose by 2.32 fold to 1.6 g/L from 10 g/L of D-glucose. When using high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as substrate, 135 g/L D-psicose was produced under optimum conditions. The mass ratio of D-glucose, D-fructose, and D-psicose was almost 3.0:2.7:1.0, when the reaction reached equilibrium after an 8h incubation time. This co-expression system approaching to produce D-psicose has potential application in food and beverage products, especially softdrinks.
TI  - Enhanced production of 2,3-butanediol by a genetically engineered Bacillus sp. BRC1 using a hydrolysate of empty palm fruit bunches.
AB  - A Bacillus species that produces 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD), termed BRC1, was newly  isolated, and a 2,3-BD dehydrogenase (Bdh) from this species was identified and characterized at the molecular and biochemical level. Sequence analysis revealed that Bdh is homologous to D-2,3-BD dehydrogenases. An analysis of the enzymatic properties of Bdh overexpressed in Escherichia coli confirmed the molecular results, showing preferred activity toward D-2,3-BD. Optimum pH, temperature, and kinetics determined for reductive and oxidative reactions support the preferential production of 2,3-BD during cell growth. Overexpression of bdh under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter resulted in increased enzyme activity and enhanced 2,3-BD production in Bacillus sp. BRC1. Additionally, a hydrolysate of cellulosic material, (empty palm fruit bunches), was successfully used for the enhanced production of 2,3-BD in the recombinant Bacillus strain.
TI  - The blow fly, Chrysomya megacephala, and the house fly, Musca domestica, as mechanical vectors of pathogenic bacteria in Northeast Thailand.
AB  - The Oriental latrine fly, Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and the house fly, Musca domestica L., (Diptera: Muscidae) are synanthropic flies which are adapted to live in close association with human habitations, thereby making them likely mechanical vectors of several pathogens to humans. There were two main aims of this study. The first aim was to determine the prevalence of these two fly species from five types of human habitations including: fresh-food markets, garbage piles, restaurants, school cafeterias and paddy fields, in the Muang Ubon Ratchathani and Warinchamrap districts of Ubon Ratchathani province of Northeast Thailand. Flies collection were conducted monthly from September 2010-October 2011 using a reconstructable funnel trap, containing 1 day-tainted beef offal as bait. A total of 7 750 flies (6 401 C. megacephala and 1 349 M.domestica) were collected. The second aim was to examine the potential of these flies to carry pathogenic bacteria. Bacteria were isolated from 994 individual flies collected using a sweep net (555 C. megacephala and 439 M. domestica). A total of 15 bacterial genera were isolated from the external surfaces, comprising ten genera of gram-negative bacteria and five gram-positive bacteria. The most common bacteria isolated from both species were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Streptococcus group D non-enterococci. Human pathogenic enteric bacteria isolated were Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus sp., and Enterococcus sp., of which S. typhi is the first report of isolation from these fly species. Other human pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Not only were the number of C. megacephala positive for bacteria significantly higher than for M. domestica, but they were also carrying ~11-12 times greater bacterial load than M. domestica. These data suggest that both fly species should be considered potential mechanical vectors of bacterial pathogens associated with human habitations year-round in this region of Northeast Thailand.
TI  - Penialidins A-C with strong antibacterial activities from Penicillium sp., an endophytic fungus harboring leaves of Garcinia nobilis.
AB  - Three new polyketides named penialidins A-C (1-3), along with one known compound, citromycetin (4), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, Penicillium sp., harbored in the leaves of the Cameroonian medicinal plant Garcinia nobilis. Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic and spectrometric methods (NMR and HRMS(n)). The antibacterial efficacies of the new compounds (1-3) were tested against the clinically-important risk group 2 (RG2) bacterial strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The ecologically imposing strains of E. coli (RG1), Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter sp. BD4 were also included in the assay. Compound 3 exhibited pronounced activity against the clinically-relevant S. aureus as well as against B. subtilis comparable to that of the reference standard (streptomycin). Compound 2 was also highly-active against S. aureus. By comparing the structures of the three new compounds (1-3), it was revealed that altering the substitutions at C-10 and C-2 can significantly increase the antibacterial activity of 1.
TI  - Inducible factors with antimicrobial activity after immune challenge in the haemolymph of Red Palm Weevil (Insecta).
AB  - Insects are capable of innate immune responses elicited after microbial infection. In this process, the receptor-mediated recognition of foreign bodies and the subsequent activation of immunocompetent cells lead to the synthesis ex novo of a peptide pool with antimicrobial activity. We investigated the inducible immune response of a coleopteran, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, challenged with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. After immunization, we evaluated the presence of antimicrobial peptides using either biochemical analyses or microbiological techniques. The antimicrobial properties of the newly synthesized protein pool, detectable in haemolymph fractions of low molecular mass, showed strong antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. OX1, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus). In addition to the preliminary study of the mechanism of action of the pool of antimicrobial peptides, we also investigated its effects on bacterial cell walls by means of fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The data suggest that the main effects seem to be directed at destabilizing and damaging the bacterial wall. This study provides data that help us to understand some aspects of the inducible innate immunity in a system model that lacks anticipatory responses. However, the weevil has finely tuned its defensive strategies to counteract effectively microbial infection.
TI  - Expression and biochemical characterization of a thermophilic organic solvent-tolerant lipase from Bacillus sp. DR90.
AB  - The objective of the present study was the isolation, molecular cloning and biochemical characterization of a thermophilic organic solvent-resistant lipase from Bacillus sp. DR90. The lipase gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) using pET-28a(+) vector. The purification of recombinant lipase was conducted by nickel affinity chromatography and its biochemical properties were determined. The lipase sequence with an ORF of 639 bp contains the conserved pentapeptide Ala-His-Ser-Met-Gly. His-tagged recombinant lipase had a specific activity of 1,126 U/mg with a molecular mass of 26.8 kDa. The cloned lipase was optimally active at pH 8.0 and 75 degrees C representing high stability in broad ranges of temperature and pH. High performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the major compounds released during the lipase-catalyzed reaction of p-nitrophenyl derivatives as well as the substrate specificity. The purified lipase showed high compatibility towards various organic solvents, surfactants and commercial solid/liquid detergents; therefore the recombinant DR90 lipase could be considered as a probable candidate for future applications, predominantly in detergent processing industries.
TI  - Composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts of some Acinos Miller species.
AB  - GC and GC/MS analyses of the methanol extracts obtained from the aerial parts of  six Acinos Miller species from Serbia and Montenegro were performed. Seventy-four constituents, accounting for 84.9-99.0% of the total composition of the extracts, were identified. The common feature of the A. suaveolens, A. majoranifolius and A. alpinus methanol extracts was the high content of monoterpenes, while the common feature of the A. graveolens, A. arvensis and A. hungaricus methanol extracts was the prevalence of sesquiterpenes. The total flavonoids, polyphenols and tannins content, as well as antioxidant activity (FRAP and DPPH assay) of the methanolic extracts were investigated. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in the extract of A. alpinus which had high levels of all polyphenol classes examined. A disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of the extracts against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium pyogenes, Enterococcus sp., Micrococcus flavus, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli; fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The preliminary bioassay results indicated that the methanol extract of A. alpinus could be a possible source of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - In-vitro assessment of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts and essential oil of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Owing to the complexity of the antioxidant materials and their mechanism of actions, it is obvious that no single testing method is capable of providing a comprehensive picture of the antioxidant profile. The essential oil of the Thymus specie may still possess other important activities in traditional medicine, it can be used in the treatment of fever and cough. This essential oil may also have an anticancer activity. METHODS: The essential oils aerial parts hydrodistilled from Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were characterised by GC/MS analysis and the methanolic extracts were chemically characterized by HPLC method. The essence of thyme was evaluated for its antioxidant and antibacterial activity. RESULT: The Terpinen-4-ol are the principal class of metabolites (33.34%) among which 1.8-cineole (19.96%) and camphor (19.20%) predominate. In this study, quantitative values of antioxidant activity of crude methanolic extracts of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis were investigated. The essential oils was screened for their antibacterial activity against six common pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteridis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes) by well diffusion method and agar dilution method (MIC). All the essences were found to inhibit the growth of both gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria organisms tested. These activities were correlated with the presence of phenolic compounds in active fractions. HPLC confirmed presence of phenolic compounds in methanol extracts. CONCLUSION: Methanol extracts and essential oils from aerial parts of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were examined for their potential as antioxidants. The technique for measuring antioxidant activity, which was developed using DPPH, ABTS and beta-carotene bleaching, produced results as found in established literatures. The present results indicate clearly that methanol extracts and essential oils from Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis possess antioxidant properties and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavengers, acting possibly as primary antioxidants, also their essential oil have an antibacterial effect.
TI  - Lumazine peptides penilumamides B-D and the cyclic pentapeptide asperpeptide A from a gorgonian-derived Aspergillus sp. fungus.
AB  - Three new lumazine peptides, penilumamides B-D (2-4), and one known analogue, penilumamide (1), together with a new cyclic pentapeptide, asperpeptide A (5), were isolated from the gorgonian-derived fungus Aspergillus sp. XS-20090B15. Among them, 2 was obtained from the feeding culture with l-methionine of this strain. All structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and chemical derivatization. Compounds 1-4 are rare lumazine peptides, of which 1 and 3 are formed from 2 by oxidation of the l-methionine residue.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and characterization of a novel alkali-tolerant xylanase from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. SN5.
AB  - A xylanase gene (xyn11A) was cloned from the genomic library of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. SN5. It encoded a polypeptide of 366 amino acids, consisting of a family 11 glycoside hydrolase, a short linker region, and a family 36 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). The intact xylanase Xyn11A and the CBM-linker-truncated Xyn11A-LC were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Both purified recombinant proteins exhibited the highest activity at 55 degrees C. The optimal pH for Xyn11A activity was 7.5, whereas Xyn11A-LC showed a broad pH profile (>80% activity at pH 5.5-8.5) with optimal activity at pH 5.5 and 7.5-8.0. They had high alkali tolerance, retaining over 80% residual activity after preincubation at pH 8.5-11.0 at 37 degrees C for 1 H. Xyn11A-LC showed better thermal stability, lower affinity, and lower catalytic activity to insoluble xylan than Xyn11A, whereas its specific activity for soluble beechwood xylan (4,511.9 U/mg) was greater than that of Xyn11A (3,136.4 U/mg). These results implied that the CBM of Xyn11A could change the enzymatic properties and play a role in degrading insoluble xylan. Xyn11A-LC is a family 11 alkali-tolerant cellulase-free xylanase with high specific activity, which qualifies it as a potential candidate for industrial applications, especially in the paper industry.
TI  - FTIR spectroscopy offers hints towards widespread molecular changes in cobalt-acclimated freshwater bacteria.
AB  - High concentrations of heavy metals can be toxic for bacteria. However, after prolonged exposure, bacteria can become acclimated and begin to be able to grow in the presence of heavy metals. Acclimation can involve alterations of metabolism and molecular structures. Our aim was to examine these alterations in cobalt-acclimated bacteria via attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy on viable samples. Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. isolated from a temperate shallow lake and a well-established strain of E. coli were investigated. Our results revealed consistent, wide-spread changes in cell membrane and cell wall dynamics of Bacillus sp. and E. coli, including a decrease in peptidoglycan content of Bacillus sp. and increased lipid ordering of the membrane in both bacteria. Furthermore, a decrease in RNA and protein concentrations of Bacillus sp. was measured. All three bacteria studied showed a decrease in conformational freedom of proteins following cobalt acclimation. Interestingly, both Bacillus sp. and E. coli showed slight but significant alterations in their DNA conformations which might imply a methylation-mediated memory formation leading to epigenetic modulation for cobalt adaptation.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Murrayaquinone A and 6-Methoxy-3,7-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-carbazole-1,4(9H)-dione.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Murrayaquinone A (10), a naturally occurring carbazoloquinone alkaloid, and 6-methoxy-3,7-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-carbazole-1,4(9H)-dione (11), a synthetic carbazoloquinone, both obtained during the development of the synthesis of Carbazomycin G, having unique quinone moiety, was studied against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas sp.) bacteria. Compound 10 showed antibacterial activities against both of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus whereas compound 11 indicated the activity against Staphylococcus aureus only. Both compounds 10 and 11 exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 50 mu g mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activity of Haliclona sp. from the Persian Gulf, Iran.
AB  - In this study, antifungal and antibacterial activities of diethyl ether, methanol and aqueous extracts of Haliclona sp. were assessed (in vitro). The antibacterial activity of the extracts was determined by broth dilution methods against clinical Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus aureus, Bacillus subtilis spizizenii. The antifungal activity of the extracts was determined by using a broth microdilution test against clinical fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Our results showed diethyl ether extract of Haliclona sp. was active on Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, methanol extract in comparison with diethyl ether extract had better activity against C. albicans (MIC: 0.75 mg/mL, MFC: 1.5mg/mL) and A. fumigatus (MIC: 2mg/mL, MFC: 3mg/mL). Aqueous extract had neither antifungal nor antibacterial activities. Based our results, Haliclona sp. can be considered as a source of novel antibiotic and antifungal.
TI  - Comparative analysis of pathogenic organisms in cockroaches from different community settings in Edo State, Nigeria.
AB  - Cockroaches are abundant in Nigeria and are seen to harbour an array of pathogens. Environmental and sanitary conditions associated with demographic/socio-economic settings of an area could contribute to the prevalence of disease pathogens in cockroaches. A total of 246 cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) in urban (Benin, n=91), semi-urban (Ekpoma, n=75) and rural (Emuhi, n=70) settings in Edo State, Nigeria were collected within and around households. The external body surfaces and alimentary canal of these cockroaches were screened for bacterial, fungal, and parasitological infections. Bacillus sp. and Escherichia coli were the most common bacteria in cockroaches. However, Enterococcus faecalis could not be isolated in cockroaches trapped from Ekpoma and Emuhi. Aspergillus niger was the most prevalent fungus in Benin and Ekpoma, while Mucor sp. was predominant in Emuhi. Parasitological investigations revealed the preponderance of Ascaris lumbricoides in Benin and Emuhi, while Trichuris trichura was the most predominant in Ekpoma. The prevalence and burden of infection in cockroaches is likely to be a reflection of the sanitary conditions of these areas. Also, cockroaches in these areas making incursions in homes may increase the risk of human infections with these disease agents.
TI  - X-ray structure of a novel L-ribose isomerase acting on a non-natural sugar L-ribose as its ideal substrate.
AB  - l-Ribose, a pentose, is not known to exist in nature. Although organisms typically do not have a metabolic pathway that uses l-ribose as a carbon source, prokaryotes use various sugars as carbon sources for survival. Acinetobacter sp. DL-28 has been shown to express the novel enzyme, l-ribose isomerase (AcL-RbI), which catalyzes reversible isomerization between l-ribose and l-ribulose. AcL-RbI showed the highest activity to l-ribose, followed by d-lyxose with 47% activity, and had no significant amino acid sequence similarity to structure-known proteins, except for weak homology with the d-lyxose isomerases from Escherichia coli O157 : H7 (18%) and Bacillus subtilis strain (19%). Thus, AcL-RbI is expected to have the unique three-dimensional structure to recognize l-ribose as its ideal substrate. The X-ray structures of AcL-RbI in complexes with substrates were determined. AcL-RbI had a cupin-type beta-barrel structure, and the catalytic site was found between two large beta-sheets with a bound metal ion. The catalytic site structures clearly showed that AcL-RbI adopted a cis-enediol intermediate mechanism for the isomerization reaction using two glutamate residues (Glu113 and Glu204) as acid/base catalysts. In its crystal form, AcL-RbI formed a unique homotetramer with many substrate sub-binding sites, which likely facilitated capture of the substrate. DATABASE: The atomic coordinates and structure factors of AcL-RbI/l-ribose, AcL-RbI/l-ribulose, AcL-RbI/ribitol, E204Q/l-ribose and E204Q/l-ribulose have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes, 4Q0P, 4Q0Q, 4Q0S, 4Q0U and 4Q0V.
TI  - Biosynthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles by Streptomyces sp. SS2.
AB  - In the present study the microbial biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by secondary metabolites of Streptomyces sp. SS2 in an eco-friendly approach has been reported. The Streptomyces sp. SS2 was isolated from the soil sediment of Similipal Biosphere Reserve. The identification of this strain was determined by phenotypical characteristics (morphological and biochemical) and molecular characterization method using 16 s rDNA sequencing. The morphological study was also done by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. The preliminary characterization of biosynthesized silver nanoparticle was carried out using UV-Vis spectrum analysis, which showed an absorption peak at 420 nm corresponding to plasmon absorption of silver. The average size and charge (zeta potential) of the particles were found to be 67.95 +/- 18.52 nm and -17.7 +/- 5.30 mV, respectively. The functional groups were identified by FTIR studies and their morphology (round and spherical shape) was determined by scanning electron microscopy. The synthesized AgNPs exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (MTCC 1089), Bacillus subtilis (MTCC 7164), Staphylococcus epidermis (MTCC 3615), Vibrio cholerae (MTCC 3904) and Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 1144). These biotechnological approaches of synthesis of nanoparticles can direct a new path in biomaterial sciences and enrich biomedical applications.
TI  - Undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase inhibitors: antibacterial drug leads.
AB  - There is a significant need for new antibiotics due to the rise in drug resistance. Drugs such as methicillin and vancomycin target bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, but methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) have now arisen and are of major concern. Inhibitors acting on new targets in cell wall biosynthesis are thus of particular interest since they might also restore sensitivity to existing drugs, and the cis-prenyl transferase undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPPS), essential for lipid I, lipid II, and thus, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, is one such target. We used 12 UPPS crystal structures to validate virtual screening models and then assayed 100 virtual hits (from 450,000 compounds) against UPPS from S. aureus and Escherichia coli. The most promising inhibitors (IC50 approximately 2 muM, Ki approximately 300 nM) had activity against MRSA, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus anthracis, and a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp. with MIC or IC50 values in the 0.25-4 mug/mL range. Moreover, one compound (1), a rhodanine with close structural similarity to the commercial diabetes drug epalrestat, exhibited good activity as well as a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0.1 with methicillin against the community-acquired MRSA USA300 strain, indicating strong synergism.
TI  - A CAs lyase for degradation of environmental organoarsenical herbicides and animal husbandry growth promoters.
AB  - Arsenic is the most widespread environmental toxin. Substantial amounts of pentavalent organoarsenicals have been used as herbicides, such as monosodium methylarsonic acid (MSMA), and as growth enhancers for animal husbandry, such as roxarsone (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylarsonic acid) [Rox(V)]. These undergo environmental degradation to more toxic inorganic arsenite [As(III)]. We previously demonstrated a two-step pathway of degradation of MSMA to As(III) by microbial communities involving sequential reduction to methylarsonous acid [MAs(III)] by one bacterial species and demethylation from MAs(III) to As(III) by another. In this study, the gene responsible for MAs(III) demethylation was identified from an environmental MAs(III)-demethylating isolate, Bacillus sp. MD1. This gene, termed arsenic inducible gene (arsI), is in an arsenic resistance (ars) operon and encodes a nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenase with C As lyase activity. Heterologous expression of ArsI conferred MAs(III)-demethylating activity and MAs(III) resistance to an arsenic-hypersensitive strain of Escherichia coli, demonstrating that MAs(III) demethylation is a detoxification process. Purified ArsI catalyzes Fe(2+)-dependent MAs(III) demethylation. In addition, ArsI cleaves the C As bond in trivalent roxarsone and other aromatic arsenicals. ArsI homologs are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and we propose that ArsI-catalyzed organoarsenical degradation has a significant impact on the arsenic biogeocycle. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a molecular mechanism for organoarsenic degradation by a C As lyase.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Hibiscus Rosa-sinensis Linn flower extracts.
AB  - Antioxidant and antibacterial potential of different solvent extracts of locally  grown Hibiscus rosa-sinensis Linn was evaluated. The antioxidant activity was assessed by estimation of total flavonoids contents, total phenolic contents, DPPH free radical scavenging activity and percentage inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation capacity. Agar disc diffusion method was used to assess antibacterial potential of crude extract of H. rosa-sinensis. The yield of the crude extracts (23.21 +/- 3.67 and 18.36 +/- 2.98% in 80% methanol and ethanol solvents was calculated, respectively. Methanol and ethanol extract of H. rosa-sinensis showed total phenolics 61.45 +/- 3.23 and 59.31 +/- 4.31 mg/100g as gallic acid equivalent, total flavonoids 53.28 +/- 1.93 and 32.25+/-1.21 mg/100g as catechine equivalent, DPPH free radical scavenging activity 75.46+/-4.67 and 64.98 +/- 2.11% and inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation potential 75.8 +/-3.22 and 61.6 +/- 2.01% respectively, was measured. Antibacterial study against three human pathogens such as staphlococus sp. Bacillus sp. and Escherichia coli showed growth inhibitory effect in the range of 12.75 +/- 1.17 to 16.75 +/- 2.10 mm. These results showed H. rosa-sinensis indigenous to Kallar Kahar and its allied areas bear promising medicinal values and could be used for developing herbal medicines to target oxidative stress and infectious diseases.
TI  - Poultry farm hygiene: microbiological quality assessment of drinking water used in layer chickens managed under the battery cage and deep litter systems at three poultry farms in southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Water troughs from deep litter and caged chicken water troughs (drinkers) fixed to each of the different 3-tier cages containing layer chickens in Farms A, B and C were subjected to a 7-day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. Drinkers were washed before filling with water on Day 1. For Days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. The occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. For the bacterial count on Day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. On Day 5, there was significant difference (p<0.05) among the farms and on Day 7, there was high significant difference (p < 0.01) among the farms. On Days 5 and 7, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. The bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on Day 1, had no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. On Days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p<0.05) and a high significant difference (p < 0.01) between the farms respectively. On Days 5 and 7, no significant differences between the water troughs and between the interaction of the farms and the water troughs. Farm A isolates contained Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermis, Klebsiella sp., Salmonella sp., Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus salivarius and Corynebacterium sp. Farm B had Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium sp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Klebsiella sp. while for Farm C, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in Farms A and B, additional 2 bacterial isolates, Lactobacillus salivarius and Pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. In conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. Those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring.
TI  - A thermo-halo-tolerant and proteinase-resistant endoxylanase from Bacillus sp. HJ14.
AB  - A glycosyl hydrolase family 10 endoxylanase from Bacillus sp. HJ14 was grouped in a separated cluster with another six Bacillus endoxylanases which have not been characterized. These Bacillus endoxylanases showed less than 52% amino acid sequence identity with other endoxylanases and far distance with endoxylanases from most microorganisms. Signal peptide was not detected in the endoxylanase. The endoxylanase was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and the purified recombinant enzyme (rXynAHJ14) was characterized. rXynAHJ14 was apparent optimal at 62.5 degrees C and pH 6.5 and retained more than 55% of the maximum activity when assayed at 40-75 degrees C, 23% at 20 degrees C, 16% at 85 degrees C, and even 8% at 0 degrees C. Half-lives of the enzyme were more than 60 min, approximately 25 and 4 min at 70, 75, and 80 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme exhibited more than 62% xylanase activity and stability at the concentration of 3-30% (w/v) NaCl. No xylanase activity was lost after incubation of the purified rXynAHJ14 with trypsin and proteinase K at 37 degrees C for 60 min. Different components of oligosaccharides were detected in the time-course hydrolysis of beechwood xylan by the enzyme. During the simulated intestinal digestion phase in vitro, 11.5-19.0, 15.3-19.0, 21.9-27.7, and 28.2-31.2 mumol/mL reducing sugar were released by the purified rXynAHJ14 from soybean meal, wheat bran, beechwood xylan, and rapeseed meal, respectively. The endoxylanase might be an alternative for potential applications in the processing of sea food and saline food and in aquaculture as agastric fish feed additive.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial metabolites from an endophytic Aspergillus sp. associated with Melia azedarach.
AB  - Seven known metabolites, dianhydro-aurasperone C (1), isoaurasperone A (2), fonsecinone A (3), asperpyrone A (4), asperazine (5), rubrofusarin B (6) and (R)-3-hydroxybutanonitrile (7), were isolated from the culture of Aspergillus sp. KJ-9, a fungal endophyte isolated from Melia azedarach and identified by spectroscopic methods. All isolates were evaluated in vitro against several phytopathogenic fungi (Gibberella saubinetti, Magnaporthe grisea, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Alternaria solani) and pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphyloccocus aureus and Bacillus cereus). Compounds 3 and 7 were active against almost all phytopathogenic fungi tested with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 6.25-50 muM. Moreover, compound 3 was active against all pathogenic bacteria with MIC in the range of 25-100 muM. Compound 7 is a rare new natural product isolated from a natural source for the first time, and the detailed NMR data of 1 were first assigned.
TI  - Antiparasitic chaiyaphumines from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus sp. PB61.4.
AB  - A new class of four depsipentapeptides called chaiyaphumines A-D (1-4) was isolated from Xenorhabdus sp. PB61.4. Their structures were elucidated by detailed 1D and 2D NMR experiments and by a Marfey's analysis following flash hydrolysis of the peptide. Verification of the structure was achieved by three-dimensional modeling using NOE-derived distance constraints, molecular dynamics, and energy minimization. Chaiyaphumine A (1) showed good activity against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 of 0.61 muM), the causative agent of malaria, and was active against other protozoal tropical disease causing agents.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of the Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria.
AB  - Surface-associated marine bacteria are an interesting source of new secondary metabolites. The aim of this study was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine brown alga, Bifurcaria bifurcata, and the evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bacteria extracts. The identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) extraction. The antioxidant activity of extracts was performed by quantification of total phenolic content (TPC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Antimicrobial activities were evaluated against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. A total of 39 Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria were isolated and 33 were identified as Vibrio sp. (48.72%), Alteromonas sp. (12.82%), Shewanella sp. (12.26%), Serratia sp. (2.56%), Citricoccus sp. (2.56%), Cellulophaga sp. (2.56%), Ruegeria sp. (2.56%) and Staphylococcus sp. (2.56%). Six (15.38%) of the 39 bacteria Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria presented less than a 90% Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) match, and some of those could be new. The highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity (against B. subtilis) was exhibited by strain 16 (Shewanella sp.). Several strains also presented high antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, mainly belonging to Alteromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. There were no positive results against fungi and Gram-negative bacteria. Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria were revealed to be excellent sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Cloning and expression of beta-1, 4-endoglucanase gene from Bacillus subtilis isolated from soil long term irrigated with effluents of paper and pulp mill.
AB  - A strain of Bacillus subtilis IARI-SP-1 isolated from soil long term irrigated with effluents of paper and pulp mill showed high beta-1, 4-endoglucanase (2.5 IU/ml) but low activity of beta-1, 4-exoglucanase (0.8 IU/ml) and beta-glucosidase (0.084 IU/ml). The beta-1, 4-endoglucanase gene of IARI-SP-1 was amplified using degenerate primers designed based on sequences already available in NCBI GenBank. A full length gene of beta-1, 4-endonuclease consisting of 1499 nucleotides was identified through sequence analysis of the amplified product. The ORF encoded for a protein of 500 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 55 kDa. The gene was cloned in pET-28a and over expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). In comparison to wild strain (B. subtilis), the transformed E. coli exhibited four times increase in cellulase production. Higher enzyme activity was observed in supernatant (8.2 IU/ml) than cell pellet (2.8 IU/ml) suggesting more extracellular production of beta-1, 4-endoglucanase. SDS-PAGE and CMC plate assay also confirmed the overproduction by the transformed E. coli. The pH and temperature optima of expressed beta-1, 4-endoglucanase enzyme was identical to that of wild strain and was 8 and 50-60 degrees C, respectively.
TI  - Genomics-guided discovery of endophenazines from Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714.
AB  - In this study we report on the genomics-guided exploration of the metabolic potential of the newly discovered strain Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714. The bioinformatics analysis of the whole genome sequence revealed the presence of a biosynthetic gene cluster presumably responsible for the biosynthesis of formerly unknown endophenazine derivatives. A 200 L cultivation combined with bioactivity-guided isolation techniques revealed four new natural products belonging to the endophenazines and the 5,10-dihydrophenazines. Detailed descriptions of their biological effects, mainly focused on antimicrobial properties against several mycobacteria, are given.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of a novel mesophilic alkaline protease from Bacillus sp. L010 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria producing proteases were isolated and selected from the environment and the alkaline proteases with superior performance for commercial exploitation were screened. METHODS: The strain producing extracellular proteases was isolated by a casein plate and was identified by biochemical and morphological tests and by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. To acquire the open reading frame (ORF) of the protease, degenerate primers designing and genome walking method were used. The precursor and mature peptide of the protease were recombinant expressed in BL21 (DE3). After purification of the active protease, the characteristics and the catalytic ability were detected using synthetic peptide succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide as the substrates. RESULTS: Strain L010 isolated was named as Bacillus sp. L010 after identification. The ORF of the protease was 1149-bp long and encoded a protein of 382 amino acids comprised with a 30-residual signal peptide, a 77-residual propeptide, and a 275-residual mature protein, and the encoded protein was one of subtilisins-a member of serine proteases and designated as SprD. The precursor of SprD (pro-SprD) autoprocessed into active SprD mediated by the propeptide when pro-SprD was recombinant expressed in BL21 (DE3). The enzyme exhibited high catalytic efficiency (K(cat)/K(m)) towards synthesis substrates with optimal activity at 70 degrees C and pH 9 - 10. SprD was stable over a range of pH 7.0 to 10.0 and was thermal stable at 25 degrees C - 60 degrees C. CONCLUSION: The high stability of SprD towards alkaline conditions (pH 7 - 10) and under temperature 25 degrees C - 60 degrees C and the high catalytic efficiency suggested that the protease would find research value and potential applications.
TI  - Campechic acids A and B: anti-invasive polyether polyketides from a soil-derived  Streptomyces.
AB  - Campechic acids A (1) and B (2), two new polyketides, were isolated from the culture extract of Streptomyces sp., and their structures were determined by NMR and MS spectroscopic analysis. Campechic acids are polyether-polyketides functionalized by two tetrahydrofuran rings, an enolized 1,3-diketone, and multiple methyl substitutions. Absolute configuration of nine stereogenic centers in 1, except for four chiral centers in the cyclic ether moieties, was determined by the 1H NMR anisotropy method in combination with chemical degradation. Campechic acids exhibited potent inhibitory effects on tumor cell invasion with IC50 values in the nanomolar to submicromolar range.
TI  - Modification of Fatty acids in membranes of bacteria: implication for an adaptive mechanism to the toxicity of carbon nanotubes.
AB  - We explored whether bacteria could respond adaptively to the presence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by investigating the influence of CNTs on the viability, composition of fatty acids, and cytoplasmic membrane fluidity of bacteria in aqueous medium for 24 h exposure. The CNTs included long single-walled carbon nanotubes (L-SWCNTs), short single-walled carbon nanotubes (S-SWCNTs), short carboxyl single-walled carbon nanotubes (S-SWCNT-COOH), and aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (A-MWCNTs). The bacteria included three common model bacteria, Staphyloccocus aureus (Gram-positive), Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive), and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative), and one polybrominated diphenyl ether degrading strain, Ochrobactrum sp. (Gram-negative). Generally, L-SWCNTs were the most toxic to bacteria, whereas S-SWCNT-COOH showed the mildest bacterial toxicity. Ochrobactrum sp. was more susceptible to the toxic effect of CNTs than E. coli. Compared to the control in the absence of CNTs, the viability of Ochrobactrum sp. decreased from 71.6-81.4% to 41.8-70.2%, and E. coli from 93.7-104.0% to 67.7-91.0% when CNT concentration increased from 10 to 50 mg L(-1). The cytoplasmic membrane fluidity of bacteria increased with CNT concentration, and a significant negative correlation existed between the bacterial viabilities and membrane fluidity for E. coli and Ochrobactrum sp. (p < 0.05), indicating that the increase in membrane fluidity induced by CNTs was an important factor causing the inactivation of bacteria. In the presence of CNTs, E. coli and Ochrobactrum sp. showed elevation in the level of saturated fatty acids accompanied with reduction in unsaturated fatty acids, compensating for the fluidizing effect of CNTs. This demonstrated that bacteria could modify their composition of fatty acids to adapt to the toxicity of CNTs. In contrast, S. aureus and B. subtilis exposed to CNTs increased the proportion of branched-chain fatty acids and decreased the level of straight-chain fatty acids, which was also favorable to counteract the toxic effect of CNTs. This study suggests that the bacterial tolerances to CNTs are associated with both the adaptive modification of fatty acids in the membrane and the physicochemical properties of CNTs. This is the first report about the physiologically adaptive response of bacteria to CNTs, and may help to further understand the ecotoxicological effects of CNTs.
TI  - Heronamides D-F, polyketide macrolactams from the deep-sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032.
AB  - Three new macrolactams, heronamides D-F (1-3), were isolated from the deep-sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032 upon changing cultivation conditions. The planar structures of heronamides D-F (1-3) were elucidated by extensive MS and NMR spectroscopic analyses and comparisons with the closely related heronamides A-C. The relative configurations of 1-3 were deduced by detailed analysis of (3)JHH values and NOESY data. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were determined by chemical modifications and application of the modified Mosher's method. None of the compounds exhibited obvious antimicrobial or cytotoxic activities.
TI  - Structural properties of prokaryotic promoter regions correlate with functional features.
AB  - The structural properties of the DNA molecule are known to play a critical role in transcription. In this paper, the structural profiles of promoter regions were studied within the context of their diversity and their function for eleven prokaryotic species; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhimurium, Pseudomonas auroginosa, Geobacter sulfurreducens Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Synechocystis sp., Synechoccocus elongates, Bacillus anthracis, and the archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus. The main anchor point for these promoter regions were transcription start sites identified through high-throughput experiments or collected within large curated databases. Prokaryotic promoter regions were found to be less stable and less flexible than the genomic mean across all studied species. However, direct comparison between species revealed differences in their structural profiles that can not solely be explained by the difference in genomic GC content. In addition, comparison with functional data revealed that there are patterns in the promoter structural profiles that can be linked to specific functional loci, such as sigma factor regulation or transcription factor binding. Interestingly, a novel structural element clearly visible near the transcription start site was found in genes associated with essential cellular functions and growth in several species. Our analyses reveals the great diversity in promoter structural profiles both between and within prokaryotic species. We observed relationships between structural diversity and functional features that are interesting prospects for further research to yet uncharacterized functional loci defined by DNA structural properties.
TI  - Multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay for detection of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella sp., Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in spiked shrimps (Penaeus monodon).
AB  - The coastal aquaculture mainly shrimps constitute major export sector in Bangladesh and is increasingly shaped by international trade conditions and by national responses to those stringent quality and safety standards. PCR based validated methods for detection of major bacterial pathogens in shrimp might be very useful tool for ensuring quality and safety standards of exportable shrimps. The objective of this study was to evaluate overall performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the multiplex PCR assay for detection of Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7 from spiked shrimp samples. The targeted genes were ompW for V. cholerae, tdh for V. parahaemolyticus, sefA for Salmonella spp. and hlyEHEC for E. coli O157:H7. The genomic DNA was extracted by using standard method and amplified accordingly. Sensitivity of the assay was tested by inoculating the shrimp homogenate with viable cells of laboratory references strains (target pathogens). The genes were amplified individually both from culture homogenate and spiked samples. Twenty different uniplex and multiplex PCR assay were performed; the results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of multiplex PCR are comparable to that of the results of uniplex PCR for the samples. DNA extracted from shrimp samples spiked with non-target pathogen (Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri and Staphylococcus aureus) yielded negative results.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of 3,3'-phenylmethylene-bis-4-hydroxycoumarins:  selective and potent inhibitors of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Dicoumarols and coumarin derivatives have shown a variety of pharmaceutical activities and have been found to be potent inhibitor for the NAD(P)H-dependent flavoproteins. In this report, dicoumarol and its derivatives containing the substituted benzene ring at the methylenebis position were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. The results showed that the synthesized dicoumarols affect cell growth but are selective against gram-positive over gram-negative bacterial cells. However, for most derivatives, the substitution of steric bulky benzene group on the methylenebis position appears to decrease in the efficacy of antibacterial effect. This finding is roughly described by the predicted poorer docked structure of the derivatives to a homology model of S. aureus flavoprotein. 3D-QSAR study highlighted structural features around the substituted benzene ring of dicoumarols as the antibacterial activity. CoMFA and CoMSIA contour maps support the idea that steric repulsion at the para position could diminish the antibacterial activity. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the molecular basis for the antibacterial activity of dicoumarols.
TI  - Potentialities of newly isolated Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
AB  - Two Bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16S rRNA sequence profile as Bacillus subtilis AKL1 and by biochemical process as Lactobacillus acidophilus AKL2. These isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. Different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (Mother Dairy and Thackar) curds. The total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of AKL1 and AKL2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). The antioxidant activity against ABTS+, DPPH8, OH* and Fe3+ were also higher in the newly formulated curd. Polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in AKL1+AKL2. All these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by SDS-PAGE. The curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentery, Vibrio cholerae and Staphylococcus aureus. It can be concluded that the combination of these Lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.
TI  - Efficicent (R)-phenylethanol production with enantioselectivity-alerted (S)-carbonyl reductase II and NADPH regeneration.
AB  - The NADPH-dependent (S)-carbonyl reductaseII from Candida parapsilosis catalyzes  acetophenone to chiral phenylethanol in a very low yield of 3.2%. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to design two mutants Ala220Asp and Glu228Ser, inside or adjacent to the substrate-binding pocket. Both mutations caused a significant enantioselectivity shift toward (R)-phenylethanol in the reduction of acetophenone. The variant E228S produced (R)-phenylethanol with an optical purity above 99%, in 80.2% yield. The E228S mutation resulted in a 4.6-fold decrease in the K M value, but nearly 5-fold and 21-fold increases in the k cat and k cat/K M values with respect to the wild type. For NADPH regeneration, Bacillus sp. YX-1 glucose dehydrogenase was introduced into the (R)-phenylethanol pathway. A coexpression system containing E228S and glucose dehydrogenase was constructed. The system was optimized by altering the coding gene order on the plasmid and using the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the aligned spacing sequence as a linker between them. The presence of glucose dehydrogenase increased the NADPH concentration slightly and decreased NADP(+) pool 2- to 4-fold; the NADPH/NADP(+) ratio was improved 2- to 5-fold. The recombinant Escherichia coli/pET-MS-SD-AS-G, with E228S located upstream and glucose dehydrogenase downstream, showed excellent performance, giving (R)-phenylethanol of an optical purity of 99.5 % in 92.2% yield in 12 h in the absence of an external cofactor. When 0.06 mM NADP(+) was added at the beginning of the reaction, the reaction duration was reduced to 1 h. Optimization of the coexpression system stimulated an over 30-fold increase in the yield of (R)-phenylethanol, and simultaneously reduced the reaction time 48-fold compared with the wild-type enzyme. This report describes possible mechanisms for alteration of the enantiopreferences of carbonyl reductases by site mutation, and cofactor rebalancing pathways for efficient chiral alcohols production.
TI  - A one-pot system for production of L-2-aminobutyric acid from L-threonine by L-threonine deaminase and a NADH-regeneration system based on L-leucine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase.
AB  - L-2-Aminobutyric acid (L-ABA) is an unnatural amino acid that is a key intermediate for the synthesis of several important drugs. It can be produced by transaminase or dehydrogenase from alpha-ketobutyric acid, which can be synthesized enzymatically from the bulk amino acid, L-threonine. Deamination of L-threonine followed by a hydrogenation reaction gave almost the theoretical yield and was estimated to be more cost-effective than the established chemical process. L-Threonine deaminase from Escherichia coli, L-leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus cereus, and formate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas sp. were over-expressed in E. coli and used for one-pot production of L-ABA with formate as a co-substrate for NADH regeneration. 30 mol L-threonine were converted to 29.2 mol L-ABA at 97.3 % of theoretical yield and with productivity of 6.37 g l(-1) h(-1) at 50 l. This process offers a promising approach to fulfil industrial requirements for L-ABA.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of some Euphorbia species.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts and latex of some Euphorbia species used for medical purposes in Turkey were investigated. The extracts of Euphorbia aleppica L., Euphorbia szovitsii Fisch.&Mey. var. harputensis Aznav. ex M. S. Khan, Euphorbia falcata L. sub. falcata var. falcata, Euphorbia denticulata Lam., Euphorbia macroclada Boiss., Euphorbia cheiradenia Boiss.&Hohen, Euphorbia virgata Waldst.&Kit., Euphorbia petiolata Banks&Sol. were prepared with methanol. The antimicrobial activities of these extracts were examined on test microorganisms as follows: Staphylococcus aureus COWAN 1, Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Proteus vulgaris FMC 1, Klebsiella pneumonia FMC 5, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 50071, Candida albicans FMC 17, Candida glabrata ATCC 66032, Epidermophyton sp. and Trichophyton sp. by the disc diffusion methods and well agar method. The MIC values of extracts were determined according to the broth microdulitions method. Results indicated that extracts of Euphorbia species inhibited the growth of tested microorganisms in the different ratio. Also, the MIC values of extracts were determined as 31,2-1000 microg.
TI  - Molecular Cloning and Nucleotide Sequence of the Gene for an Alkaline Protease from Bacillus circulans MTCC 7906.
AB  - Bacillus circulans MTCC 7906, an extracellular alkaline protease producer was genetically characterized. B. circulans genomic DNA was isolated, oligonucleotide primers specific to alkaline protease gene of B. circulans were designed and its PCR amplification was done. The purified PCR product and pTrcHisA vector were subjected to restriction digestion with NcoI and HindIII and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5-alpha competent cells. The recombinant expression of alkaline protease gene studied by inducible expression and analysis by SDS-PAGE, established that the alkaline protease protein had an estimated molecular size of 46 kDa. Gene sequencing of the insert from selected recombinant clone showed it to be a 1329 bp gene encoding a protein of 442 amino acids. The sequence was blasted and aligned with known alkaline protease genes for comparison with their nucleotide and amino acid sequences. This identified major matches with three closely related subsp. of B. subtilis (B. subtilis subsp. subtilis strain 168, B. subtilis BSn5 and B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii strain W23). The insert also showed a number of substitutions (mutations) with other sp. of Bacillus which established that alkaline protease of B. circulans MTCC 7906 is a novel gene. The phylogenetic analysis of alkaline protease gene and its predicted amino acid sequences also validated that alkaline protease gene is a novel gene and the same has been accessioned in GenBank with accession number JN645176.1.
TI  - Recombinant production and characterization of full-length and truncated beta-1,3-glucanase PglA from Paenibacillus sp. S09.
AB  - BACKGROUND: beta-1,3-Glucanases catalyze the hydrolysis of glucan polymers containing beta-1,3-linkages. These enzymes are of great biotechnological, agricultural and industrial interest. The applications of beta-1,3-glucanases is well established in fungal disease biocontrol, yeast extract production and wine extract clarification. Thus, the identification and characterization of novel beta-1,3-glucanases with high catalytic efficiency and stability is of particular interest. RESULTS: A beta-1,3-glucanase gene designated PglA was cloned from a newly isolated strain Paenibacillus sp. S09. The gene PglA contained a 2631-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 876 amino acids which shows 76% identity with the beta-1,3-glucanase (BglH) from Bacillus circulans IAM1165. The encoded protein PglA is composed of a signal peptide, an N-terminal leader region, a glycoside hydrolase family 16 (GH16) catalytic domain and a C-terminal immunoglobulin like (Ig-like) domain. The Escherichia coli expression system of PglA and five truncated derivatives containing one or two modules was constructed to investigate the role of catalytic and non-catalytic modules. The pH for optimal activity of the enzymes was slightly affected (pH 5.5-6.5) by the presence of different modules. However, the temperature for optimal activity was strongly influenced by the C-terminal domain and ranged from 50 to 60 degrees C. Deletion of C-terminal domain resulted in obviously enhancing enzymatic thermostability. Specific activity assay indicated that PglA specifically hydrolyzes beta-1,3-glucan. Insoluble beta-1,3-glucan binding and hydrolysis were boosted by the presence of N-and C-terminal domains. Kinetic analysis showed that the presence of N-and C-terminus enhances the substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency of the catalytic domain toward laminarin. Carbohydrate-binding assay directly confirmed the binding capabilities of the N-and C-terminal domains. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insight into the impacts of non-catalytic modules on enzymatic properties of beta-1,3-glucanase. Activity comparison of full-length PglA and truncated forms revealed the negative effect of C-terminal region on thermal stability of the enzyme. Both the N-and C-terminal domains exerted strong binding activity toward insoluble beta-1,3-glucan, and could be classified into CBM families.
TI  - Exopolymers from Tolypothrix tenuis and three Anabaena sp. (Cyanobacteriaceae) as novel blood clotting agents for wound management.
AB  - Rapid initiation of clotting is critical to trauma patients. In the present study exopolymers (EPs) from four desert cyanobacteria including Tolypothrix tenuis and three species of Anabaena have been discovered as potential hemostatic biomaterials. The EPs showed reduction in activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) by 16-41% and 12-65%, respectively. Besides hastening blood clotting, the EPs could absorb 7.1-25.9 g H(2)O g(-1) EP and displayed 7.1-18.1% hydrophobicity. They were noncytotoxic and biodegradable. The EP from Anabaena sp. showed strong antibacterial activity against E. coli, S. aureus and B. licheniformis. These results suggest that cyanobacteria, the microscopic phototrophs growing rapidly over simple mineral medium could prove to be a novel source of affordable hemostatic dressings for the traumatic wounds in underdeveloped and developing countries. Compositional analysis of the EPs showed them to be consisting of mainly carbohydrate (17-50%), protein (4.4-7.2%), uronic acid (4.7-9.5%) and sulphate (0.6-6.6%). Their viscometric molecular weight ranged from 539 to 3679 kDa. They were further characterized using GC-MS and FTIR.
TI  - Isolation and identification of a new intracellular antimicrobial peptide produced by Paenibacillus alvei AN5.
AB  - A wild-type, Gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming and motile bacteria has been isolated from palm oil mill sludge in Malaysia. Molecular identification using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the bacteria belonged to genus Paenibacillus. With 97 % similarity to P. alvei (AUG6), the isolate was designated as P. alvei AN5. An antimicrobial compound was extracted from P. alvei AN5-pelleted cells using 95 % methanol and was then lyophilized. Precipitates were re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), producing an antimicrobial crude extract (ACE). The ACE showed antimicrobial activity against Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Escherichia coli ATCC 29522, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 and Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014. By using SP-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography, Sephadex G-25 gel filtration and Tricine SDS-PAGE, the ACE was purified, which produced a ~2-kDa active band. SDS-PAGE and infrared (IR) spectroscopy indicated the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound in the ACE, and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy and de novo sequencing using an automatic, Q-TOF premier system detected a peptide with the amino acid sequence F-C-K-S-L-P-L-P-L-S-V-K (1,330.7789 Da). This novel peptide was designated as AN5-2. The antimicrobial peptide exhibited stability from pH 3 to 12 and maintained its activity after being heated to 90 degrees C. It also remained active after incubation with denaturants (urea, SDS and EDTA).
TI  - Paraben resistance in bacteria from sewage treatment plant effluents in India.
AB  - Parabens, the antimicrobial preservatives used in cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals, are often detected in the aquatic environment. Generally, sewage treatment plants (STPs) receive community sewage containing parabens, which are ultimately released into streams/rivers. In this study, bacteria in STP effluents were evaluated for their resistance to parabens. The susceptibility was in the order of Staphylococcus aureus > Bacillus sp. >Escherichia coli > Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram-negative bacteria showed less susceptibility than their control and Gram-positive bacteria. Further, the bacteria were more sensitive towards butyl and ethyl parabens. Interestingly, the strains showed resistance to >/=5 mg of parabens, which is equivalent to or higher than reported environmental concentrations. The increase in paraben chain length did not enhance the susceptibility in all cases and it was understood that the activity may differ for each bacterium in the environment. This is the first profile on paraben resistance in common pathogens of Indian STPs. Paraben resistance may be developed due to continuous exposure even at sub-inhibitory and/or chronic levels in the environment and this resistance may be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria in receiving waters. Thus the study demonstrates the effectiveness of the disc diffusion method in environmental bacterial resistance assessment and addresses the risk involved in the use of parabens.
TI  - Function of arsATorf7orf8 of Bacillus sp. CDB3 in arsenic resistance.
AB  - Bacillus sp. CDB3 isolated from an arsenic contaminated cattle dip site possesses an uncommon arsenic resistance (ars) operon bearing eight genes in the order of arsRYCDATorf7orf8. We investigated the functions of arsA, arsT, orf7 and orf8 in arsenic resistance using a plasmid-based gene knockout approach in the ars gene deficient Escherichia coli strain AW3110. The CDB3 arsA gene was shown to play a significant role in resistance, suggesting that the encoded ArsA may couple with the arsenite transporter, forming an ArsAY complex that can enhance arsenite extrusion efficiency. The disruption of either arsTor orf7 was not observed to affect arsenic resistance in the heterologous E. coli host, but their involvement in arsenic resistance can not be excluded. The orf8 gene is predicted to encode a putative dual-specificity protein phosphatase which also shares certain homology to arsenate reductases. The function loss of orf8 resulted in a remarkable decrease in resistance to arsenate, though not arsenite. To examine if this effect was due to the reduction of arsenate by orf8, the arsC gene within the 8-gene operon was disrupted. The resulting abolishment of arsenate resistance suggests that the involvement of orf8 in arsenic resistance is not via reductase activity.
TI  - Pimarane diterpenes from the Arctic fungus Eutypella sp. D-1.
AB  - Two new diterpenes, libertellenone G(1) and libertellenone H(2) were isolated from the fungus Eutypella sp. D-1 isolated from the soil of high latitude of Arctic, together with two known pimarane diterpenes (3-4). The structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated from spectroscopic data (nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and infrared). These compounds were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against seven human tumor cell lines. Compound 2 showed a range of cytotoxicity between 3.31 and 44.1 muM. Compound 1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - D-xylose detection in Escherichia coli by a xylose binding protein-dependent response.
AB  - A gene circuit for the controlled expression of a marker gene and for the assay of xylose concentration in Escherichia coli has been designed and tested. The xylF coding sequence for the xylose binding protein (XBP) was cloned in pT7T318U downstream from the promoter for xylanase A from B. subtilis (Pbsu), together with the GFP coding sequence (gfp) under the control of the xylF promoter, forming the pT7T3-GFP-XBP construct. GFP fluorescence in Escherichia coli JW3538-1 xylF-transformed with pT7T3-GFP-XBP was approximately 1.4 x higher after 520 min growth in the presence of 5mM xylose than in cells transformed with pT7T3-GFP. Under saturating xylose concentration, flow cytometry analysis showed that all cells resulted in homogeneous populations, and the population with XBP showed a fluorescence greater than that without XBP. Activity of the xylF promoter in cells transformed with pT7T3-GFP-XBP was approximately 40% higher than with the pT7T3-GFP. No response was observed with arabinose and ribose, showing that the expression effects were specific for xylose, demonstrating the potential use of the gene circuit as a biosensor.
TI  - Chemical constituents of Aspergillus sp EJC08 isolated as endophyte from Bauhinia guianensis and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The present work reports the isolation of five compounds from Aspergillus sp EJC08 isolated as endophytic from Bauhinia guianensis, a tipical plant of the Amazon. The compounds ergosterol (1), ergosterol peroxide (2), mevalolactone (3), monomethylsulochrin (4) and trypacidin A (5) were isolated by chromatographic procedures and identified by spectral methods of 1D and 2D NMR and MS. Compounds 3, 4 and 5 were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and showed good activity.
TI  - Nonomuraea sp. ID06-A0189 inulin fructotransferase (DFA III-forming): gene cloning, characterization and conservation among other Nonomuraea species.
AB  - The inulin fructotransferase (DFA III-forming)(EC 4.2.2.18) gene in Nonomuraea sp. ID06-A0189 was amplified from genomic DNA, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The 1326-bp gene, designated as Nsp-ift, encodes a protein composed of a putative 37-amino-acid signal peptide and 404-amino-acid mature protein. A putative ribosomal binding sequence was identified 12 bases upstream from the start codon. However, a typical bacterial promoter could not be found by in silico analysis. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the enzyme was most similar to that of inulin fructotransferase (DFA I-forming) in Frankia sp. EAN1pec. Phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino-acid sequences indicated that Nonomuraea sp. ID06-A0189 and Frankia sp. EAN1pec inulin fructotransferases formed a distinct clade from those from Arthrobacter sp. H65-7, A. globiformis and Bacillus sp. snu-7 that showed 57, 56 and 56% identity to that of Nsp-ift, respectively. The Nsp-ift without a putative signal peptide was successfully expressed in E. coli and partially purified using His-tag affinity chromatography. The recombinant enzyme displayed optimum temperature between 65 and 70 degrees C, optimum pH between 5.5 and 6.0 and remained stable up to 70 degrees C. The properties were identical to those of the original enzyme. Of 10 Nonomuraea species tested by Southern hybridization, enzyme activity measurements and PCR, only Nonomuraea sp. ID06-A0189 has the Nsp-ift gene, suggesting that Nsp-ift is not highly conserved in this genus.
TI  - Bacteriology of a most popular street food (Panipuri) and inhibitory effect of essential oils on bacterial growth.
AB  - Bacteriology of Panipuri was studied and the antibacterial effect of eight essential oils (EOs) was established on pathogens found in Panipuri. Samples were collected from twelve respective vendors from different locations in Baripada city, Orissa. Samples were fractionated into two parts viz. khatta pani and smashed potato masala used in Panipuri. Total plate count and isolation of pathogenic bacteria were done on both basal and selective media. Coliforms were detected primarily by presumptive test and confirmed subsequently, using Eosine Methylene Blue Agar. Selected colonies were pure cultured and identified through staining and an array of biochemical reactions. Antibiogram pattern of the pathogens and their susceptibility towards eight different EOs were performed. Antibacterial efficacy of four EOs in food sample was studied. Aerobic bacterial load of solid samples was observed to be more than in the liquid samples. Coliform-positive samples were found to be of 80.33%. Pathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobactor sp., Bacillus sp., Enterococcus sp., Micrococcus tetragens, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella dysenteriae and Vibrio sp. were detected. Antibiogram studies of the isolates showed multiple antibiotic resistance index (MRI;%) ranging from 15 to 92%. Among the EOs studied Cinnamon and Clove oils showed maximum antibacterial activity. Antibacterial efficacy showed that Clove and Cinnamon oils were comparatively of superior quality than Turmeric leaf and Japanese mint oils to kill food borne pathogens. Although it was a preliminary endeavor, the present study is a prerequisite in understanding the significance of pathogenic microorganisms in street foods and use of EOs as both antibacterial agents and food preservatives.
TI  - [Expression optimization and characterization of Tenebrio molitor antimicrobiol peptides TmAMP1m in Escherichia coli].
AB  - To improve the expression level of tmAMP1m gene from Tenebrio molitor in Escherichia coli, we studied the effects of expression level and activity of the fusion protein HIS-TmAMP1m by conditions, such as culture temperature, inducing time and the final concentration of inductor Isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). We analyzed the optimum expression conditions by Tricine-SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, meanwhile, detected its antibacterial activity by using agarose cavity diffusion method. The results suggest that when inducing the recombinant plasmid with a final IPTG concentration of 0.1 mmol/L at 37 degrees C for 4 h, there was the highest expression level of fusion protein HIS-TmAMP1m in Escherichia coli. Under these conditions, the expression of fusion protein accounted for 40% of the total cell lysate with the best antibacterial activity. We purified the fusion protein HIS-TmAMPlm with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal-affinity chromatography matrices. Western blotting analysis indicates that the His monoclonal antibody could be specifically bound to fusion protein HIS-TmAMPlm. After expression by inducing, the fusion protein could inhibit the growth of host cell transformed by pET30a-tmAMP1m. The fusion protein HIS-TmAMP1m had better stability and remained higher antibacterial activities when incubated at 100 degrees C for 10 h, repeated freeze thawing at -20 degrees C, dissolved in strong acid and alkali, or treated by organic solvents and protease. Moreover, the minimum inhibitory concentration results demonstrated that the fusion protein HIS-TmAMP1m has a good antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus sp., Corynebacterium glutamicum, Bacillus thuringiensis, Corynebacterium sp. This study laid the foundation to promote the application of insect antimicrobial peptides and further research.
TI  - Surface display of recombinant proteins on Escherichia coli by BclA exosporium of Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The anchoring motif is one of the most important aspects of cell surface display as well as efficient and stable display of target proteins. Thus, there is currently a need for the identification and isolation of novel anchoring motifs. RESULTS: A system for the display of recombinant proteins on the surface of Escherichia coli was developed using the Bacillus anthracis exosporal protein (BclA) as a new anchoring motif. For the surface display of recombinant proteins, the BAN display platform was constructed in which a target protein is linked to the C-terminus of N-terminal domain (21 amino acids) of BclA. The potential application of BAN platform for cell surface display was demonstrated with two model proteins of different size, the Bacillus sp. endoxylanase (XynA) and monooxygenase (P450 BM3m2). Through experimental analysis including outer membrane fractionation, confocal microscopy and activity assay, it was clearly confirmed that both model proteins were successfully displayed with high activities on the E. coli cell surface. CONCLUSIONS: These results of this study suggest that the strategy employing the B. anthracis BclA as an anchoring motif is suitable for the display of heterologous proteins on the surface of E. coli and consequently for various biocatalytic applications as well as protein engineering.
TI  - [Gene cloning and characterization of a solvent-resistant glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus sp. YX-1].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A gene encoding solvent-resistant glucose dehydrogenase was cloned from Bacillus sp. YX-1 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was then characterized. METHODS: The glucose dehydrogenase gene was amplified from Bacillus sp. YX-1 genome according to its conserved sequences in Bacillus sp. The recombinant enzyme was over-expressed in E. coli and purified by HisTrap HP affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme were characterized. RESULTS: The glucose dehydrogenase gene contains an open reading frame of 786 bp encoding 261 amino acids. The maximum activity was observed at 45 degrees C and pH 8.0. The recombinant enzyme was highly resistant to several organic solvents. More than 90% of the activity was maintained when the enzyme was incubated in 50% cyclohexane, octane, decane at home temperature for 1 h. In addition, the enzyme displayed broad substrate spectrum and has catalytic activity for several sugars to afford reduced coenzymes. It exhibits similar capability to regenerate either NADH or NADPH with specific activity of 8.37 U/mg and 8.62 U/mg for NAD+ and NADP+. CONCLUSION: The organic solvent-tolerant glucose dehydrogenase was explored successfully on the basis of bioinformatics analysis. The work supplied a new biocatalyst for the cofactor-regeneration during the reaction in organic phases catalyzed by oxidoreductases.
TI  - A thermophilic alkalophilic alpha-amylase from Bacillus sp. AAH-31 shows a novel  domain organization among glycoside hydrolase family 13 enzymes.
AB  - alpha-Amylases (EC 3.2.1.1) hydrolyze internal alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkages of starch and related glucans. Bacillus sp. AAH-31 produces an alkalophilic thermophilic alpha-amylase (AmyL) of higher molecular mass, 91 kDa, than typical bacterial alpha-amylases. In this study, the AmyL gene was cloned to determine its primary structure, and the recombinant enzyme, produced in Escherichia coli, was characterized. AmyL shows no hydrolytic activity towards pullulan, but the central region of AmyL (Gly395-Asp684) was similar to neopullulanase-like alpha-amylases. In contrast to known neopullulanase-like alpha-amylases, the N-terminal region (Gln29-Phe102) of AmyL was similar to carbohydrate-binding module family 20 (CBM20), which is involved in the binding of enzymes to starch granules. Recombinant AmyL showed more than 95% of its maximum activity in a pH range of 8.2-10.5, and was stable below 65 degrees C and from pH 6.4 to 11.9. The kcat values for soluble starch, gamma-cyclodextrin, and maltotriose were 103 s(-1), 67.6 s(-1), and 5.33 s(-1), respectively, and the Km values were 0.100 mg/mL, 0.348 mM, and 2.06 mM, respectively. Recombinant AmyL did not bind to starch granules. But the substitution of Trp45 and Trp84, conserved in site 1 of CBM20, with Ala reduced affinity to soluble starch, while the mutations did not affect affinity for oligosaccharides. Substitution of Trp61, conserved in site 2 of CBM20, with Ala enhanced hydrolytic activity towards soluble starch, indicating that site 2 of AmyL does not contribute to binding to soluble long-chain substrates.
TI  - Disinfection protocols to prevent cross-contamination between dental offices and  prosthetic laboratories.
AB  - Control of cross-contamination between dental offices and prosthetic laboratories is of utmost importance to maintain the health of patients and dental office staff. The purpose of this study was to evaluate disinfection protocols, considering antimicrobial effectiveness and damage to the structures of prostheses. Solutions of 1% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate, 50% vinegar and sodium perborate were evaluated. Specimens were contaminated in vitro with standardized suspensions of Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis spores. Disinfection by immersion for 10 min was performed. Final counts of microorganisms were obtained using the plating method. Results were statistically compared by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Dunn's test. The surface roughness of 40 specimens was analyzed before and after 10 disinfection cycles, and results were compared statistically using Student's t test. The solution of 50% vinegar was as effective as 1% sodium hypochlorite and 2% chlorhexidine against C. albicans, E. coli and S. mutans. The sodium perborate solution showed the lowest antimicrobial effectiveness. Superficial roughness increased after cycles in 1% sodium hypochlorite (p=0.02). Solutions of 1% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine and 50% vinegar were effective for the disinfection of heat-polymerized acrylic specimens. Sodium hypochlorite increased the superficial roughness.
TI  - Bacillus amyloliquefaciens laccase--from soil bacteria to recombinant enzyme for  wastewater decolorization.
AB  - One hundred wild type strains of Bacillus sp. were isolated from industrial and agricultural soil across Serbia and screened for laccase activity. Three strains showed high laccase activity temperature optimum of 65 and 80 degrees C towards ABTS. A new laccase gene from the strain with highest temperature optimum, namely Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 12B was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant laccase degraded dye Reactive blue 52 at pH 7.0 and pH 4.0 and at elevated temperature, while fungal laccases was unable to act on this substrate at pH higher than 4.0 and was quickly inactivated at temperatures higher than 45 degrees C. Degradation of dye was monitored by HPLC-DAD and resulting precipitate was analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy. Single product peak without chromophore was detected in solution, while water insoluble aggregate, presumably dye polymer is formed retaining blue color.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated Bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The cell free culture filtrate of Bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (CDPs): cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp), cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val), cyclo(D-Pro-D-Met), and cyclo(D-Pro-D-Phe), respectively. Compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) except cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val). Cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val) recorded activity only against Gram positive bacteria. Best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against S. aureus (4 mug/ml). The four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin B, the standard fungicide. The highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) was recorded against T. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The activity of cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against T. rubrum, C. neoformans and C. albicans were better than amphotericin B, the standard antifungal agent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of CDPs against the human pathogenic fungi T. rubrum and C. neoformans. The four CDPs are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. We conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - The diversity and antimicrobial activity of Preussia sp. endophytes isolated from Australian dry rainforests.
AB  - Limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of Preussia within Australia. This report describes endophytic Preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. Screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of ATCC type strains which included Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the opportunist yeast pathogen Candida albicans. Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive EtOAc extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. A total of 18 Preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in Genbank, suggesting that they are new species. In preliminary screening, 13/18 Preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against MRSA and C. albicans. These results highlight the antimicrobial potential of Australian Preussia spp. and also the importance of Australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.
TI  - Bioanalysis for biocatalysis: multiplexed capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry assay for aminotransferase substrate discovery and specificity profiling.
AB  - In this work, we introduce an entirely automated enzyme assay based on capillary  electrophoresis coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry termed MINISEP-MS for multiple interfluent nanoinjections-incubation-separation-enzyme profiling using mass spectrometry. MINISEP-MS requires only nanoliters of reagent solutions and uses the separation capillary as a microreactor, allowing multiple substrates to be assayed simultaneously. The method can be used to rapidly profile the substrate specificity of any enzyme and to measure steady-state kinetics in an automated fashion. We used the MINISEP-MS assay to profile the substrate specificity of three aminotransferases (E. coli aspartate aminotransferase, E. coli branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, and Bacillus sp. YM-1 D-amino acid aminotransferase) for 33 potential amino acid substrates and to measure steady-state kinetics. Using MINISEP-MS, we were able to recapitulate the known substrate specificities and to discover new amino acid substrates for these industrially relevant enzymes. Additionally, we were able to measure the apparent K(M) and k(cat) parameters for amino acid donor substrates of these aminotransferases. Because of its many advantages, the MINISEP-MS assay has the potential of becoming a useful tool for researchers aiming to identify or create novel enzymes for specific biocatalytic applications.
TI  - Resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a WWTP.
AB  - The microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. Mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. This fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. Molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli (three strains), Enterobacter cloacae, Kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), Kluyvera intermedia, Citrobacter freundii (two strains), Bacillus sp. and Enterobacter sp. The first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.L(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). The results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.L(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees C for 30 min. The other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.L(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). The results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.
TI  - A high-throughput assay for screening L- or D-amino acid specific aminotransferase mutant libraries.
AB  - Aminotransferases are pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes whose potential for the biocatalytic production of enantiopure amino acids is increasingly recognized. Because of this, there is a growing interest in engineering them to alter their substrate specificity and to increase their catalytic activity. Here, we report the development of a high-throughput assay for screening alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent aminotransferase mutant libraries. To achieve this, we exploited the L-glutamate dehydrogenase coupled assay that has previously been shown to allow for aminotransferase activity to be monitored in vitro. We adapted this assay to allow screening of mutant libraries of either L- or D-amino acid specific aminotransferases in a continuous fashion. This assay requiring clarified cell lysates is reproducible, rapid, and sensitive because it allowed for the identification of a catalytically active mutant of Bacillus sp. YM-1 D-amino acid aminotransferase displaying a decrease in k(cat)/K(M) of more than two orders of magnitude. In addition, this assay allowed us to discover a mutant of Escherichia coli branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, F36W, which is approximately 60-fold more specific toward the natural substrate L-leucine than L-phenylalanine as compared with wild type. This result demonstrates the potential of our assay for the discovery of mutant aminotransferases displaying altered substrate specificity, an important goal of enzyme engineering.
TI  - Bioactive metabolites from an endophytic Cryptosporiopsis sp. inhabiting Clidemia hirta.
AB  - An endophytic Cryptosporiopsis sp. was isolated from Clidemia hirta and analyzed  for its secondary metabolites that lead to the isolation of three bioactive molecules. The compounds were purified from the culture broth of the fungus and their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods as (R)-5-hydroxy-2-methylchroman-4-one (1), 1-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)pentan-1-one (2) and (Z)-1-(2-(2-butyryl-3-hydroxyphenoxy)-6-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxybut-2-en-1-one (3). Compound 1 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against the human leukemia cell line, HL-60 with an IC50 of 4 mug/ml. This compound induced G2 arrest of the HL-60 cell cycle significantly. In addition, out of these compounds, 2 and 3 were active against several bacterial pathogens. Compound 2 was active against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with IC50 values varying from 18 to 30 mug/ml, and compound 3 displayed activity against Pseudomonas fluorescens with an IC50 value of 6 mug/ml. Compounds 2 and 3 are novel whereas compound 1 was reported earlier but the stereochemistry of its C-2 methyl is established for the first time.
TI  - Novel affinity purification of monomeric sarcosine oxidase expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - An efficient affinity-purification protocol for Bacillus monomeric sarcosine oxidase (SOX) expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was developed. 4-Aminopyrrole-2-carboxylic acid was chosen as the affinity ligand, which was coupled with Sepharose CL 4B via spacers composed of epichlorohydrin and ethylenediamine. With the affinity medium, the purification process consisted of only one affinity chromatography step to capture monomeric SOX. The purified SOX was 94 and 96% pure when analyzed on an HPLC Vydac C8 column and reducing SDS-PAGE. Meanwhile, the recoveries of typical SOX activity and protein were 90.8 and 37.5%, respectively, which were higher than other reported traditional protocols. Reducing SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the enzyme was a single polypeptide with the mass of ~46 kDa. The desorption constant Kd and theoretical maximum absorption Qmax were 35 mug/mL and 52.7 mg/g, respectively, in absorption analysis. All results indicated that the method would be of great potential for purifying monomeric SOX on an industrial scale.
TI  - A novel cephalosporin deacetylating acetyl xylan esterase from Bacillus subtilis  with high activity toward cephalosporin C and 7-aminocephalosporanic acid.
AB  - A cephalosporin deacetylating acetyl xylan esterase was cloned from the genomic DNA of Bacillus subtilis CICC 20034 and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. Its gene contained an open reading frame of 957 bp encoding 318 amino acids with a calculated mass of 35,607 Da, and it displayed significant identity to acetyl xylan esterases from Bacillus sp. 916, B. subtilis 168, and Bacillus pumilus Cect5072. The enzyme was a native homohexamer but a trimer under the condition of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS); both forms were active and could transit to each other by incubating in or removing SDS. The enzyme belongs to carbohydrate esterase family 7 and had a double specificity on both the acetylated oligosaccharide and cephalosporin C (CPC) and 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA). The activity of this purified enzyme toward CPC and 7-ACA was highest among all the acetyl xylan esterase from CE family 7, which were 484 and 888 U/mg, respectively, and endowed itself with great industrial interest on semi-synthetic beta-lactam antibiotics. The optimum pH of the purified enzyme was 8.0, and the optimum temperature was 50 degrees C, and the enzyme had high thermal stability, broad range of pH tolerance, and extremely organic solvent tolerance.
TI  - Optimization of media and temperature for enhanced antimicrobial production by bacteria associated with Rhabditis sp.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Entomopathogenic nematodes, belonging to the family heterorhabditis and steinernematidae, are reported to be symbiotically associated with specific bacteria and the secondary metabolites produced by these bacteria possess antimicrobial activity. In this study, bacteria were isolated from nematodes belonging to the family rhabditidae, and the antimicrobial activity was tested against four bacteria viz. Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2756, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 902, Escherichia coli MTCC 2622, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 2642 and five fungi viz. Aspergillus flavus MTCC 183, Candida albicans MTCC 277, Fusarium oxysporum MTCC 284, Rhizoctonia solani MTCC 4634 and Penicillium expansum MTCC 2006. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The isolated bacteria were cultured in nutrient broth (NB), Luria broth (LB) and Tryptic soya broth (TSB) at 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. Cell free culture filtrate was prepared by centrifugation and was separated into organic and aqueous fractions. Organic fraction was concentrated and tested for antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: The culture filtrate of the bacteria isolated from the entomopathogenic Rhabditis sp. was found to possess antimicrobial activity against the four bacteria and five fungi tested. The bacterium grew well in TSB, LB and NB media though in TSB yield and activity were higher. Antimicrobial activity was higher at 30 degrees C as compared with 25 or 35 degrees C. HPLC analysis indicated major differences in peak areas and retention times at different temperatures. Increased number of peaks with higher peak areas was obtained at 30 degrees C. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that the bacteria could produce more bioactive molecules effective against medically and agriculturally important bacteria and fungi depending on culture media and temperature. Modified media could yield different types of molecules effective against diseases/disorders of plant, animals and humans.
TI  - Microalgae mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles and their antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles is known to have antimicrobial affects. Cyanobacteria isolates from muthupet mangrove includes Aphanothece sp, Oscillatoria sp, Microcoleus sp, Aphanocapsa sp, Phormidium sp, Lyngbya sp, Gleocapsa sp, Synechococcus sp, Spirulina sp with were set in compliance with their cellular mechanism of nano silver creation, and were investigated by UV-VIS spectrophotometer, Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Silver nanoparticles were spherical shaped well distributed without aggregation in solution with an average size of about 40- 80 nm. Synthesised nano silver had antibacterial production on various organisms that provoked various diseases in humans. The cellular metabolites of Microcoleus sp. only created nano silver and it enhanced the antibacterial activity against test pathogenic bacteria from MTCC (Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholera, Streptococcus sp., Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli.) The antimicrobial assay was performed using 0.001 M concentration of nano silver in well diffusion method with positive control of appropriate standard antibiotic discs Cephotaxime, Ampicillin, Tetracyclin, Cephalexin etc. Synthesised silver nanoparticles acted as an effective antimicrobial agent and proved as an alternative for the development of new antimicrobial agents to combat the problem of resistance.
TI  - Bactericidal efficacy of elevated pH on fish pathogenic and environmental bacteria.
AB  - Ship ballast water is a recognized medium for transfer and introductions of nonindigenous species. There is a need for new ballast water treatment methods that effectively and safely eliminate or greatly minimize movements of these species. The present study employed laboratory methods to evaluate the bactericidal efficacy of increased pH (pH 10.0-12.0) for exposure durations of up to 72 h to kill a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including fish pathogens (Aeromonas spp., Yersinia ruckeri, Edwardsiella ictaluri, Serratia liquefaciens, Carnobacterium sp.), other common aquatic-inhabitant bacteria (Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus sp., Bacillus sp.) and indicators listed in International Maritime Organization D2 Standards; namely, Vibrio cholera (an environmental isolate from fish), Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Volumes of 5 N NaOH were added to tryptic soy broth to obtain desired pH adjustments. Viable cells were determined after 0, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. Initial (0 h) cell numbers ranged from 3.40 x 10(4) cfu/mL for Bacillus sp. to 2.44 x 10(7) cfu/mL for E. faecalis. The effective endpoints of pH and treatment duration necessary to realize 100% bactericidal effect varied; however, all bacteria tested were killed within 72 h at pH 12.0 or lower. The lowest parameters examined, 4 h at pH 10.0, were bactericidal to V. cholera, E. ictaluri, three of four isolates of E. coli, and (three of four) Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. Bactericidal effect was attained at pH 10.0 within 12 h for the other A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, and within 24 h for P. fluorescens, and the remaining E. coli.
TI  - Bioactive phenylalanine derivatives and cytochalasins from the soft coral-derived fungus, Aspergillus elegans.
AB  - One new phenylalanine derivative 4'-OMe-asperphenamate (1), along with one known  phenylalanine derivative (2) and two new cytochalasins, aspochalasin A1 (3) and cytochalasin Z24 (4), as well as eight known cytochalasin analogues (5-12) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Aspergillus elegans ZJ-2008010, a fungus obtained from a soft coral Sarcophyton sp. collected from the South China Sea. Their structures and the relative configurations were elucidated using comprehensive spectroscopic methods. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined by chemical synthesis and Marfey's method. All isolated metabolites (1-12) were evaluated for their antifouling and antibacterial activities. Cytochalasins 5, 6, 8 and 9 showed strong antifouling activity against the larval settlement of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite, with the EC50 values ranging from 6.2 to 37 muM. This is the first report of antifouling activity for this class of metabolites. Additionally, 8 exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, especially against four pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus albus, S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of three variants of the gene encoding alkaline xylanase C from the alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. (NCL 87-6-10).
AB  - Alkaline xylanase C from the alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. (NCL 87-6-10) has a low molecular weight and alkaline pI and is cellulase-free, properties compatible with its use in the prebleaching of pulp. We report here the cloning and sequence analysis of three variants of the gene encoding xylanase C; xyl C1, xyl C2, and xyl C3. In phylogenetic analysis, the three xylanase C variants clustered into a single group along with other reported alkaline xylanases. Residues contributing to the alkaline pH were present in all three variants. DNA and protein sequence comparison of these variants with other reported alkaline xylanases revealed silent mutations, some of which are due to codon preference in the respective organisms. The recombinant Xyl C1 that was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) had properties similar to the native enzyme.
TI  - Efficacy of decontamination and sterilization of a single-use single-incision laparoscopic surgery port.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of decontamination and sterilization of a disposable port intended for use during single-incision laparoscopy. SAMPLE: 5 material samples obtained from each of 3 laparoscopic surgery ports. PROCEDURES: Ports were assigned to undergo decontamination and ethylene oxide sterilization without bacterial inoculation (negative control port), with bacterial inoculation (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium fortuitum) and without decontamination and sterilization (positive control port), or with bacterial inoculation followed by decontamination and ethylene oxide sterilization (treated port). Each port underwent testing 5 times; during each time, a sample of the foam portion of each port was obtained and bacteriologic culture testing was performed. Bacteriologic culture scores were determined for each port sample. RESULTS: None of the treated port samples had positive bacteriologic culture results. All 5 positive control port samples had positive bacteriologic culture results. One negative control port sample had positive bacteriologic culture results; a spore-forming Bacillus sp organism was cultured from that port sample, which was thought to be an environmental contaminant. Bacteriologic culture scores for the treated port samples were significantly lower than those for the positive control port samples. Bacteriologic culture scores for the treated port samples were not significantly different from those for negative control port samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of this study indicated standard procedures for decontamination and sterilization of a single-use port intended for use during singleincision laparoscopic surgery were effective for elimination of inoculated bacteria. Reuse of this port may be safe for laparoscopic surgery of animals.
TI  - cgMolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas.
AB  - A 5.5 kDa antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgMolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and C18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. By comparing the N-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgMolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [MECs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/mL), and Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus ([MECs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/mL), without hemolytic activity. However, cgMolluscidin did not show any significant activity against Candida albicans. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cgMolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (E value = 0) with only the unknown ESTs sequenced by C. gigas EST project. Tissue distribution of the cgMolluscidin mRNA suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. The cgMolluscidin mRNA expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with Vibrio sp. This peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including Lysine-Lysine or Lysine-Arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. These results suggest that cgMolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Microalgae associated Brevundimonas sp. MSK 4 as the nano particle synthesizing unit to produce antimicrobial silver nanoparticles.
AB  - The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles and its antimicrobial property was studied using bacteria isolated from Spirulina products. Isolated bacteria were identified as Bacillus sp. MSK 1 (JX495945), Staphylococcus sp. MSK 2 (JX495946), Bacillus sp. MSK 3 (JX495947) and Brevundimonas sp. MSK 4 (JX495948). Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized using bacterial culture filtrate with AgNO3. The initial syntheses of Ag nanoparticles were characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometer (by measuring the color change to intense brown). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) study showed evidence that proteins are possible reducing agents and Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) study showing the metal silver as major signal. The structure of AgNPs was determined by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Synthesized Ag nanoparticles with an average size of 40-65 nm have antimicrobial property against human pathogens like Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholera, Streptococcus sp., Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Among the isolates Brevundimonas sp. MSK 4 alone showed good activity in both synthesis of AgNPs and antimicrobial activity. This work demonstrates the possible use of biological synthesized silver nanoparticles to combat the drug resistant problem.
TI  - Enhancement of catalysis and functional expression of a bacterial laccase by single amino acid replacement.
AB  - Structure-function relationships underlying laccases properties are very limited  that makes these enzymes interesting for protein engineering approaches. Therefore in the current study, a thermostable laccase that was isolated from Bacillus sp. HR03 with the ability of bilirubin oxidation besides its laccase and tyrosinase activity is used. The extensive application of this enzyme is limited by its low expression level in Escherichia coli. Based on sequence alignments and structural studies, three single amino acid substitutions, D500G, D500E, D500S and a glycine insertion, are introduced using site-directed mutagenesis to evaluate the role of Asp(500) located in the C-terminal segment close to the T1 copper center. Substitution of aspartic acid with less sterically hindered, conserved residue such as glycine increase kcat (2.3 fold) and total activity (7.3 fold) which is accompanied by a significant increase in the expression level up to 3 fold. Biochemical characterization and structural studies using far-UV CD and fluorescence spectroscopy reveal the importance of C-terminal copper-binding loop in the laccase functional expression and catalytic efficiency. Kinetic characterization of the purified mutants toward 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), syringaldazine (SGZ) and bilirubin, shows that substrate specificity is left unchanged.
TI  - Characterization of a new and thermostable esterase from a metagenomic library.
AB  - A new gene encoding an esterase (designated as EstEP16) was identified from a metagenomic library prepared from a sediment sample collected from a deep-sea hydrothermal field in east Pacific. The open reading frame of this gene encoded 249 amino acid residues. It was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity. The monomeric EstEP16 presented a molecular mass of 51.7 kDa. Enzyme assays using p-nitrophenyl esters with different acyl chain lengths as the substrates confirmed its esterase activity, yielding highest specific activity with p-nitrophenyl acetate. When p-nitrophenyl butyrate was used as a substrate, recombinant EstEP16 exhibited highest activity at pH 8.0 and 60 degrees C. The recombinant enzyme retained about 80% residual activity after incubation at 90 degrees C for 6 h, which indicated that EstEP16 was thermostable. Homology modeling of EstEP16 was developed with the monoacylglycerol lipase from Bacillus sp. H-257 as a template. The structure showed an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and indicated the presence of a typical catalytic triad. The activity of EstEP16 was inhibited by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that it contains serine residue, which plays a key role in the catalytic mechanism.
TI  - Synergized antimicrobial activity of eugenol incorporated polyhydroxybutyrate films against food spoilage microorganisms in conjunction with pediocin.
AB  - Biopolymers and biopreservatives produced by microorganisms play an essential role in food technology. Polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacteriocins produced by bacteria are promising components to safeguard the environment and for food preservation applications. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)-based antimicrobial films were prepared incorporating eugenol, from 10 to 200 mug/g of PHB. The films were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, spoilage bacteria, and fungi such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp. The synergistic antimicrobial activity of the films in the presence of crude pediocin was also investigated. The broth system containing pediocin (soluble form) as well as antimicrobial PHB film demonstrated an extended lag phase and a significant growth reduction at the end of 24 h against the bacteria. Crude pediocin alone could not elicit antifungal activity, while inhibition of growth and sporulation were observed in the presence of antimicrobial PHB film containing eugenol (80 mug/g) until 7 days in the case of molds, i.e., A. niger, A. flavus, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp. in potato dextrose broth. In the present study, we identified that use of pediocin containing broth in conjunction with eugenol incorporated PHB film could function in synergized form, providing effective hurdle toward food contaminating microorganisms. Furthermore, tensile strength, percent crystallinity, melting point, percent elongation to break, glass transition temperature, and seal strength of the PHB film with and without eugenol incorporation were investigated. The migration of eugenol on exposure to different liquid food simulants was also analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The study is expected to provide applications for pediocin in conjunction with eugenol containing PHB film to enhance the shelf life of foods in the food industry.
TI  - An efficient in vitro refolding of recombinant bacterial laccase in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Laccases (benzenediol oxygen oxidoreductases, EC 1.10.3.2) are important multicopper enzymes that are used in many biotechnological processes. A recombinant form of laccase from Bacillus sp. HR03 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL-21(DE3). Inclusion body (IB) formation happens quite often during recombinant protein production. Hence, developing a protocol for efficient refolding of proteins from inclusion bodies to provide large amounts of active protein could be advantageous for structural and functional studies. Here, we have tried to find an efficient method of refolding for this bacterial enzyme. Solubilization of inclusion bodies was carried out in phosphate buffer pH 7, containing 8M urea and 4mM beta-mercaptoethanol and refolding was performed using the dilution method. The effect of different additives was investigated on the refolding procedure of denaturated laccase. Mix buffer (phosphate buffer and citrate buffer, 100mM) containing 4mM ZnSO4 and 100mM sorbitol was selected as an optimized refolding buffer. Also Kinetic parameters of soluble and refolded laccase were analyzed.
TI  - Identification of anziaic acid, a lichen depside from Hypotrachyna sp., as a new  topoisomerase poison inhibitor.
AB  - Topoisomerase inhibitors are effective for antibacterial and anticancer therapy because they can lead to the accumulation of the intermediate DNA cleavage complex formed by the topoisomerase enzymes, which trigger cell death. Here we report the application of a novel enzyme-based high-throughput screening assay to identify natural product extracts that can lead to increased accumulation of the DNA cleavage complex formed by recombinant Yersinia pestis topoisomerase I as part of a larger effort to identify new antibacterial compounds. Further characterization and fractionation of the screening positives from the primary assay led to the discovery of a depside, anziaic acid, from the lichen Hypotrachyna sp. as an inhibitor for both Y. pestis and Escherichia coli topoisomerase I. In in vitro assays, anziaic acid exhibits antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and a membrane permeable strain of E. coli. Anziaic acid was also found to act as an inhibitor of human topoisomerase II but had little effect on human topoisomerase I. This is the first report of a depside with activity as a topoisomerase poison inhibitor and demonstrates the potential of this class of natural products as a source for new antibacterial and anticancer compounds.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis flower extract against  human pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To access the in vitro antibacterial activity of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (H. rosa- sinensis) flower extract against human pathogens. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was evaluated by using disc and agar diffusion methods. The protein was run through poly acrylmide gel electrophoresis to view their protein profile. RESULTS: The results showed that the cold extraction illustrates a maximum zone of inhibition against Bacillus subtillis (B. subtillis), Escherichia coli (E. coli) viz., (17.00 +/- 2.91), (14.50 +/- 1.71) mm, followed by hot extraction against, E. coli, Salmonella sp. as (11.66 +/- 3.14), (10.60 +/- 3.09) mm. In methanol extraction showed a highest zone of inhibition recorded against B. subtillis, E. coli as (18.86 +/- 0.18), (18.00 +/- 1.63) mm pursued by ethanol extraction showed utmost zone of inhibition recorded against Salmonella sp. at (20.40 +/- 1.54) mm. The crude protein from flower showed a maximum inhibitory zone observed against Salmonella sp., E. coli viz., (16.55 +/- 1.16), (14.30 +/- 2.86) mm. The flower material can be taken as an alternative source of antibacterial agent against the human pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The extracts of the H. rosa-sinensis are proved to have potential antibacterial activity, further studies are highly need for the drug development.
TI  - Biological activities of selected basidiomycetes from Yemen.
AB  - In a previous paper we demonstrated the results of biological screening of Yemeni basidiomycetes. The present study was aimed to investigate the antimicrobial and the antioxidant activity of further basidiomycetes collected in Yemen. Dichloromethane, methanol and aqueous extracts of the fruiting bodies of 25 species were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activities against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus flavus) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), against six human fungal pathogens (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Aspergillus fumigatus, Mucor sp., Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes) and against one non human pathogenic fungus (Candida maltosa). The results indicated that 75 extracts exhibited activity against one or more of the bacteria. The methanol extracts of Agaricus cf. bernardii, Agrocybe pediades, Chlorophyllum molybdites, Coriolopsis polyzona, Ganoderma xylonoides, Pycnoporus sanguineus, Trametes lactinea and Trametes cingulata showed activity against all tested bacteria. The highest antibacterial activity was exhibited by methanol extracts from Chlorophyllum molybdites, Ganoderma xylonoides and Trametes cingulata and Agaricus cf. bernardii, Agrocybe pediades, Coriolopsis polyzona, Pycnoporus sanguineus and Trametes lactinea. The methanol extracts of Chlorophyllum molybdites, Ganoderma xylonoides and Pycnoporus sanguineus showed considerable antifungal activities against the tested fungal strains. Strong antioxidative effects employing the DPPH assay were exhibited by methanol extracts from Chlorophyllum molybdites, Ganoderma xylonoides, Hexagonia velutina, Pycnoporus sanguineus, Trametes lactinea and Trametes cingulata. Our previous and presented studies about 48 basidiomycetes collected in Yemen provide evidence that basidiomycetes from the Arabic region so far should attract more attention as potential source for new biologically active agents.
TI  - Identification and functional characterization of an alpha-amylase with broad temperature and pH stability from Paenibacillus sp.
AB  - Amylases are important industrial enzymes that have been applied widely in the food, detergent, and pulp industries and fermentation processes. In the present study, a gene encoding an alpha-amylase from the genomic DNA library of Paenibacillus sp. was identified and characterized. The amylase gene designated amy1 was shown to consist of 1,980 bp and shared sequence identity towards alpha-amylase genes from other Bacillus sp. The deduced amino acid sequence for Amy1 indicated 80 % sequence identity with other Bacillus strains. Heterologous expression of recombinant Amy1 in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) facilitated the recovery of this protein in soluble form. Enzyme kinetic data revealed Amy1 to have a K m of 23.83 mg/mL and K cat of 48.74 min(-1) and K cat /K m of 2 min(-1) mg(-1) mL(-1) for starch. The activity of this protein was found to be enhanced by Mn(2+), and furthermore, Amy1 remained active at a broad pH range (4-10) and temperature (30-90 degrees C). The ability of Amy1 to act on food waste under broad temperature and pH conditions, together with its ability to produce simple sugars, shows many advantages for further application in the food industry.
TI  - Bioactive polyoxygenated steroids from the South China sea soft coral, Sarcophyton sp.
AB  - Seven new polyoxygenated steroids (1-7) were isolated together with seven known analogues (8-14) from the South China Sea soft coral, Sarcophyton sp. The structures of the new compounds were identified on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison with reported data. All the steroids are characterized with 3beta,5alpha,6beta-hydroxy moiety, displaying carbon skeletons of cholestane, ergostane, gorgostane and 23,24-dimethyl cholestane. In the in vitro bioassay, metabolites exhibited different levels of antimicrobial activity against bacterial species Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium, and fungal species Microbotryum violaceum and Septoria tritici. No inhibition was detected towards microalga Chlorella fusca. Preliminary structure-activity analysis suggests that the 11alpha-acetoxy group may increase both antibacterial and antifungal activities. The terminal-double bond and the cyclopropane moiety at the side chain may also contribute to the bioactivity.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Cichorium intybus root extract using  orthogonal matrix design.
AB  - Solvent, impregnation time, sonication repetitions, and ultrasonic power were important factors in the process of ultrasound-assisted extraction from chicory (Cichorium intybus) root, while there were no studies about optimizing these 4 factors for extract yield, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activity of the extracts using orthogonal matrix design. The present research demonstrated that the solvent composition played a significant role in the improving extract yield, TPC, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. The other 3 factors had inequable effect on different purposes, ultrasonic power could improve TPC and antioxidant activity, but long time of extraction lowered antioxidant activity. The TPC increased from 22.34 to 27.87 mg GAE (gallic acid equivalents)/100 g (dry extracts) with increasing solvent polarity. The half inhibition concentration (IC(50,) mug/mL) of the radical scavenging activity of the chicory extracts ranged from 281.00 to 983.33 mug/mL. The content of caffeoylquinic acids of root extract, which was extracted by the optimal combination was 0.104%. Several extracts displayed antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella typhi, while Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. resisted against all the extracts. Combination of 70% ethanol v/v, 24-h impregnation time, 3 sonication rounds, and 300-W ultrasonic input power was found to be the optimal combination for the chicory extract yield, TPC, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Characterisation of a novel Bacillus sp. SJ-10 beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase isolated from jeotgal, a traditional Korean fermented fish.
AB  - A novel beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase gene was identified in Bacillus sp. SJ-10 (KCCM 90078) isolated from jeotgal, a traditional Korean fermented fish. We analysed the beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase gene sequence and examined the recombinant enzyme. The open reading frame of the gene encoded 244 amino acids. The sequence was not identical to any beta-glucanases deposited in GenBank. The gene was cloned into pET22b(+) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Purification of recombinant beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase was conducted by affinity chromatography using a Ni-NTA column. Enzyme specificity of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase was confirmed based on substrate specificity. The optimal temperature and pH of the purified enzyme towards barley beta-glucan were 50 degrees C and pH 6, respectively. More than 80 % of activity was retained at temperatures of 30-70 degrees C and pH values of 4-9, which differed from all other bacterial beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases. The degradation products of barley beta-glucan by beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase were analysed using thin-layer chromatography, and ultimately glucose was produced by treatment with cellobiase.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude plant extracts from Colombian biodiversity.
AB  - On a global scale, people have used plants to treat diseases and infections, and  this has raised interest on the plant biodiversity potencial in the search of antimicrobial principles. In this work, 75 crude n-hexanes, dichloromethane and methanol extracts from the aerial parts of 25 plants belonging to four botanical families (Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae and Solanaceae), collected at the Natural Regional Park Ucumari (Risaralda, Colombia), were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities by the agar well diffusion method. The antibacterial activities were assayed against two Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, and three Gram-negative ones named, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, the same plant extracts were tested against the yeast Candida albicans and the fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium solani. Overall, the plant extracts examined displayed better bactericide rather than fungicide activities. In general, the best antibacterial activity was showed by the plant extracts from the Rubiaceae family, followed in order by the extracts from the Euphorbiaceae and Solanaceae ones. It is important to emphasize the great activity displayed by the methanol extract of Alchornea coelophylla (Euphorbiaceae) that inhibited four out of five bacteria tested (B. Subtilis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and E. coli). Furthermore, the best Minimal Inhibitory Concentration for the extracts with antifungal activities were displayed by the dichloromethane extracts from Acalypha diversifolia and Euphorbia sp (Euphorbiaceae). The most susceptible fungus evaluated was F. Solani since 60% and 20% of the dichloromethane and methanol extracts evaluated inhibited the growth of this phytopathogenic fungus. The antimicrobial activity of the different plant extracts examined in this work could be related to the secondary metabolites contents and their interaction and susceptibility of pathogenic microorganism evaluated.
TI  - Improvement of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase gene expression in Escherichia coli by insertion of regulatory sequences involved in the promotion of RNA transcription.
AB  - Regulation of RNA transcription in controlling the expression of genes at promoter and terminator regions is crucial as the interaction of RNA polymerase occurred at both sites. Gene encoding cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) from Bacillus sp. NR5 UPM isolated in the previous study was used for further construction of pTZCGT-SS, pTZCGT-BS and pTZCGT-BT expression systems for enhancement of CGTase production. The putative promoter regions, -35 and -10 sequences were found in the upstream of the mature gene start codon. Whereas, long inverted repeats sequences which can form a stable stem and loop structure was found downstream of the open reading frame (ORF) of Bacillus sp. NR5 UPM CGTase. The construction of E. coli strain harbouring pTZCGT-BS showed increment of 3.2-fold in CGTase activity compared to the wild type producer. However, insertion of terminator downstream of CGTase gene in E. coli strain harbouring pTZCGT-BT only resulted in 4.42 % increment of CGTase production compared to E. coli strain containing pTZCGT-BS, perhaps due to low intrinsic termination efficiency. Thus, it is suggested that the insertion of the putative promoter regions upstream of the coding sequence for the construction of CGTase expression system will further enhance in the recombinant enzyme production.
TI  - Gene identification and recombinant protein of a lysozyme from freshwater mussel  Cristaria plicata.
AB  - Lysozymes are important proteins to bivalve in the innate immune responses against bacterial infections, and provide nutrition as digestion enzymes. A new LYZ1 from the freshwater mussel Cristaria plicata was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and nested PCR method. The full-length cDNA sequence of CpLYZ1 was 763 bp. The cDNA contained a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 21 bp, a 3'- terminal UTR of 259 bp with a 29 bp poly(A) tail, a tailing signal (AATAAA) and the open reading frame of 483 bp. The CpLYZ1 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 160 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.8 kDa, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.07. The comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with LYZs from other species showed that the enzyme belonged to i-type lysozyme. The mRNA transcript of CpLYZ1 could be detected in all the examined tissues with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. The expression levels of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes, hepatopancreas and gill significantly increased after Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. The expression level of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes sharply decreased from 6 h to 24 h and significantly increased at 48 h, and was the highest level in hepatopancreas at 24 h, and was the maximum level in gill at 48 h. Furthermore, the recombinant CpLYZ1 was induced to be expressed as an inclusion body form by IPTG at 37 degrees C for 4 h, and then was purified by using the Ni(2+) affinity chromatography. The relative enzyme activity of the recombinant CpLYZ1 was influenced on pH and temperature. The optimal pH and temperature was 5.5 and 50 degrees C, respectively. Against Escherichia coli, A. hydrophila, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus sp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the recombinant CpLYZ1 had bacteriolytic activity.
TI  - Structural and stereochemical studies of hydroxyanthraquinone derivatives from the endophytic fungus Coniothyrium sp.
AB  - Four known hydroxyanthraquinones (1-4) together with four new derivatives having  a tetralone moiety, namely coniothyrinones A-D (5-8), were isolated from the culture of Coniothyrium sp., an endophytic fungus isolated from Salsola oppostifolia from Gomera in the Canary Islands. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis and comparison with reported data. The absolute configurations of coniothyrinones A (5), B (6), and D (8) were determined by TDDFT calculations of CD spectra, allowing the determination of the absolute configuration of coniothyrinone C (7) as well. Coniothyrinones A (5), B (6), and D (8) could be used as ECD reference compounds in the determination of absolute configuration for related tetralone derivatives. This is the first report of anthraquinones and derivatives from an isolate of the genus Coniothyrium sp. These compounds showed inhibitory effects against the fungus Microbotryum violaceum, the alga Chlorella fusca, and the bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium.
TI  - Diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in North-Western Iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by Leishmania spp. Little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. Particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. This information is important for development of vector control strategies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: FIVE SAND FLY SPECIES: Phlebotomus papatasi, P. sergenti, P. kandelakii, P. perfiliewi and P. halepensis were caught in Bileh Savar and Kaleybar in North-Western Iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. A total of 35 specimens were processed. Bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. We characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. They belong to six different genera including Penicillium (17 isolates), Aspergillus (14), Acremonium (5), Fusarium (1), Geotrichum (1) and Candida (1). We identified 33 Gram-negative bacteria: Serratia marcescens (9 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Pseudomonas fluorescens (6), Klebsiella ozaenae (4), Acinetobacter sp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Asaia sp. (1) and Pantoea sp. (1) as well as Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis (5) and Micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of Asaia sp. in sand flies. We have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. Interestingly Pantoea sp. and Klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in Old World sand fly species. The presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. Further experiments are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand flies.
TI  - Actinopyga lecanora hydrolysates as natural antibacterial agents.
AB  - Actinopyga lecanora, a type of sea cucumber commonly known as stone fish with relatively high protein content, was explored as raw material for bioactive peptides production. Six proteolytic enzymes, namely alcalase, papain, pepsin, trypsin, bromelain and flavourzyme were used to hydrolyze A. lecanora at different times and their respective degrees of hydrolysis (DH) were calculated. Subsequently, antibacterial activity of the A. lecanora hydrolysates, against some common pathogenic Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas sp.) were evaluated. Papain hydrolysis showed the highest DH value (89.44%), followed by alcalase hydrolysis (83.35%). Bromelain hydrolysate after one and seven hours of hydrolysis exhibited the highest antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas sp., P. aeruginosa and E. coli at 51.85%, 30.07% and 30.45%, respectively compared to the other hydrolysates. Protein hydrolysate generated by papain after 8 h hydrolysis showed maximum antibacterial activity against S. aureus at 20.19%. The potent hydrolysates were further fractionated using RP-HPLC and antibacterial activity of the collected fractions from each hydrolysate were evaluated, wherein among them only three fractions from the bromelain hydrolysates exhibited inhibitory activities against Pseudomonas sp., P. aeruginosa and E. coli at 24%, 25.5% and 27.1%, respectively and one fraction of papain hydrolysate showed antibacterial activity of 33.1% against S. aureus. The evaluation of the relationship between DH and antibacterial activities of papain and bromelain hydrolysates revealed a meaningful correlation of four and six order functions.
TI  - Biochemical basis of mercury remediation and bioaccumulation by Enterobacter sp.  EMB21.
AB  - The aims of this study were to isolate metal bioaccumulating bacterial strains and to study their applications in removal of environmental problematic heavy metals like mercury. Five bacterial strains belonging to genera Enterobacter, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas were isolated from oil-spilled soil. Among these, one of the strains Enterobacter sp. EMB21 showed mercury bioaccumulation inside the cells simultaneous to its bioremediation. The bioaccumulation of remediated mercury was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray. The mercury-resistant loci in the Enterobacter sp. EMB21 cells were plasmid-mediated as confirmed by transformation of mercury-sensitive Escherichia coli DH5alpha by Enterobacter sp. EMB21 plasmid. Effect of different culture parameters viz-a-viz inoculum size, pH, carbon, and nitrogen source revealed that alkaline pH and presence of dextrose and yeast extract favored better remediation. The results indicated the usefulness of Enterobacter sp. EMB21 for the effective remediation of mercury in bioaccumulated form. The Enterobacter sp. EMB21 seems promising for heavy metal remediation wherein the remediated metal can be trapped inside the cells. The process can further be developed for the synthesis of valuable high-end functional alloy, nanoparticles, or metal conjugates from the metal being remediated.
TI  - Cloning, expression, characterization, and biocatalytic investigation of a novel  bacilli thermostable type I pullulanase from Bacillus sp. CICIM 263.
AB  - The pulA1 gene, encoding a novel thermostable type I pullulanase PulA1 from Bacillus sp. CICIM 263, was identified from genomic DNA. The open reading frame of the pulA1 gene was 2655 base pairs long and encoded a polypeptide (PulA1) of 885 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 100,887 Da. The pulA1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Recombinant PuLA1 showed optimal activity at pH 6.5 and 70 degrees C. The enzyme demonstrated moderate thermostability as PuLA1 maintained more than 88% of its acitivity when incubated at 70 degrees C for 1 h. The enzyme could completely hydrolyze pullulan to maltotriose, and hydrolytic activity was also detected with glycogen, starch and amylopection, but not with amylose, which is consistent with the property of type I pullulanase. PulA1 may be suitable for industrial applications to improve the yields of fermentable sugars for bioethanol production.
TI  - Two new alkaloids from marine sponge Callyspongia sp.
AB  - Two new alkaloids, callylactam A (1) and callyimine A (4), along with three known ones (2, 3 and 5), were isolated from the marine sponge Callyspongia sp. The structures were determined on the basis of NMR and MS analysis.
TI  - Antibiotic and antimalarial quinones from fungus-growing ant-associated Pseudonocardia sp.
AB  - Three new members of the angucycline class of antibiotics, pseudonocardones A-C (1-3), along with the known antibiotics 6-deoxy-8-O-methylrabelomycin (4) and X-14881 E (5) have been isolated from the culture of a Pseudonocardia strain associated with the fungus-growing ant Apterostigma dentigerum. Compounds 4 and 5 showed antibiotic activity against Bacillus subtilis 3610 and liver-stage Plasmodium berghei, while 1-3 were inactive or only weakly active in a variety of biological assays. Compound 5 also showed moderate cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of ozonated water on the sanitization of dental instruments contaminated with E. coli, S. aureus, C. albicans, or the spores of B. atrophaeus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ozone has been used as an alternative method for the decontamination  of water, food, equipment and instruments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of ozonated water on the sanitization of dental instruments that were contaminated by Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and the spores of Bacillus atrophaeus. METHODS: A total of one hundred and twenty standardized samples of diamond dental burs were experimentally contaminated with E. coli (ATCC 25922), S. aureus (ATCC 6538) and C. albicans (ATCC 18804) and the spores of B. atrophaeus (ATCC 6633) for 30 min. After the contamination, the samples were exposed to ozonated water (10mg/L O(3)) for 10 or 30min. The control group was composed of samples that were exposed to distilled water for 30 min. After the exposure to the ozonated water, 0.1 mL aliquots were seeded onto BHI agar to count the colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) of E. coli, S. aureus, and B. atrophaeus. Sabouraud dextrose agar was used to count the CFU/mL of C. albicans. The results were subjected to an analysis of variance and the Tukey test. RESULTS: For all of the microorganisms studied, the ozonated water reduced the number of CFU/mL after 10 and 30 min of sanitization, and this microbial reduction was dependent on the duration of the exposure to the ozonated water. E. coli exhibited the greatest reduction in CFU/mL (2.72-3.78 log) followed by S. aureus (2.14-3.19 log), C. albicans (1.44-2.14 log) and the spores of B. atrophaeus (1.01-1.98 log). CONCLUSION: The ozonated water was effective in reducing the CFU of E. coli, S. aureus, C. albicans and B. atrophaeus spores, suggesting that ozonated water can be used for the sanitization of dental instruments.
TI  - Production of alpha-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase in Bacillus megaterium MS941 by systematic codon usage optimization.
AB  - alpha-Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase is a key enzyme in the cyclodextrin industry. The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium was chosen for production of recombinant alpha-CGTase for safety concerns. Successful production of heterologous alpha-CGTase was achieved by adapting the original alpha-cgt gene to the codon usage of B. megaterium by systematic codon optimization. This balanced the tRNA pool and reduced ribosomal traffic jams. Protein expression and secretion was ensured by using the strong inducible promoter P(xyl) and the signal peptide SP(LipA). The impact of culture medium composition and induction strategies on alpha-CGTase production was systematically analyzed. Production and secretion at 32 degrees C for 24 h using modified culture medium was optimal for alpha-CGTase yield. Batch- and simple fed-batch fermentation was applied to achieve a high yield of 48.9 U.mL(-1), which was the highest activity reported for a Bacillus species, making this production system a reasonable alternative to Escherichia coli.
TI  - A piscidin-like antimicrobial peptide from the icefish Chionodraco hamatus (Perciformes: Channichthyidae): molecular characterization, localization and bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered one of the most ancient components of the innate immune system. They are able to exert their protection activity against a variety of microorganisms, and are widely distributed in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In this paper we focused on an AMP identified in the Antarctic teleost Chionodraco hamatus, an icefish species. The cDNA sequence of the AMP, named chionodracine, is comprised of 515 bp and translates for a putative protein precursor of 80 amino acids, with a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. The structural features evidenced in the primary sequence of chionodracine lead to the inclusion of the peptide in the antimicrobial family of piscidins. The analysis by real-time PCR of the basal gene transcripts of chionodracine in different icefish tissues showed that the highest expression was found in gills, followed by head kidney. The chionodracine expression levels in head kidney leukocytes were up-regulated in vitro both by LPS and poly I:C, and in vivo by LPS. A putative chionodracine mature peptide was synthesized and employed to obtain a polyclonal antiserum, which was used in immunohistochemistry of gills sections and revealed a significant positivity associated with mast cells. The bactericidal activity of the peptide was investigated and found significant against Antarctic psychrophilic bacteria strains (Psychrobacter sp. TAD1 and TA144), the Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, and at a lesser extent against the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Interestingly, the haemolytic activity of chionodracine was tested in vitro on human erythrocytes and no significant lysis occurred until peptide concentration of 50 muM.
TI  - The effect of environmental conditions on biofilm formation of Burkholderia pseudomallei clinical isolates.
AB  - Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Gram-negative saprophytic bacterium, is the causative agent of the potentially fatal melioidosis disease in humans. In this study, environmental parameters including temperature, nutrient content, pH and the presence of glucose were shown to play a role in in vitro biofilm formation by 28 B. pseudomallei clinical isolates, including four isolates with large colony variants (LCVs) and small colony variants (SCVs) morphotypes. Enhanced biofilm formation was observed when the isolates were tested in LB medium, at 30 degrees C, at pH 7.2, and in the presence of as little as 2 mM glucose respectively. It was also shown that all SVCs displayed significantly greater capacity to form biofilms than the corresponding LCVs when cultured in LB at 37 degrees C. In addition, octanoyl-homoserine lactone (C(8)-HSL), a quorum sensing molecule, was identified by mass spectrometry analysis in bacterial isolates referred to as LCV CTH, LCV VIT, SCV TOM, SCV CTH, 1 and 3, and the presence of other AHL's with higher masses; decanoyl-homoserine lactone (C(10)-HSL) and dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone (C(12)-HSL) were also found in all tested strain in this study. Last but not least, we had successfully acquired two Bacillus sp. soil isolates, termed KW and SA respectively, which possessed strong AHLs degradation activity. Biofilm formation of B. pseudomallei isolates was significantly decreased after treated with culture supernatants of KW and SA strains, demonstrating that AHLs may play a role in B. pseudomallei biofilm formation.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of polyketide metabolite from marine Streptomyces sp. AP-123 and its cytotoxic effect.
AB  - A Gram positive, filamentous, spore forming antagonistic Streptomyces sp. AP-123  derived from marine region of Andra Pradesh, India, was studied for its medical importance. Among the 210 Streptomyces strains screened at 64.3% exhibited activity against Gram positive bacteria, 48.5% showed activity towards Gram negative bacteria, 38.8% exhibited both Gram positive and negative bacteria and 80.85% strains revealed significant antifungal activity. However, primary screening revealed that Streptomyces sp. AP-123 exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against all the tested bacteria compared to other Streptomyces strains. The presence of l-diaminopimelic acid and glycine in the cell wall hydrolysates and streptomycin resistance indicated the strain belonged to Streptomyces genus. The 16S rDNA gene based phylogenetic affiliation was determined by using bioinformatic tools and it was identified as Streptomyces sp. AP-123 with 99% sequence similarity to Streptomyces flavogriseus. The antimicrobial substances were extracted by hexane and ethyl acetate from spent medium in which Streptomyces sp. AP-123 was cultivated at 30 degrees C for 5 d. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using broth micro-dilution technique. A compound was obtained by eluting the crude extract using varying concentrations of solvents followed by the chromatographic purification. Based on the IR, (13)C NMR and (1)H NMR spectral data, the compound was identified as polyketide related antibiotic. It exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and also showed a potent cytotoxic activity against cell lines viz. Vero (Green monkey kidney) and HEP2 (laryngeal carcinoma cells) in vitro. The lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the compound against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus were 25 and 37.5 mug mL(-1), respectively. Against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa it exhibited MIC of 50 and 37.58 mug mL(-1), respectively. However, against Candida albicans and filamentous fungus, Aspergillus niger the MIC values were 12.5 and 25 mug mL(-1), respectively. Cloning and sequence analysis of ketoacyl synthase (KS) gene revealed similarity to the type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene of Streptomyces species.
TI  - Bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a polymorphic disease. It is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process. However, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. MATERIAL/METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected ZCL and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. Microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate ZCL from non-ZCL lesions in a rural area north of Isfahan, Iran from July to December 2009. Bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: The results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for ZCL, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of ZCL. The bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of ZCL (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-ZCL lesions. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and S. epidermidis (28%) followed by Bacillus sp. Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Cefazolin and Clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in ZCL, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-ZCL lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL). Local lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the treatment of ZCL.
TI  - Optimization of a Bacillus sp signal peptide for improved recombinant protein secretion and cell viability in Escherichia coli: Is there an optimal signal peptide design?
AB  - Recombinant protein fused to an N-terminal signal peptide can be translocated to  the periplasm and, eventually, to the extracellular medium of Escherichia coli under specific conditions. In this communication, we described the use and optimization of a heterologous signal peptide (G1 signal peptide) from a Bacillus sp for improved recombinant protein secretion and cell viability in E. coli. Significant advantages in maintaining high cell viability and high specificity of target protein secretion were achieved by using G1 signal peptide compared to the well-known PelB signal peptide. Signal peptide sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of G1 signal peptide demonstrated that an 'MKK' sequence in n-region and the presence of a helix-breaking residue at the centre of h-region are important elements for the design of an optimal signal peptide.
TI  - Cloning, expression and characterization of a novel salt-tolerant xylanase from Bacillus sp. SN5.
AB  - A xylanase gene (xyn10A) was cloned from Bacillus sp. SN5 and expressed in Escherichia coli. It encoded a 348-residue polypeptide of ~45 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence had 68 % identity with the endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from Paenibacillus lactis 154 that belonged to family 10 of the glycoside hydrolases. Purified recombinant Xyn10A had maximum activity at 40 degrees C and pH 7.0, with the specific activity of 105 U/mg and a Km of 0.6 mg/ml for beechwood xylan. Xyn10A retained more than 80 % activity between 25 and 45 degrees C and 29 % activity at 5 degrees C. It exhibited the highest activity (134 %) in 0.5 M NaCl and still retained 90 % activity in 2.5 M NaCl. It retained about 87 % activity after incubation in 2 M NaCl for 24 h. The cold-active and halo-tolerant properties of Xyn10A make it promising for application in the food industry, especially in the processing of saline food and sea food.
TI  - Gilvocarcin HE: a new polyketide glycoside from Streptomyces sp.
AB  - A new antimicrobial polyketide glycoside (1) and three known compounds, gilvocarcins H (2), V (3) and M (4) were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of Streptomyces sp. QD01-2. The structure of (1) was established by spectroscopic analysis, X-ray single crystal diffraction and CD spectra. The new compound (1) showed potent antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans, with MIC values of 0.5-5.0 muM. Compound (1) also showed weak cytotoxicity against the MCF-7, K562 and P388 cell lines, with IC(50) values of 36, 39 and 45 muM, respectively. The results showed that the vinyl side chain helps to increase the cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activities of gilvocarcin-type glycosides. In addition, the NMR data of gilvocarcin H (2) were also reported for the first time.
TI  - A new large - Scale synthesis of magnesium oxide nanowires: Structural and antibacterial properties.
AB  - Large-scale one-dimensional magnesium oxide (MgO) nanowires with diameters of 6 nm and lengths of 10 mum have been successfully synthesized by a new facile and simple reaction. This production was performed via a microwave hydrothermal approach at low temperature growth of 180 degrees C for 30 min. The structure of as synthesized MgO nanowires were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (X-ray), Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDS). The antibacterial behavior of MgO nanowires concentration in solid media against Gram negative and Gram positive for different bacteria has been tested in details. The results show that the MgO nanowires have bacteriostatic activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus sp. The antibacterial activity increases with increasing MgO nanowires concentration. Furthermore, the presence of one-dimensional MgO nanowires has high antibacterial efficacy and damages the membrane wall of bacteria. Finally, this study offered the prospect of developing ultrafine nanoscale devices utilizing MgO nanowires and implementing their useful potential in biological control.
TI  - Chemical and biological characterization of sclerosin, an antifungal lipopeptide.
AB  - Pseudomonas sp. strain DF41 produces a lipopeptide, called sclerosin that inhibits the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum . The aim of the current study was to deduce the chemical structure of this lipopeptide and further characterize its bioactivity. Mass spectrometry analysis determined the structure of sclerosin to be CH(3)-(CH(2))(6)-CH(OH)-CH(2)-CO-Dhb-Pro-Ala-Leu/Ile-Ala-Val-Val-Dhb-Thr-Val-Leu/ Ile-Dhp-Ala-Ala-Ala-Val-Dhb-Dhb-Ala-Dab-Ser-Val-OH, similar to corpeptins A and B of the tolaasin group, differing by only 3 amino acids in the peptide chain. Subjecting sclerosin to various ring opening procedures revealed no new ions, suggesting that this molecule is linear. As such, sclerosin represents a new member of the tolaasin lipopeptide group. Incubation of S. sclerotinia ascospores and sclerotia in the presence of sclerosin inhibited the germination of both cell types. Sclerosin also exhibited antimicrobial activity against Bacillus species. Conversely, this lipopeptide demonstrated no zoosporicidal activity against the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans . Next, we assessed the effect of DF41 and a lipopeptide-deficient mutant on the growth and development of Caenorhabditis elegans larvae. We discovered that sclerosin did not protect DF41 from ingestion by and degradation in the C. elegans digestive tract. However, another metabolite produced by this bacterium appeared to shorten the life-span of the nematode compared to C. elegans growing on Escherichia coli OP50.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of stuffed mussels sold in the streets.
AB  - Stuffed mussel is a traditional food that sold by street venders in various countries. In the present study, samples of stuffed mussels were collected from various places in Ankara. The mussels were analyzed to show the microbiological risks for human health. Thirty samples (600 stuffed mussels in total) were collected periodically and microbiological analyses were performed by standard procedures for Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Clostridium sp. In terms of Salmonella sp., approximately 50% of samples were not suitable for consumption. Besides, in accordance with Turkish Food Codex Microbiological Criteria Announcement in terms of E. coli 30%, in terms of B. cereus 80%, in terms of S. aureus 76.6%, in terms of Clostridium perfringens 13.3% of these samples were not suitable for consumption. The aim of this study is to discuss the microbiological quality of stuffed mussels as a ready-to-eat food according to Turkish Food Codex (TFC). The result of this investigation indicates that stuffed mussels as a street food may constitute a potential health hazard, depending on contamination level and lack of sanitary practices, and therefore, handling practices should require more attention and improvement.

TI  - l-Asparaginase Production by Moderate Halophilic Bacteria Isolated from Maharloo  Salt Lake.
AB  - l-Asparaginase is an anti-neoplastic drug used in lymphoblastic leukemia chemotherapy. Nowadays, this enzyme derived from bacterial sources, mostly l-asparaginase II from Escherichia coli and in lesser amount l-asparaginase of Erwinia sp. has medical utilization. The long-term usage of these agents leads to allergic reactions and new asparaginase with new immunological characteristics is required. Halophilic bacteria might contain l-asparaginase with novel immunological properties that can be used in hypersensitive patients. In this experiment, we have screened moderate Halophilic bacteria for l-asparaginase production ability and showed that Halophilic bacteria produce intra- and extracellular l-asparaginase. Bacillus sp. BCCS 034 was found to produce the highest l-asparaginase (1.64 IU/ml supernatant) extracellularly.
TI  - Identification of antimicrobial compound, diketopiperazines, from a Bacillus sp.  N strain associated with a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode against major plant pathogenic fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To purify and characterize antimicrobial compounds from Bacillus sp. strain N associated with rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode (EPN). METHODS AND RESULTS: The cell-free culture filtrate of a bacterium associated with an EPN, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp., exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain three diketopiperazines (DKPs). The structure and absolute stereochemistry of this compound were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1) H NMR, (13) C NMR, (1) H-(1) H COSY, (1) H-(13) C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu), cyclo(d-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro-l-Tyr), respectively. Three DKPs were active against all the five fungi tested (Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani and Penicillium expansum) and are more effective than the standard fungicide bavistin. The highest activity of 4 mug ml(-1) by cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro-l-Tyr) was recorded against P. expansum, a plant pathogen responsible for causing postharvest decay of stored apples and oranges. Cyclo(d-Pro-l-Leu) recorded good antibacterial activity against all the four bacteria tested (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro-l-Tyr) recorded good activity only against Gram-positive bacteria. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of the DKPs against the plant pathogenic fungi F. oxysporum, R. solani and P. expansum. The production of cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu), cyclo(d-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo-(d-Pro-l-Tyr) by a bacterium associated with EPN is also reported here for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated DKPs demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, especially against plant pathogenic fungi. We conclude that the bacterium associated with EPN is a promising source of natural bioactive secondary metabolites which may receive great benefit in the field of agriculture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study is a significant contribution to the knowledge of compounds unique from EPN bacteria as potential sources of new drugs in the agricultural and pharmacological industry.
TI  - Production of XynX, a large multimodular protein of thermoanaerobacterium sp., by protease-deficient Bacillus subtilis strains [corrected].
AB  - XynX of Thermoanaerobacterium sp. [corrected] is a large, multimodular xylanase of 116 kDa. An Escherichia coli transformant carrying the entire xynX produced three active truncated xylanase species of 105, 85, and 64 kDa intracellularly. The Bacillus subtilis WB700 transformant with the xynX, a strain deficient in seven proteases including Vpr, secreted two active truncated xylanase species of 65 and 44 kDa. The B. subtilis WB800 transformant with xynX, a strain deficient in eight proteases including Vpr and WprA, secreted more active enzymes, 8.46 U ml(-1), mostly in the form of 105 and 85 kDa, than the WB700 transformant, 6.93 U ml(-1). This indicates that the additional deletion of wprA enabled the WB800 to secrete XynX in its intact form. B. subtilis WB800 produced more total enzyme activity than E. coli (1,692 +/- 274 U vs. 141.9 +/- 27.1 U), and, more importantly, secreted almost all the enzyme activity. The results suggest the potential use of B. subtilis WB800 as a host system for the production of large multimodular proteins.
TI  - Development of eco-friendly bioplastic like PHB by distillery effluent microorganisms.
AB  - During screening for poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) producing bacteria from distillery effluent sample, six out of 30 isolates comprising of three strains of Alcaligenes sp., two strains of Bacillus sp., and one strain of Pseudomonas sp. were found to accumulate varying levels of intracellular PHB. Amongst the various isolates, Alcaligenes sp. RZS4 was found as the potent PHB-producing organism, accumulating higher amounts of PHB. PHB productivity was further enhanced in the presence of oxygen, nitrogen-limiting conditions, and cloning of PHB synthesizing genes of Alcaligenes sp. RZS 4 into Escherichia coli. A twofold increase in PHB yield was obtained from recombinant E. coli vis-a-vis Alcaligenes sp.; the recombinant E. coli accumulated more PHB in NDMM, produced good amount of PHB in a single-stage cultivation process under both nutrient-rich and nutrient-deficient conditions. Extraction of PHB with acetone-alcohol (1:1) was found as suitable method for optimum extraction of PHB as this mixture selectively extracted PHB without affecting the non-PHB cell mass. PHB extract from recombinant E. coli showed the presence of C-H, =O stretching, =C-H deformation, =C-H, =CH, and =C-O functional groups characteristic of PHB.
TI  - Investigations on possible roles of C-terminal propeptide of a Ca-independent alpha-amylase from bacillus.
AB  - Previously, an extracellular alpha-amylase (BKA) had been purified from the culture of Bacillus sp. KR8104. Subsequently, the crystal structure of the active enzyme revealed a 422 amino acids polypeptide. In this study, the bka was cloned into E. coli, which encoded a polypeptide of 659 amino acids including two additional fragments: one 44 residues N-terminal fragment and another 193 residues C-terminal fragment. In order to investigate the role of the C-terminal fragment, two constructs with and without this region [BKADelta(N44) and BKADelta(N44C193)] were designed and expressed in E. coli BL21. The optimum pH, thermal stability, and the end-products of starch hydrolysis were found to be similar in both constructs. The Km and V(max) values for BKADelta(N44) were lower than BKADelta(N44C193), using either starch or ethylidene-blocked 4-nitrophenylmaltoheptaoside as a substrate.
TI  - Enzymatic characterization of Bacillus licheniformis gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase fused with N-terminally truncated forms of Bacillus sp. TS-23 alpha-amylase.
AB  - Bacillus licheniformis gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (BlGGT) was fused at its C-terminal end with N-terminally truncated forms of Bacillus sp. TS-23 alpha-amylase. BlGGT and six fusion enzymes, BlGGT/SBD, BlGGT/AMYDeltaN476, BlGGT/AMYDeltaN443, BlGGT/AMYDeltaN376, BlGGT/AMYDeltaN195, and BlGGT/AMYDeltaN34, were over-expressed in Escherichia coli M15 cells and purified to apparent homogeneity by metal-affinity chromatography. The fusion constructions had no significant effect on the autocatalytic processing of BlGGT. Progressive decrease in the GGT activity of fusion proteins was associated with an increasing level of truncation, and only BlGGT/AMYDeltaN34 reserved the amylolytic activity. The protein fusions did not alter the optimal temperature and pH of BlGGT. However, as compared with the parental BlGGT, a significant change in circular dichorism and fluorescence spectra was observed in the fusion enzymes. Thermal unfolding of BlGGT, BlGGT/AMYDeltaN476, BlGGT/AMYDeltaN443, and BlGGT/AMYDeltaN376 followed the two-state unfolding process with a transition point (T(m)) of 61.3-63.1 degrees C, whereas BlGGT/AMYDeltaN195 and BlGGT/AMYDeltaN34 displayed two temperature transitions at 40.6 and 46.7 degrees C as well as at 62.8 and 62.9 degrees C, respectively. All of the fusion enzymes exhibited the raw-starch-binding ability, and the adsorbed proteins could be eluted from the adsorbent by 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 2% soluble starch.
TI  - Novel polymer anchored Cr(III) Schiff base complexes: synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - New polymer-bound Schiff bases and Cr(III) complexes have been synthesized by the reaction of 4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde, polymer-bound with 2-aminophenol, 2-amino-4-chlorophenol and 2-amino-4-methylphenol. The structure of polymeric-Schiff bases and their Cr(III) complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, IR, UV-Vis, TG-DTA and (1)H-NMR. All these compounds have also been investigated for antibacterial activity by the well-diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus (RSKK-07035), Shigella dysenteria type 10 (RSKK 1036), Listeria monocytogenes 4b(ATCC 19115, Escherichia coli (ATCC 1230), Salmonella typhi H (NCTC 901.8394), Staphylococcus epidermis (ATCC 12228), Brucella abortus (RSKK-03026), Micrococcs luteus (ATCC 93419, Bacillus cereus sp., Pseudomonas putida sp. and for antifungal activity against Candida albicans (Y-1200-NIH).
TI  - [Analysis of microorganism species diversity in plant intercropping models in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage].
AB  - The selective culture method and PCR-DGGE technology were applied to analyze the  number and the biodiversity of microorganism species in cells with plant intercropping models and without plants in different seasons in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage. The results showed that the numbers of microorganisms were considerably larger in the cells with plant intercropping models than those without plants, while the number of microorganisms was apparently larger in summer than that in winter in all treatments. Along the three-sequenced treatment cells with plant intercropping models a "low-high-low" changing trend in the numbers of microorganisms in summer. The UPGMA cluster analysis showed that the treatments in the same season were clustered in the same branch except for a few samples in winter and the biodiversity index was consistently higher in summer than that in winter. Five different sequences (DF1-DF5) were obtained through BLAST analysis and retrieval. The closest known origin groups were located as Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Proteus sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, and Burkholderia sp. respectively. The BLASTX comparison test showed that DF1 closely related to the activities of the Mycobacterium bacillus and the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, DF2 functioned as a conservative potential ATP binding protein, DF3 related to the activities of the Bacillus cereus spore, DF4 was involved in catabolism metabolism of microorganism and DF5 played an important role in decomposition of organic matters.
TI  - Identification of a quinone dehydrogenase from a Bacillus sp. involved in the decolourization of the lignin-model dye, Azure B.
AB  - In this study we have investigated the molecular background of the previously reported dye decolourization potential of Bacillus sp. LD003. Strain LD003 was previously isolated on Kraft lignin and was able to decolourize various lignin model dyes. Specifically Azure B (AB) was decolourized efficiently. Proteins possibly involved in AB decolourization were partially purified, fractionated by gel electrophoresis and identified via mass spectrometry. Five candidate enzymes were selected and expressed in Escherichia coli. Of these, only a quinone dehydrogenase was shown to decolourize AB. Thus, this quinone dehydrogenase was identified as an AB decolourizing enzyme of Bacillus sp. LD003.
TI  - Nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the CFU.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  CFU observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (SP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Following the inconsistent results, CFU estimations were undertaken through conventional SP using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. The latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (SS)] yielded higher CFU by 11-120% over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. The adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus pumilus. Plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. Plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% CFU owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. On the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the CFU significantly. Spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while Bacillus spores were less affected. CONCLUSIONS: The study brings out that the way SP is carried out exerts significant effects on CFU influenced by plate conditions. Prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. A mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of SS not involving the spreader is recommended. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial cells and the CFU and recommends an alternate approach of SS to minimize CFU inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.
TI  - The structure of monoacylglycerol lipase from Bacillus sp. H257 reveals unexpected conservation of the cap architecture between bacterial and human enzymes.
AB  - Monoacylglycerol lipases (MGLs) catalyse the hydrolysis of monoacylglycerol into  free fatty acid and glycerol. MGLs have been identified throughout all genera of life and have adopted different substrate specificities depending on their physiological role. In humans, MGL plays an integral part in lipid metabolism affecting energy homeostasis, signalling processes and cancer cell progression. In bacteria, MGLs degrade short-chain monoacylglycerols which are otherwise toxic to the organism. We report the crystal structures of MGL from the bacterium Bacillus sp. H257 (bMGL) in its free form at 1.2A and in complex with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 1.8A resolution. In both structures, bMGL adopts an alpha/beta hydrolase fold with a cap in an open conformation. Access to the active site residues, which were unambiguously identified from the protein structure, is facilitated by two different channels. The larger channel constitutes the highly hydrophobic substrate binding pocket with enough room to accommodate monoacylglycerol. The other channel is rather small and resembles the proposed glycerol exit hole in human MGL. Molecular dynamics simulation of bMGL yielded open and closed states of the entrance channel and the glycerol exit hole. Despite differences in the number of residues, secondary structure elements, and low sequence identity in the cap region, this first structure of a bacterial MGL reveals striking structural conservation of the overall cap architecture in comparison with human MGL. Thus it provides insight into the structural conservation of the cap amongst MGLs throughout evolution and provides a framework for rationalising substrate specificities in each organism.
TI  - Isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  - The bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. The Lactococcus lactis strain PSY2 (GenBank account no. JF703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch Perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria viz. Arthrobacter sp., Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. The biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin PSY2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, Epinephelus diacanthus. The fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of 1,600 AU/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees C. The biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees C to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. The total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. Chemical analysis revealed a significant change (P < 0.05) in the pH value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total methyl amine content in the treated samples. The overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees C while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. The biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees C. Thus, the bacteriocin derived from L. lactis PSY2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.
TI  - Antibacterial anthraquinone derivatives from a sea anemone-derived fungus Nigrospora sp.
AB  - Chemical investigation of a marine-derived fungus Nigrospora sp., isolated from an unidentified sea anemone, yielded two new hydroanthraquinone analogues, 4a-epi-9alpha-methoxydihydrodeoxybostrycin (1) and 10-deoxybostrycin (2), together with seven known anthraquinone derivatives (3-9). The structures of the two new compounds were established through extensive NMR spectroscopy as well as a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu Kalpha radiation. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1-9 and 10 acetyl derivatives (6a, 7a, 8a-8g, 9a) were evaluated in vitro. Compound 6a, the acetylated derivative of 6, exhibited promising activity against Bacillus cereus with an MIC value of 48.8 nM, which was stronger than that of the positive control ciprofloxacin (MIC = 1250 nM). Analysis of the antibacterial screening data for the metabolites and their acetyl derivatives revealed the key structural features required for this activity.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of a novel cycloisomaltooligosaccharide glucanotransferase from Paenibacillus sp. 598K.
AB  - Cycloisomaltooligosaccharide glucanotransferase (CITase; EC 2.4.1.248), a member  of the glycoside hydrolase family 66 (GH66), catalyzes the intramolecular transglucosylation of dextran to produce cycloisomaltooligosaccharides (CIs; cyclodextrans) of varying lengths. Eight CI-producing bacteria have been found; however, CITase from Bacillus circulans T-3040 (CITase-T3040) is the only CI-producing enzyme that has been characterized to date. In this study, we report the gene cloning, enzyme characterization, and analysis of essential Asp and Glu residues of a novel CITase from Paenibacillus sp. 598K (CITase-598K). The cit genes from T-3040 and 598K strains were expressed recombinantly, and the properties of Escherichia coli recombinant enzymes were compared. The two CITases exhibited high primary amino acid sequence identity (67%). The major product of CITase-598K was cycloisomaltoheptaose (CI-7), whereas that of CITase-T3040 was cycloisomaltooctaose (CI-8). Some of the properties of CITase-598K are more favorable for practical use compared with CITase-T3040, i.e., the thermal stability for CITase-598K (</=50 degrees C) was 10 degrees C higher than that for CITase-T3040 (</=40 degrees C); the k(cat)/K(M) value of CITase-598K was approximately two times higher (32.2s(-1)mM(-1)) than that of CITase-T3040 (17.8s(-1)mM(-1)). Isomaltotetraose was the smallest substrate for both CITases. When isomaltoheptaose or smaller substrates were used, a lag time was observed before the intramolecular transglucosylation reaction began. As substrate length increased, the lag time shortened. Catalytically important residues of CITase-598K were predicted to be Asp144, Asp269, and Glu341. These findings will serve as a basis for understanding the reaction mechanism and substrate recognition of GH66 enzymes.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterization of a novel intracellular low-temperature-active xylanase.
AB  - A 990 bp full-length gene (xynAHJ2) encoding a 329- residue polypeptide (XynAHJ2) with a calculated mass of 38.4 kDa was cloned from Bacillus sp. HJ2 harbored in a saline soil. XynAHJ2 showed no signal peptide, distinct amino acid stretches of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 intracellular endoxylanases, and the highest amino acid sequence identity of 65.3% with the identified GH 10 intracellular mesophilic endoxylanase iM-KRICT PX1-Ps from Paenibacillus sp. HPL-001 (ACJ06666). The recombinant enzyme (rXynAHJ2) was expressed in Escherichia coli and displayed the typical characteristics of low-temperatureactive enzyme (exhibiting optimum activity at 35 degrees C, 62% at 20 degrees C, and 38% at 10 degrees C; thermolability at > or =45 degrees C). Compared with the reported GH 10 low-temperature-active endoxylanases, which are all extracellular, rXynAHJ2 showed low amino acid sequence identities (<45%), low homology (different phylogenetic cluster), and difference of structure (decreased amount of total accessible surface area and exposed nonpolar accessible surface area). Compared with the reported GH 10 intracellular endoxylanases, which are all mesophilic and thermophilic, rXynAHJ2 has decreased numbers of arginine residues and salt bridges, and showed resistance to Ni2+, Ca2+, or EDTA at 10 mM final concentration. The above mechanism of structural adaptation for low-temperature activity of intracellular endoxylanase rXynAHJ2 is different from that of GH 10 extracellular low-temperature-active endoxylanases. This is the first report of the molecular and biochemical characterizations of a novel intracellular low-temperatureactive xylanase.
TI  - A novel bioassay for high-throughput screening microorganisms with N-acyl homoserine lactone degrading activity.
AB  - A novel biosensor strain (Escherichia coli ALM403) that responded to N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) was constructed using a luxR-Plux cassette as a regulatory sequence and beta-mannanase as a reporter gene. Dinitrosalicylic acid method was used to detect the response of the sensor strain to N-acyl homoserine lactone. By investigating the response to a range of concentrations of N-beta-oxooctanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (OOHL), it was demonstrated that the expression of mannanase in E. coli ALM403 could be greatly enhanced by OOHL and resulted in an assayable phenotype. A high-throughput screening approach was developed to isolate AHL-degrading microorganisms, and a marine Halomonas sp. S66-4 showing a marked AHL-degrading ability was successfully isolated. In conclusion, the bioassay system provided a simple and efficient approach to isolate AHL-degrading bacteria.
TI  - Immobilized L-aspartate ammonia-lyase from Bacillus sp. YM55-1 as biocatalyst for highly concentrated L-aspartate synthesis.
AB  - L-aspartate ammonia-lyase from Bacillus sp. YM55-1 (AspB, EC 4.3.1.1) catalyzes the reversible conversion of L-aspartate (Asp) into fumarate and ammonia with a high specific activity toward the substrate. AspB was expressed in Escherichia coli and partially purified by heat precipitation and saturation with ammonium sulfate reaching purification factor of 7.7 and specific activity of 334 U/mg of protein. AspB was immobilized by covalent attachment on Eupergit(R) C (epoxy support) and MANA-agarose (amino support), and entrapment in LentiKats(R) (polyvinyl alcohol) with retained activities of 24, 85 and 63 %, respectively. Diffusional limitations were only observed for the enzyme immobilized in LentiKats(R) and were overcome by increasing substrate concentration. Free and immobilized AspB were used for the synthesis of aspartate achieving high product concentration (>/=450 mM) after 24 h of reaction. Immobilized biocatalysts were efficiently reused in 5 cycles of Asp synthesis, keeping over 90 % of activity and reaching over 90 % of conversion in all the cases.
TI  - Iodine from bacterial iodide oxidization by Roseovarius spp. inhibits the growth  of other bacteria.
AB  - Microbial activities in brine, seawater, or estuarine mud are involved in iodine  cycle. To investigate the effects of the microbiologically induced iodine on other bacteria in the environment, a total of 13 bacteria that potentially participated in the iodide-oxidizing process were isolated from water or biofilm at a location containing 131 mug ml(-1) iodide. Three distinct strains were further identified as Roseovarius spp. based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences after being distinguished by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Morphological characteristics of these three Roseovarius spp. varied considerably across and within strains. Iodine production increased with Roseovarius spp. growth when cultured in Marine Broth with 200 mug ml(-1) iodide (I(-)). When 10(6) CFU/ml Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus pumilus were exposed to various concentrations of molecular iodine (I(2)), the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were 0.5, 1.0, and 1.0 mug ml(-1), respectively. However, fivefold increases in the MICs for Roseovarius spp. were obtained. In co-cultured Roseovarius sp. IOB-7 and E. coli in Marine Broth containing iodide (I(-)), the molecular iodine concentration was estimated to be 0.76 mug ml(-1) after 24 h and less than 50 % of E. coli was viable compared to that co-cultured without iodide. The growth inhibition of E. coli was also observed in co-cultures with the two other Roseovarius spp. strains when the molecular iodine concentration was assumed to be 0.52 mug ml(-1).
TI  - Phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using Morinda citrifolia L. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
AB  - Leaf extract of Morinda citrifolia L. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. Synthesized nanoscale (MCAgNPs) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using UV-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. Further SEM, HRTEM analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and SEAD pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the MCAgNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) of synthesized MCAgNPs confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. Further, inhibitory activity of MCAgNPs and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like Eschericia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus and Enterococci sp. The results indicated that the MCAgNPs showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.
TI  - Optimization of a heterologous signal peptide by site-directed mutagenesis for improved secretion of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A heterologous signal peptide (SP) from Bacillus sp. G1 was optimized for secretion of recombinant cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) to the periplasmic and, eventually, extracellular space of Escherichia coli. Eight mutant SPs were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis to improve the secretion of recombinant CGTase. M5 is a mutated SP in which replacement of an isoleucine residue in the h-region to glycine created a helix-breaking or G-turn motif with decreased hydrophobicity. The mutant SP resulted in 110 and 94% increases in periplasmic and extracellular recombinant CGTase, respectively, compared to the wild-type SP at a similar level of cell lysis. The formation of intracellular inclusion bodies was also reduced, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamyde gel electrophoresis, when this mutated SP was used. The addition of as low as 0.08% glycine at the beginning of cell growth improved cell viability of the E. coli host. Secretory production of other proteins, such as mannosidase, also showed similar improvement, as demonstrated by CGTase production, suggesting that the combination of an optimized SP and a suitable chemical additive leads to significant improvements of extracellular recombinant protein production and cell viability. These findings will be valuable for the extracellular production of recombinant proteins in E. coli.
TI  - Active enhancement of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp-israelensis toxins and protein-purification.
AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis sub sp. ilsraelensis de Barjac, that produce insecticidal  protein endotoxins are used for mosquito control. The bacterium produces several Cry and Cytoxins that individually show activity against mosquitoes. A CryllA protein IA848, which corresponds to the first 848 amino acids from N-terminal of CryllA-gene was purified from E. coli by Ni-NTA affinity isolation, Q-Sepharose Fast-Flow chromatography & Super-200 size exclusion chromatography. It was determined using laboratory bioassays that the purified-IA848 protein has good insecticidal competitive binding bioassays show that IA848 does not compete with CryIAb for binding to the brush border membrane vesicles (BBM) of the Aedes aegyptiborer and does not compete with CryIAb at concentrations below 400-fold excess of unlabeled CryIAb for binding to the peritrophic matrix (PM) of the insect. This IA848 proved good competitive in control strategies. CryllA protein purification demonstrate molecular mechanism by which CytIA synergizes or suppresses resistance to toxins by providing a binding site for CryIIAa that resulted in an efficient formation of CryIIAa pre-pore that inserts into membranes and forms ionic pores.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial activities of two Streptomyces isolates from soil in the periphery of Universiti Putra Malaysia.
AB  - This study was to assess the identification and antimicrobial activities of two actinomycete isolates. The two isolates designated as B8 and C2, were isolated from a patch of soil in the peripheral area of Universiti Putra Malaysia by streaking on starch casein agar after standard serial dilution procedures. Their antimicrobial activities were first evaluated against eight clinical laboratory strains namely Bacillus sp., Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis by perpendicular streak method on Mueller Hinton and Tryptic Soy agar. In both media, a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity was observed for both isolates, with B8 against all the test bacteria and C2 against five of them (Bacillus sp., E. coli, Pseudomonas sp., S. aureus and S. epidermidis). Re-assessment against E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. aureus ATCC 25923 strains by similar method showed antibacterial activities by isolate B8 against both ATTC strains while C2 only against S. aureus ATCC 25923. Streptomyces griseus ATCC 10137 was included in the later experiment and showed antibacterial activity against both ATCC strains. Subsequently, the two isolates were identified by PCR/sequencing techniques and phylogenetic analysis to be Streptomyces species (>93% homology based on 16S rRNA and rpoB genes). Characterization on cultural characteristic and viable count at different temperatures (37 masculineC and 28 masculineC), on different microbiological media (AIA, ISP-2, MHA, NA, PDA and TSA), were performed. More morphological features were observed on ISP-2 for both isolates. A higher growth yield was also observed at 28 masculineC in all media but in comparing that between the two isolates, isolate B8 outnumbered C2 at all experimental conditions. The observed variation in cultural traits and growth yield indicate unique properties between the two antibiotic-producing isolates.
TI  - Functional interactions between members of the REPAT family of insect pathogen-induced proteins.
AB  - Studies on the transcriptional response to pathogens in the insect larval gut have shown the regulation of several genes after the infection. Repat (REsponse to PAThogens) genes were first identified in Spodoptera exigua midgut as being up-regulated in response to the exposure to Bacillus thuringiensis toxins and baculovirus. Recently, new members of the REPAT family showed a constitutive up-regulation in a B. thuringiensis-resistant population. Based on a yeast two-hybrid screening, we have detected the interaction of REPAT1 with other members of the REPAT family, leading to the discovery of a new member: REPAT8. The functional role of this interaction was shown by following the changes of the subcellular localization of REPAT1 in the presence of REPAT8. REPAT1 alone was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, while the presence of REPAT8 led to the migration of REPAT1 to the nucleus. Finally, analysis of the expression pattern of eight REPAT members has shown that B. thuringiensis-related treatments (Cry1Ca toxin, Xentari product and an acrystalliferous strain) induced a general up-regulation of repat genes, especially of repat2. In contrast, no significant effect was detected after treatment with Escherichia coli or Enterococcus sp., or by the presence of microbiota in the midgut. The results suggest that the different repat genes play different roles in response to pathogens.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of a 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase from Bacillus sp. JF8 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase plays an important role in the degradation  of polychlorinated biphenyls. The gene (BsbphCI) encoding a 2,3-DHBP dioxygenase from Bacillus sp. JF8 is 960 bp. We synthesized a 960 bp BsbphCI gene encoding a 2,3-DHBP dioxygenase derived from Bacillus sp. JF8 and expressed it in Escherichiacoli. The recombinant protein was about 36 kDa, confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of the purified protein was about 1.8 mg/mL. With 2,3-DHBP as a substrate, the optimal temperature for enzyme activity at pH 8.5 was 50 degrees C. The optimal pH for the 2,3-DHBP dioxygenase was 8.5. The enzyme retained 33% activity after heating at 60 degrees C for 60 min. We found that Cu(2+), K(+), Zn(2+), Mg(2+), Ni(2+), Co(2+), and Cd(2+) activated the enzyme. However, Ca(2+), Fe(2+), Li(+), and Cr(3+) inhibited it. Enzyme activity was reduced by exposure to H(2)O(2), SDS, and KI. The results of HPLC indicated that the transgenic E. coli strain with the BsbphCI gene degraded 2,3-DHBP more quickly than the wild type strain.
TI  - Preparation of magnetic nanoparticles and their use for immobilization of C-terminally lysine-tagged Bacillus sp. TS-23 alpha-amylase.
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to synthesize the adipic acid-modified magnetic nanoparticles for the efficient immobilization of C-terminally lysine-tagged alpha-amylase (BACDeltaNC-Lys(7)) from thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain TS-23. The carboxylated magnetic nanoparticles were prepared by the simple co-precipitation of Fe(3)(+)/Fe(2)(+) in aqueous medium and then subsequently modified with adipic acid. Transmission electron microscopy micrographs showed that the carboxylated magnetic nanoparticles remained discrete and had no significant change in size after the binding of BACDeltaNC-Lys(7). Free enzyme was active in the temperature range of 45-70 degrees C and had an optimum of 60 degrees C, whereas the thermal stability of BACDeltaNC-Lys(7) was improved as a result of immobilization. The immobilized BACDeltaNC-Lys(7) could be recycled 20 times without a significant loss of the amylase activity and had a better stability during storage with respect to free enzyme. Taken together, the magnetic nanoparticles coated with this functional moiety can be a versatile platform for the effective manipulation of various kinds of engineered proteins.
TI  - Highly efficient decolorization of Malachite Green by a novel Micrococcus sp. strain BD15.
AB  - PURPOSE: Malachite Green (MG) is used for a variety of applications but is also known to be carcinogenic and mutagenic. In this study, a novel Micrococcus sp. (strain BD15) was observed to efficiently decolorize MG. The purposes of this study were to explore the optimal conditions for decolorization and to evaluate the potential use of this strain for MG decolorization. METHODS: Optical microscope and UV-visible analyses were carried out to determine whether the decolorization was due to biosorption or biodegradation. A Plackett-Burman design was employed to investigate the effect of various parameters on decolorization, and response surface methodology was then used to explore the optimal decolorization conditions. Kinetics analysis and antimicrobial activity tests were also performed. RESULTS: The results indicated that the decolorization by the strain was mainly due to biodegradation. Concentrations of MG, urea, and yeast extract and inoculum size had significantly positive effects on MG decolorization, while concentrations of CuCl(2) and MgCl(2), and temperature had significantly negative effects. The interaction between different parameters could significantly affect decolorization, and the optimal conditions for decolorization were 1.0 g/L urea, 0.9 g/L yeast extract, 100 mg/L MG, 0.1 g/L inoculums (dry weight), and incubation at 25.2 degrees C. Under the optimal conditions, 96.9% of MG was removed by the strain within 1 h, which represents highly efficient microbial decolorization. Moreover, the kinetic data for decolorization fit a second-order model well, and the strain showed a good MG detoxification capability. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, we propose Micrococcus sp. strain BD15 as an excellent candidate strain for MG removal from wastewater.
TI  - Orally administered thermostable N-acyl homoserine lactonase from Bacillus sp. strain AI96 attenuates Aeromonas hydrophila infection in zebrafish.
AB  - N-Acylated homoserine lactone (AHL) lactonases are capable of degrading signal molecules involved in bacterial quorum sensing and therefore represent a new approach to control bacterial infection. Here a gene responsible for the AHL lactonase activity of Bacillus sp. strain AI96, 753 bp in length, was cloned and then expressed in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence of Bacillus sp. AI96 AiiA (AiiA(AI96)) is most similar to those of other Bacillus sp. AHL lactonases (~80% sequence identity) and was consequently categorized as a member of the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily. AiiA(AI96) maintains ~100% of its activity at 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C at pH 8.0, and it is very stable at 70 degrees C at pH 8.0 for at least 1 h; no other Bacillus AHL lactonase has been found to be stable under these conditions. AiiA(AI96) resists digestion by proteases and carp intestinal juice, and it has broad-spectrum substrate specificity. The supplementation of AiiA(AI96) into fish feed by oral administration significantly attenuated Aeromonas hydrophila infection in zebrafish. This is the first report of the oral administration of an AHL lactonase for the efficient control of A. hydrophila.
TI  - Chromophenazines from the terrestrial Streptomyces sp. Ank 315.
AB  - The new chromophenazines A-F [9-methyl-5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-5H-benzo[a]phenazin-7-one (1a), 9-methyl-5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-7-oxo-5,7-dihydrobenzo[a]phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (1b), 5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-7-oxo-5,7-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxamide (2), 3-benzoyl-5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5a), 3,7-dibenzoyl-5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5b), and 3,7-dibenzoyl-5-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)-5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxamide (5c)], together with phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, 1-phenazinecarboxamide, 1-phenazinol, tryptophol, and anthranilic acid, were isolated from Streptomyces sp. Ank 315. The structures of the new compounds were established on the basis of spectroscopic data, 1D NOE, 2D NMR, and ESIMS measurements and comparison with literature values.
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - Chemical constituents of the methanolic extract of leaves of Leiothrix spiralis Ruhland and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Chemical fractionation of the methanolic extract of leaves of Leiothrix spiralis  Ruhland afforded the flavonoids luteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), 7-methoxyluteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2), 7-methoxyluteolin-8-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3), 4'-methoxyluteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), and 6-hydroxy-7-methoxyluteolin (5), and the xanthones 8-carboxymethyl-1,5,6-trihydroxy-3-methoxyxanthone (6), 8-carboxy-methyl-1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (7). Methanolic extract, fractions, and isolated compounds of the leaves of L. spiralis were assayed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella setubal and Helicobacter pylori) and fungi (the yeasts Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis). We observed the best minimum inhibitory concentration values for the methanolic extract against Candida parapsilosis, for the fraction 5 + 6 against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and compound 7 against all tested Candida strains. The methanolic extract contents suggest that this species may be a promising source of compounds to produce natural phytomedicines.
TI  - Cyclic ether-containing macrolactins, antimicrobial 24-membered isomeric macrolactones from a marine Bacillus sp.
AB  - Bioassay-guided isolation of bioactive metabolites from the ethyl acetate extract of a marine Bacillus sp. fermentation broth has led to the discovery of three new 24-membered macrolactones, macrolactins 1-3, which contain an oxetane, an epoxide, and a tetrahydropyran ring, respectively. The configurations of 1-3 were assigned by a combination of coupling constants, ROESY data analysis, and application of the modified Mosher's method. Compounds 1-3 showed in vitro antimicrobial activity.
TI  - First report of a bifunctional chitinase/lysozyme produced by Bacillus pumilus SG2.
AB  - Bacillus pumilus SG2 isolated from high salinity ecosystem in Iran produces two chitinases (ChiS and ChiL) and secretes them into the medium. In this study, chiS and chiL genes were cloned in pQE-30 expression vector and were expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli strain M15. The recombinant proteins were purified using Ni-NTA column. The optimum pH and optimum temperature for enzyme activity of ChiS were pH 6, 50 degrees C; those of ChiL were pH 6.5, 40 degrees C. The purified chitinases showed antifungal activity against Fusarium graminearum, Rhizoctonia solani, Magnaporthe grisea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Trichoderma reesei, Botrytis cinerea and Bipolaris sp. Moreover, purified ChiS was identified as chitinase/lysozyme, which are capable of degrading the chitin component of fungal cell walls and the peptidoglycan component of cell walls with many kinds of bacteria (Xanthomonas translucens pv. hordei, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, Bacillus licheniformis, E. coli C600, E. coli TOP10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida). Strong homology was found between the three-dimensional structures of ChiS and a chitinase/lysozyme from Bacillus circulans WL-12. This is the first report of a bifunctional chitinase/lysozyme from B. pumilus.
TI  - Characterization of a novel biosurfactant produced by Staphylococcus sp. strain 1E with potential application on hydrocarbon bioremediation.
AB  - A biosurfactant-producing bacterium (Staphylococcus sp. strain 1E) was isolated from an Algerian crude oil contaminated soil. Biosurfactant production was tested with different carbon sources using the surface tension measurement and the oil displacement test. Olive oil produced the highest reduction in surface tension (25.9 dynes cm(-1)). Crude oil presented the best substrate for 1E biosurfactant emulsification activity. The biosurfactant produced by strain 1E reduced the growth medium surface tension below 30 dynes cm(-1). This reduction was also obtained in cell-free filtrates. Biosurfactant produced by strain 1E showed stability in a wide range of pH (from 2 to 12), temperature (from 4 to 55 degrees C) and salinity (from 0 to 300 g l(-1)) variations. The biosurfactant produced by strain 1E belonged to lipopeptide group and also constituted an antibacterial activity againt the pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. Phenanthrene solubility in water was enhanced by biosurfactant addition. Our results suggest that the 1E biosurfactant has interesting properties for its application in bioremediation of hydrocarbons contaminated sites.
TI  - A new sesquiterpene from endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp.
AB  - A fungal strain named YLF-14 was isolated from the leaf of Altingia yunnunensis.  Based on the sequence at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the strain was identified as an Aspergillus sp.. A new sesquiterpene 5beta,8abeta-dimethyl-3,4,4abeta,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1,2,5alpha-trime thanol (1) and a known compound 12-N-methylcyclo-(L-tryptophyl-L-phenylalanyl) (2) were isolated from the culture of this strain. Bioassay experiments showed that the two compounds had no obvious effect on the growth of tested bacteria and nematodes.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Mutations suppressing the loss of DegQ function in Bacillus subtilis (natto) poly-gamma-glutamate synthesis.
AB  - The degQ gene of Bacillus subtilis (natto), encoding a small peptide of 46 amino  acids, is essential for the synthesis of extracellular poly-gamma-glutamate (gammaPGA). To elucidate the role of DegQ in gammaPGA synthesis, we knocked out the degQ gene in Bacillus subtilis (natto) and screened for suppressor mutations that restored gammaPGA synthesis in the absence of DegQ. Suppressor mutations were found in degS, the receptor kinase gene of the DegS-DegU two-component system. Recombinant DegS-His(6) mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli cells and subjected to an in vitro phosphorylation assay. Compared with the wild type, mutant DegS-His(6) proteins showed higher levels of autophosphorylation (R208Q, M195I, L248F, and D250N), reduced autodephosphorylation (D250N), reduced phosphatase activity toward DegU, or a reduced ability to stimulate the autodephosphorylation activity of DegU (R208Q, D249G, M195I, L248F, and D250N) and stabilized DegU in the phosphorylated form. These mutant DegS proteins mimic the effect of DegQ on wild-type DegSU in vitro. Interestingly, DegQ stabilizes phosphorylated DegS only in the presence of DegU, indicating a complex interaction of these three proteins.
TI  - Synthesis, stereochemistry and in vitro antimicrobial evaluation of novel 2-[(2,4-diaryl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ylidene)hydrazono]-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydro thiazoles.
AB  - 2-[(2,4-Diaryl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ylidene)hydrazono]-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydro thiazoles (3a-3k) have been synthesized by the cyclization of 2-[(2,4-diaryl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one thiosemicarbazones with phenacyl bromide and characterized by analytical (melting point and elemental analysis) and spectral (IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, D(2)O exchange, NOESY and mass) techniques. The novel Hantzsch products (3a-3k) were screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities against some selected microorganisms. Structure activity relationship (SAR) for the reported compounds was studied by comparing their MIC values with standard drugs (Streptomycin and Amphotericin B). The results show that 3e against Escherichia coli and Cryptococcus neoformans3i against Bacillus Subtilis, 3b against Aspergillus flavus, and 3k against Rhizopus sp. were found to show significant growth inhibition.
TI  - Anti-biofilm activity of an exopolysaccharide from a sponge-associated strain of  Bacillus licheniformis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary metabolites ranging from furanone to exo-polysaccharides have been suggested to have anti-biofilm activity in various recent studies. Among these, Escherichia coli group II capsular polysaccharides were shown to inhibit biofilm formation of a wide range of organisms and more recently marine Vibrio sp. were found to secrete complex exopolysaccharides having the potential for broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition and disruption. RESULTS: In this study we report that a newly identified ca. 1800 kDa polysaccharide having simple monomeric units of alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->2)-glycerol-phosphate exerts an anti-biofilm activity against a number of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains without bactericidal effects. This polysaccharide was extracted from a Bacillus licheniformis strain associated with the marine organism Spongia officinalis. The mechanism of action of this compound is most likely independent from quorum sensing, as its structure is unrelated to any of the so far known quorum sensing molecules. In our experiments we also found that treatment of abiotic surfaces with our polysaccharide reduced the initial adhesion and biofilm development of strains such as Escherichia coli PHL628 and Pseudomonas fluorescens. CONCLUSION: The polysaccharide isolated from sponge-associated B. licheniformis has several features that provide a tool for better exploration of novel anti-biofilm compounds. Inhibiting biofilm formation of a wide range of bacteria without affecting their growth appears to represent a special feature of the polysaccharide described in this report. Further research on such surface-active compounds might help developing new classes of anti-biofilm molecules with broad spectrum activity and more in general will allow exploring of new functions for bacterial polysaccharides in the environment.
TI  - Diverse metabolic profiles of a Streptomyces strain isolated from a hyper-arid environment.
AB  - The metabolic profile of Streptomyces sp. strain C34, isolated from the Chilean hyper-arid Atacama Desert soil, is dependent on the culture media used for its growth. The application of an OSMAC approach on this strain using a range of cultivation media resulted in the isolation and identification of three new compounds from the rare class of 22-membered macrolactone polyketides, named chaxalactins A-C (1-3). In addition, the known compounds deferroxamine E (4), hygromycin A (5), and 5''-dihydrohygromycin A (6) were detected. The isolated compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and accurate mass spectrometric analysis. Compounds 1-3 displayed strong activity against Gram-positive but weak activity Gram-negative strains tested.
TI  - Characterization of a thermally stable and organic solvent-adaptative NAD+ -dependent formate dehydrogenase from Bacillus sp. F1.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize a robust NAD(+) -dependent formate dehydrogenase firstly obtained from a nonmethylotroph, Bacillus sp. F1. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Bacillus sp. F1 NAD(+) -dependent formate dehydrogenase (BacFDH) gene was cloned by TAIL-PCR and heterologous expressed in Escherichia coli. BacFDH was stable at temperatures below 55 degrees C, and the half-life at 60 degrees C was determined as 52.9 min. This enzyme also showed a broad pH stability and retained more than 80% of the activities after incubating in buffers with different pH ranging from 4.5 to 10.5 for 1 h. The activity of BacFDH was significantly enhanced by some metal ions. Moreover, BacFDH exhibited high tolerance to 20% dimethyl sulfoxide, 60% acetone, 10% methanol, 20% ethanol, 60% isopropanol and 20% n-hexane. Like other FDHs, BacFDH displayed strict substrate specificity for formate. CONCLUSION: We isolated a robust formate dehydrogenase, designated as BacFDH, which showed excellent thermal stability, organic solvent stability and a broad pH stability. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The multi-aspect stability makes BacFDH a competitive candidate for coenzyme regeneration in practical applications of chiral chemicals and pharmaceuticals synthesis with a relatively low cost, especially for the catalysis performed in extreme pH conditions and organic solvents.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new 1-[(tetrazol-5-yl)methyl] indole derivatives, their 1,2,4-triazole thioglycosides and acyclic analogs.
AB  - New 1-[(tetrazol-5-yl)methyl]indole derivatives, their acyclic nucleoside analogs and the corresponding glycoside derivatives were synthesized. Furthermore, the [)(1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)methyl])-2H-tetrazole derivative as well as the corresponding thioglucoside were prepared. The synthesized compounds were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Aspergillus Niger, Penicillium sp, Candida albican, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lacti, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., and streptomyces sp. Compounds 3, 5 and 19b exhibited potent antibacterial activity and compounds 4, 5 and 10 exhibited high activities against the tested fungi compared with fusidic acid.
TI  - Post-liberation cleavage of signal peptides is catalyzed by the site-2 protease (S2P) in bacteria.
AB  - A signal peptide (SP) is cleaved off from presecretory proteins by signal peptidase during or immediately after insertion into the membrane. In metazoan cells, the cleaved SP then receives proteolysis by signal peptide peptidase, an intramembrane-cleaving protease (I-CLiP). However, bacteria lack any signal peptide peptidase member I-CLiP, and little is known about the metabolic fate of bacterial SPs. Here we show that Escherichia coli RseP, an site-2 protease (S2P) family I-CLiP, introduces a cleavage into SPs after their signal peptidase-mediated liberation from preproteins. A Bacillus subtilis S2P protease, RasP, is also shown to be involved in SP cleavage. These results uncover a physiological role of bacterial S2P proteases and update the basic knowledge about the fate of signal peptides in bacterial cells.
TI  - Hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  - In order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the Greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). In all cold meat preparations Clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Clostridium sp lec(-), as well as Lactobacillus, Bacillus sp. and Salmonella sp. were recovered. For instance Bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. L. monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter lari were absent. Differences in the occurrence of S. aureus, Salmonella sp., E. coli and spore forms of C. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). Antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. A multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. Antibiotics commonly used for therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. Systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.
TI  - Identification of the genes involved in 1-deoxynojirimycin synthesis in Bacillus  subtilis MORI 3K-85.
AB  - 1-Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), a D-glucose analogue with a nitrogen atom substituting  for the ring oxygen, is a strong inhibitor of intestinal alpha-glucosidase. DNJ has several promising biological activities, including its antidiabetic, antitumor, and antiviral activities. Nevertheless, only limited amounts of DNJ are available because it can only be extracted from some higher plants, including the mulberry tree, or purified from the culture broth of several types of soil bacteria, such as Streptomyces sp. and Bacillus sp. In our previous study, a DNJ-producing bacterium, Bacillus subtilis MORI, was isolated from the traditional Korean fermented food Chungkookjang. In the present study, we report the identification of the DNJ biosynthetic genes in B. subtilis MORI 3K-85 strain, a DNJ-overproducing derivate of the B. subtilis MORI strain generated by gamma-irradiation, xhe genomic DNA library of B. subtilis MORI 3K-85 was constructed in Escherichia coli, and clones showing alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity were selected. After DNA sequencing and a series of subcloning, we were able to identify a putative Operon which consists of gabT1, yktc1, and gutB1 genes predicted to encode putative transaminase, phosphatase, and oxidoreductase, respectively. When a recombinant plasmid containing this Operon sequence was transformed into an E. coli strain, the resulting transformant was able to produce DNJ into the culture medium. Our results indicate that the gabT1, yktc1, and gutB1 genes are involved in the DNJ biosynthetic pathway in B. subtilis MORI, suggesting the possibility of employing these genes to establish a large-scale microbial DNJ overproduction system through genetic engineering and process optimization.
TI  - Ieodomycins A-D, antimicrobial fatty acids from a marine Bacillus sp.
AB  - Bioassay-guided isolation of the EtOAc extract of a marine Bacillus sp., cultured in modified Bennett's broth medium, yielded four new antimicrobial fatty acids, named ieodomycins A-D. The planar structures of these new compounds were determined by extensive 1D and 2D NMR and HRESIMS spectroscopic data analysis. Their absolute configurations were elucidated by modified Mosher's method and literature data review. All four new compounds demonstrated antimicrobial activities in vitro.
TI  - Involvement of propeptides in formation of catalytically active metalloproteinase from Thermoactinomyces sp.
AB  - The metalloproteinase from Thermoactinomyces sp. 27a (Mpr) represents secretory thermolysin-like metalloproteinases of the M4 family. The Thermoactinomyces enzyme is synthesized as a precursor consisting of a signal peptide, N-terminal propeptide, mature region, and C-terminal propeptide. The functional molecule lacks the signal peptide, N-terminal propeptide, and C-terminal propeptide, which indicates the processing of these regions. Until now, it remained unclear if the N-terminal propeptide is involved in the formation and functioning of Mpr, and the role of the C-terminal propeptide was also unclear. In this work, a Bacillus subtilis AJ73 strain expressing Mpr without the C-terminal propeptide- encoding region being involved has been obtained. The absence of the Mpr C-terminal propeptide had no significant effect on the formation of the functional molecule and did not interfere with the protease secretion in B. subtilis AJ73 cells. Strains producing the N-terminal propeptide, mature region, and mature region covalently bound to the N-terminal propeptide were generated from Escherichia coli BL-21(DE3) cells. Functionally active Mpr forms could be produced only in the presence of the N-terminal propeptide, either covalently bound to the mature region (in cis) or as a separate molecule (in trans). Thus, the Mpr three-dimensional structure is formed according to the propeptide-assisted mechanism with no requirement of a covalent bond between the N-terminal propeptide and mature region. Moreover, Mpr variants generated in cis and in trans differed in their specificity for certain synthetic substrates.
TI  - Extending the scope of site-specific cysteine bioconjugation by appending a prelabeled cysteine tag to proteins using protein trans-splicing.
AB  - Incorporating synthetic probes site-specifically into proteins is of central interest in several areas of biotechnology and protein chemistry. Bioconjugation techniques provide a simple and effective means of chemically modifying a protein. In particular, covalent chemical modifications of cysteine residues belong to one of the most important reactions due to the unique reactivity of its thiol moiety and the relatively low abundance of this amino acid in proteins. However, such types of modifications cannot be performed in a regioselective fashion when one or more additional cysteines are present. To address this limitation, we have developed an approach where a short cysteine-containing tag (Cys-Tag) fused to one part of a split intein and modified at its sulfhydryl group can be used to label proteins by trans-splicing with a protein of interest (POI) fused to the other half of the split intein. In this way, it is possible to selectively label a protein containing multiple cysteines. The artificially split Mycobacterium xenopi GyrA intein and the Synechocystis sp. DnaB intein were highly suitable for this purpose and were successfully used for the labeling of several proteins. This approach enables a simple route for labeling proteins by site-specific cysteine bioconjugation with any one of several commercially available cysteine-modifying probes.
TI  - Highly stereoselective reduction of prochiral ketones by a bacterial reductase coupled with cofactor regeneration.
AB  - A carbonyl reductase gene (yueD) from Bacillus sp. ECU0013 was heterologously overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the encoded protein (BYueD) was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The NADPH-dependent reductase showed a broad substrate spectrum towards different aromatic ketones, and alpha- and beta-ketoesters. Although the enantioselectivity was high to moderate for the reduction of alpha-ketoesters, all the tested beta-ketoesters and aromatic ketones were reduced to the corresponding chiral alcohols in enantiomerically pure forms. Furthermore, the practical applicability of this enzyme was evaluated for the reduction of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (1a). Using Escherichia coli cells coexpressing BYueD and glucose dehydrogenase, 215 g L(-1) (1.3 M) of 1a was stoichiometrically converted to ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ((R)-1b) in an aqueous-toluene biphasic system by using a substrate fed-batch strategy, resulting in an overall hydroxyl product yield of 91.7% with enantiomeric purity of 99.6% ee.
TI  - cis-antisense RNA, another level of gene regulation in bacteria.
AB  - A substantial amount of antisense transcription is a hallmark of gene expression  in eukaryotes. However, antisense transcription was first demonstrated in bacteria almost 50 years ago. The transcriptomes of bacteria as different as Helicobacter pylori, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Sinorhizobium meliloti, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Vibrio cholerae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Pseudomonas syringae, and Staphylococcus aureus have now been reported to contain antisense RNA (asRNA) transcripts for a high percentage of genes. Bacterial asRNAs share functional similarities with trans-acting regulatory RNAs, but in addition, they use their own distinct mechanisms. Among their confirmed functional roles are transcription termination, codegradation, control of translation, transcriptional interference, and enhanced stability of their respective target transcripts. Here, we review recent publications indicating that asRNAs occur as frequently in simple unicellular bacteria as they do in higher organisms, and we provide a comprehensive overview of the experimentally confirmed characteristics of asRNA actions and intimately linked quantitative aspects. Emerging functional data suggest that asRNAs in bacteria mediate a plethora of effects and are involved in far more processes than were previously anticipated. Thus, the functional impact of asRNAs should be considered when developing new strategies against pathogenic bacteria and when optimizing bacterial strains for biotechnology.
TI  - Efficient E. coli expression systems for the production of recombinant beta-mannanases and other bacterial extracellular enzymes.
AB  - Two Escherichia coli expression systems based on T7 RNA polymerase promoter (pET  system) and tac promoter (pFLAG system) have been used for the production and secretion of recombinant beta-mannanases from Bacillus sp. Both E. coli OmpA signal peptide and native Bacillus signal peptide could be used efficiently for the secretion of recombinant enzymes into periplasmic space and culture media. The genes could be induced for over-expression with 0.1-1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when the OD 600 of the culture broth reached 0.6-1.5. The recombinant enzymes could be harvested from whole cell lysate, perimplasmic extract, or culture broth after induction for 4-20 hours. Since the enzyme is C-terminally tagged with hexahistidine, the recombinant enzymes could be conveniently purified to apparent homogeneity by one-step immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-NTA resins. The characteristics of purified recombinant beta-mannanases from B. licheniformis and B. subtilis, which share 78% amino acid identity, are slightly different. These systems should be applicable for the production of various recombinant bacterial extracellular enzymes.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Isolation of microbial pathogens of subclinical mastitis from raw sheep's milk of Epirus (Greece) and their role in its hygiene.
AB  - The natural raw milk microflora is a factor that expresses its sensorial characteristics. The microbial charge into the mammary gland of healthy animal is low and the application of right and healthy conditions during milking and cheese making procedure, prevents from contaminating as well as maintains the natural microflora in order to lend the particular characteristics of milk. The purpose of the present project was the study of the Total Viable Count (T.V.C.) and the count of total psychrotropic bacteria of raw sheep milk from Boutsiko and Karamaniko breeds, collected from healthy animals, as well as the isolation, identification and enumeration of pathogenic bacteria related with the hygiene and the quality of raw sheep milk (with a particular interest in bacteria that may cause human infection). During the experiment we examined two hundred forty (240) samples of raw sheep milk. In these samples a) Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens (vegetative cells and spores) and Bacillus sp. were isolated and identified b) the Total Viable Count and the total number of psychrotropic bacteria were also specified. The sampling, the preparation of samples and decimal dilutions were based on international methods. The Total viable count was determined using the standard methods of the American Public Health Association, 2002. The total number of psychrotropic bacteria was determined using APHA 1976, 1978 rules. The identification of the bacteria was carried out according to the Bergey's manual. Microscopic examination of Gram stained cells, catalase, oxidase and biochemical tests were performed when necessary to further identify. From the 240 milk samples tested, only 5% were E. coli positive, with mean counts ranged from 2 x 10(3) to 2.4 x 10(4) cfu/ml. S. aureus was isolated from 24% of the samples and the mean count per ml was ranged from <10 to 3.4 x 10(2). Meanwhile, Bacillus spp. was also detected in 29% samples. Vegetative forms and spores of C. perfringens were detected in 13% and 63% of the samples respectively. However, microbiological analyses revealed the presence of a small number of selected pathogens in milk samples such as Salmonella, which was only detected in 5% of the samples. Listeria sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Vibrio cholerae were never found. From the experimental results, the Total Viable Count from raw sheep milk samples, fulfils the microbiological criteria of EU Legislation in a percentage of approximately 97%.
TI  - Bacillus sp. CDB3 isolated from cattle dip-sites possesses two ars gene clusters.
AB  - Contamination of soil and water by arsenic is a global problem. In Australia, the dipping of cattle in arsenic-containing solution to control cattle ticks in last centenary has left many sites heavily contaminated with arsenic and other toxicants. We had previously isolated five soil bacterial strains (CDB1-5) highly resistant to arsenic. To understand the resistance mechanism, molecular studies have been carried out. Two chromosome-encoded arsenic resistance (ars) gene clusters have been cloned from CDB3 (Bacillus sp.). They both function in Escherichia coli and cluster 1 exerts a much higher resistance to the toxic metalloid. Cluster 2 is smaller possessing four open reading frames (ORFs) arsRorf2BC, similar to that identified in Bacillus subtilis Skin element. Among the eight ORFs in cluster 1 five are analogs of common ars genes found in other bacteria, however, organized in a unique order arsRBCDA instead of arsRDABC. Three other putative genes are located directly downstream and designated as arsTIP based on the homologies of their theoretical translation sequences respectively to thioredoxin reductases, iron-sulphur cluster proteins and protein phosphatases. The latter two are novel of any known ars operons. The arsD gene from Bacillus species was cloned for the first time and the predict protein differs from the well studied E. coli ArsD by lacking two pairs of C-terminal cysteine residues. Its functional involvement in arsenic resistance has been confirmed by a deletion experiment. There exists also an inverted repeat in the intergenic region between arsC and arsD implying some unknown transcription regulation.
TI  - Microbial ecology of fish species ongrowing in Greek sea farms and their watery environment.
AB  - The present study focuses on the bacteriological profile of both watery ecosystem and fishes from different North and Central West Greek fish-farms ongrowing euryhaline fish species. The natural microflora of the fish and the water of their ongrowing units in selected farms were studied for a period of 20 months. The analyzed samples were mainly sea bream (Sparus aurata) 61.3% and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) 24%. In most of the watery ecosystems coming from the different sampling areas, total and fecal coliforms as well as total and fecal streptococci were abundant in all water samples. Enterococcus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas were present at a level of 3 logs cfu/100 ml. The anaerobic Clostridium perfringens was found in vegetative (21.3%) and spore forms (13.3%). It is of interest to note that pathogens as Pasteurella piscicida and Vibrio anguillarum were isolated only in a small number of samples. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 4% of the samples, other Staphylococcus sp. in 29.3%, E. coli in 30.7%, Salmonella sp. in 1.3%, Pseudomonas sp. in 13.3%, Clostridia lec(-) in 49.3%, Bacillus sp. in 38.7%, Vibrio sp. in 18.7%, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus sp. in 36% kappaalphaiota 29.3% respectively. Vegetative forms of C. perfringens were detected in 22.7%. Although, our results showed no significant correlations between the sea water and fish microflora, more focus on this bipolar interacting system should be necessary in order to avoid any possible disturbance in the balance of the healthy farming ecosystem with the host organisms.
TI  - Effectiveness of 2% peracetic acid for the disinfection of gutta-percha cones.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% peracetic acid for  the disinfection of gutta-percha cones contaminated in vitro with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans and Bacillus subtilus (in spore form). Two hundred and twenty-five gutta-percha cones were contaminated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The cones were divided into 10 experimental groups (n = 15), according to the microorganism tested and disinfection testing times. The disinfection procedure consisted of immersing each cone in a plastic tube containing the substance. The specimens remained in contact with the substance for 1 or 2.5 minutes. Afterwards, each cone was transferred to a 10% sodium thiosulphate solution (Na(2)S(2)O(3)) to neutralize the disinfectant. Microbial biofilms adhering to the cones were dispersed by agitation. Aliquots of 0.1 ml of the suspensions obtained were plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar, or brain and heart infusion agar, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The results were expressed in colony forming units (CFU/ml) and the data were submitted to the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (level of significance at 0.05). A significant reduction was observed, after 1 minute of exposure, in the test solution for C. albicans (p = 0.0190), S. aureus (p = 0.0001), S. mutans (p = 0.0001), B. subtilis (p = 0.0001), and E. coli (p = 0.0001). After 2.5 minutes of exposure, 100% of the microbial inocula were eliminated. It was concluded that the 2% peracetic acid solution was effective against the biofilms of the tested microorganisms on gutta-percha cones at 1 minute of exposure.
TI  - Scalarane sesterterpenes from the sponge Hyatella sp.
AB  - Five new sesterterpenes (7-11) along with six known compounds (1-6) were isolated from the sponge Hyatella sp., collected off the coast of Soheuksan-do, Korea. Spectroscopic analyses revealed these compounds as scalarane sesterterpenes with oxidized furan moieties (7-10) and a corresponding lactam (11). The compounds exhibited moderate cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and weak inhibitory activity against isocitrate lyase.
TI  - Akara Ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  - Akara Ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP). The akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. There was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, Shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. Microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. The critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. It may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. Akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of HACCP was not contaminated. Several bacterial isolates, namely; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two to nine. Seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.
TI  - Chemical, physical and microbiological changes during composting of the water hyacinth.
AB  - An investigation of the physical, chemical and microbial population changes that  occurred during the composting of water hyacinth was carried out. After 11 weeks of composting, the compost turned black, had decomposed and had no smell. The pH was 7 and the highest temperature reached, of 40 degrees C occurred in the first week. The initial carbon/nitrogen ratio was 17.61 and this increased to 18.12 by the end of the composting. The coliform population declined greatly from 8.11 to 5.85 MPN (log)/g and fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli were not detected in the final product. Bacteria were the dominant microbes in the compost followed by actinomycetes and fungi. Mesophillic microorganisms were present in higher numbers than thermophillic microorganisms throughout the composting. The highest cellulase and xylanase activities in the compost of 6.67 and 10.24 U/kg DW, respectively were detected in the second week which was related to the temperature. Bacillus sp. strain B4 was isolated and investigated for cellulase and xylanase using agro-industrial residues as substrates during Solid-State Fermentation (SSF) processes. Corncob and rice straw were good substrates for the production of the enzymes with a maximum cellulase of 1.19 U/gDW and xylanase activity of 2.54 U/g DW, respectively. The activities of both enzymes were stable and maximum at 50 degrees C. This study indicated that agro-industrial residues should be mixed with water hyacinth for composting to facilitate the development of a thermophilic phase during the composting process and to improve the product. Bacillus sp. strain B4 can be used as a starter strain.
TI  - Synthesis, stereochemistry, antimicrobial evaluation and QSAR studies of 2,6-diaryltetrahydropyran-4-one thiosemicarbazones.
AB  - A series of 2,6-diaryltetrahydropyran-4-one thiosemicarbazones (11-27) were synthesized and characterized for evaluation of potential antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumonia and antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Rhizopus sp., Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus were evaluated. Compounds 21 and 22 showed maximum inhibition potency at low concentration (6.25 mug/ml) against P. aeruginosa. For antifungal activity, 20 and 21 were effective against C. neoformans and 22-24 against C. albicans at minimum concentration. Further, the results of QSAR studies of these synthesized compounds indicated the importance of weakly polar component of surface area, hydrophobicity and ionization potential parameters in defining their antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Characterisation of two quorum sensing systems in the endophytic Serratia plymuthica strain G3: differential control of motility and biofilm formation according to life-style.
AB  - BACKGROUND: N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-based quorum sensing (QS) systems have been described in many plant-associated Gram-negative bacteria to control certain beneficial phenotypic traits, such as production of biocontrol factors and plant growth promotion. However, the role of AHL-mediated signalling in the endophytic strains of plant-associated Serratia is still poorly understood. An endophytic Serratia sp. G3 with biocontrol potential and high levels of AHL signal production was isolated from the stems of wheat and the role of QS in this isolate was determined. RESULTS: Strain G3 classified as Serratia plymuthica based on 16S rRNA was subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Using primers to conserved sequences of luxIR homologues from the Serratia genus, splIR and spsIR from the chromosome of strain G3 were cloned and sequenced. AHL profiles from strain G3 and Escherichia coli DH5alpha expressing splI or spsI from recombinant plasmids were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. This revealed that the most abundant AHL signals produced by SplI in E. coli were N-3-oxo-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL), N-3-oxo-heptanoylhomoserine lactone (3-oxo-C7-HSL), N-3-hydroxy-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (3-hydroxy-C6-HSL), N-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (C6-HSL), and N-heptanoyl homoserine lactone (C7-HSL); whereas SpsI was primarily responsible for the synthesis of N-butyrylhomoserine lactone (C4-HSL) and N-pentanoylhomoserine lactone (C5-HSL). Furthermore, a quorum quenching analysis by heterologous expression of the Bacillus A24 AiiA lactonase in strain G3 enabled the identification of the AHL-regulated biocontrol-related traits. Depletion of AHLs with this lactonase resulted in altered adhesion and biofilm formation using a microtiter plate assay and flow cells coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy respectively. This was different from the closely related S. plymuthica strains HRO-C48 and RVH1, where biofilm formation for both strains is AHL-independent. In addition, QS in G3 positively regulated antifungal activity, production of exoenzymes, but negatively regulated production of indol-3-acetic acid (IAA), which is in agreement with previous reports in strain HRO-C48. However, in contrast to HRO-C48, swimming motility was not controlled by AHL-mediated QS. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the characterisation of two AHL-based quorum sensing systems in the same isolate of the genus Serratia. Our results show that the QS network is involved in the global regulation of biocontrol-related traits in the endophytic strain G3. However, although free-living and endophytic S. plymuthica share some conservation on QS phenotypic regulation, the control of motility and biofilm formation seems to be strain-specific and possible linked to the life-style of this organism.
TI  - Low-molecular-mass purine nucleoside phosphorylase: characterization and application in enzymatic synthesis of nucleoside antiviral drugs.
AB  - Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) that catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of various purine nucleosides is widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Four pnp genes from Bacillus subtilis 168, Escherichia coli K-12 and Pseudoalteromonas sp. XM2107 were cloned by PCR and expressed in E. coli XL1-Blue. Recombinant PNPs (rPNPs) were purified by Ni(2+)-NTA chromatography. Compared with other rPNPs, PNP(816) was a low-molecular-mass homotrimer, which exhibited 11-, 4- and 1.5-fold higher values in k (cat)/K (m) using inosine as the substrate at 37 degrees C. The PNP(816) or engineered strain XBlue (pQE-816) had a higher catalytic activity than other rPNPs or engineered strains during the enzymatic synthesis of ribavirin, which suggested that the low-molecular-mass homotrimer derived from microorganisms has higher catalytic activity for synthesis of nucleoside antiviral drugs.
TI  - Diversonol and blennolide derivatives from the endophytic fungus Microdiplodia sp.: absolute configuration of diversonol.
AB  - Chemical investigation of the fungal strain Microdiplodia sp. isolated from the shrub Lycium intricatum led to the isolation of four new compounds: a hexahydroxanthone (2), a 2,3-dihydrochroman-4-one (3), a 7-oxoxanthone derivative (4), and a 1,4-oxazepan-7-one (5). The relative configurations of the new compounds were determined by intensive NMR investigations, notably NOESY experiments at different temperatures. The absolute configurations of the well-known fungal metabolite diversonol (1) and of other xanthone derivatives (3, 4) were established by means of TDDFT ECD calculations. Most of the metabolites were biologically active, with antibacterial activity against Legionella pneumophila and/or antifungal activity against Microbotryum violaceum.
TI  - Isolation and identification of soil bacteria growing at the expense of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
AB  - Soil-microorganism symbioses are of fundamental importance for plant adaptation to the environment. Research in microbial ecology has revealed that some soil bacteria are associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, these interactions may be much more complex than originally thought. To assess the type of bacteria associated with AMF, we initially isolated spores of Glomus irregulare from an Agrostis stolonifera rhizosphere. The spores were washed with sterile water and plated onto G. irregulare mycelium growing in vitro in a root-free compartment of bicompartmented Petri dishes. We hypothesized that this system should select for bacteria closely associated with the fungus because the only nutrients available to the bacteria were those derived from the hyphae. Twenty-nine bacterial colonies growing on the AMF hyphae were subcultured and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequences. All bacterial isolates showed high sequence identity to Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus simplex, Kocuria rhizophila, Microbacterium ginsengisoli, Sphingomonas sp. and Variovorax paradoxus. We also assessed bacterial diversity on the surface of spores by PCR-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis. Finally, we used live cellular imaging to show that the bacteria isolated can grow on the surface of hyphae with different growing patterns in contrast to Escherichia coli as a control.
TI  - Streptomyces fenghuangensis sp. nov., isolated from seawater.
AB  - An actinomycete, designated strain GIMN4.003(T), was isolated from seawater collected in Sanya, China. It produced white aerial mycelium and yellow substrate mycelium on Gause's synthetic agar medium no. 1. The substrate mycelium colour was not sensitive to pH. Scanning electron microscopy observations revealed that GIMN4.003(T) produced straight to flexuous spore chains of rough to warty spores. ll-Diaminopimelic acid was present in the cell-wall hydrolysate. Based on chemotaxonomy and morphological features, strain GIMN4.003(T) was identified as a member of the genus Streptomyces. Melanin was not produced. No antimicrobial activity was detected against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Penicillium citrinum or Candida albicans. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the highest sequence similarity was to Streptomyces radiopugnans R97(T) (99.0%). However, DNA relatedness between GIMN4.003(T) and S. radiopugnans DSM 41901(T) was low (41.24+/-1.47%). Furthermore, the morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of strain GIMN4.003(T) were different from those of S. radiopugnans DSM 41901(T) and the type strains of other closely related Streptomyces species. On the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, it is evident that strain GIMN4.003(T) (=CCTCCM 208215(T) =NRRL B-24801(T)) represents the type strain of a novel species within the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces fenghuangensis sp. nov. is proposed.
TI  - The antimicrobial activities of processed Nigerian and South African black tea.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of processed Nigerian Lipton Tea and South African 5 Roses Tea, extracted using distilled water, chloroform and 70% ethanol were determined against nine (9) enteropathogenic bacteria which includes; Bacillus subtilis, Proteus sp, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Salmonella arizona and Staphylococcus aureus. The 2 tea bags, Nigerian Lipton tea bag and the South African 5 Roses tea bag were extracted through Solvent extraction method using 3 extraction solvents; Distilled water, Chloroform and 70% Ethanol and then inoculated onto the Mueller-Hinton agar plates containing the standard isolates at 6 different points on each plate. The zones of inhibition of the bacterial isolates produced by each of these tea - extracts were determined while meaningful antibacterial activities against five (5) of the standard isolates; Enterobacter sp., K. pneumoniae, S. paratyphi A, B. subtilis and S. aureus were observed. Lipton tea water-extract was a more effective antibacterial agent than water-extract of 5 Roses tea. While the 70% ethanol-extract of 5 Roses tea had the greatest antibacterial activity of all the different tea-extract used for the study, the chloroform-extracts of the tea bags had no antimicrobial effect on all the test organisms used.
TI  - [Changes in the bacterial spectrum in severe burn wounds].
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the time axis for increase in Gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients hospitalized at the Clinic of burns and reconstructive surgery between 2006 and 2008 were enrolled in the study. The major criteria for enrolment were more than 15% of total body surface area (TBSA) burned, hospital stay of 1 month or more and age over 18 years. Specimens for microbiological examination were collected on days 2, 6, 10, 14 and 20 after admission. RESULTS: A total of 777 bacterial strains were isolated from the study patients, with 64.6% of these strains being Gram positive and 35.4% Gram negative. The most frequently isolated Gram positive pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (260 strains) and Bacillus sp. (113 strains), while the most common Gram negative pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (81 strains), Escherichia coli (63 strains) and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (57 strains). CONCLUSION: The study provided data that supports the assumption of increase in Gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. Nevertheless, even on day 20 after admission, such strains did not predominate.
TI  - Abyssomicin I, a modified polycyclic polyketide from Streptomyces sp. CHI39.
AB  - Abyssomicin I (1), a new modified polycyclic polyketide, was isolated from the culture extract of a soil-derived Streptomyces sp. The structure of 1 was elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data. The stereochemistry of the new compound was assigned by NOE analysis, chemical derivatization, and application of the modified Mosher method. While 1 was inactive against bacteria and yeasts, the oxidized derivative 7 showed weak activities against gram-positive bacteria. Compounds 1 and 7 exhibited inhibitory effects on tumor cell invasion with IC(50) values of 11 and 0.21 muM, respectively.
TI  - Biocatalytic properties of a recombinant aldo-keto reductase with broad substrate spectrum and excellent stereoselectivity.
AB  - In the screening of 11 E. coli strains overexpressing recombinant oxidoreductases from Bacillus sp. ECU0013, an NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase (YtbE) was identified with capability of producing chiral alcohols. The protein (YtbE) was overexpressed, purified to homogeneity, and characterized of biocatalytic properties. The purified enzyme exhibited the highest activity at 50 degrees C and optimal pH at 6.5. YtbE served as a versatile reductase showing a broad substrate spectrum towards different aromatic ketones and keto esters. Furthermore, a variety of carbonyl substrates were asymmetrically reduced by the purified enzyme with an additionally coupled NADPH regeneration system. The reduction system exhibited excellent enantioselectivity (>99% ee) in the reduction of all the aromatic ketones and high to moderate enantioselectivity in the reduction of alpha- and beta-keto esters. Among the ketones tested, ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate was found to be reduced to ethyl (R)-4,4,4-trifluoro-3-hydroxy butanoate, an important pharmaceutical intermediate, in excellent optical purity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of ytbE gene-encoding recombinant aldo-keto reductase from Bacillus sp. used as biocatalyst for stereoselective reduction of carbonyl compounds. This study provides a useful guidance for further application of this enzyme in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral alcohol enantiomers.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis CwlP of the SP-{beta} prophage has two novel peptidoglycan hydrolase domains, muramidase and cross-linkage digesting DD-endopeptidase.
AB  - For bacteria and bacteriophages, cell wall digestion by hydrolases is a very important event. We investigated one of the proteins involved in cell wall digestion, the yomI gene product (renamed CwlP). The gene is located in the SP-beta prophage region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. Inspection of the Pfam database indicates that CwlP contains soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT) and peptidase M23 domains, which are similar to Escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase Slt70, and the Staphylococcus aureus Gly-Gly endopeptidase LytM, respectively. The SLT domain of CwlP exhibits hydrolytic activity toward the B. subtilis cell wall; however, reverse phase (RP)-HPLC and mass spectrometry revealed that the CwlP-SLT domain has only muramidase activity. In addition, the peptidase M23 domain of CwlP exhibited hydrolytic activity and could cleave d-Ala-diaminopimelic acid cross-linkage, a property associated with dd-endopeptidases. Remarkably, the M23 domain of CwlP possessed a unique Zn(2+)-independent endopeptidase activity; this contrasts with all other characterized M23 peptidases (and enzymes similar to CwlP), which are Zn(2+) dependent. Both domains of CwlP could hydrolyze the peptidoglycan and cell wall of B. subtilis. However, the M23 domain digested neither the peptidoglycans nor the cell walls of S. aureus or Streptococcus thermophilus. The effect of defined point mutations in conserved amino acid residues of CwlP is also determined.
TI  - Heronapyrroles A-C: farnesylated 2-nitropyrroles from an Australian marine-derived Streptomyces sp.
AB  - Chemical analysis of a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. (CMB-M0423) isolated from  beach sand off Heron Island, Australia, yielded three new members of the rare pyrroloterpene biosynthetic structure class. Identified by detailed spectroscopic analysis as the first reported examples of naturally occurring 2-nitropyrroles, heronapyrroles A-C (1-3) displayed promising biological activity-with low to submicromolar IC(50) activity against Gram-positive bacteria but no cytotoxicity toward mammalian cell lines.
TI  - Rational design of a plasmid origin that replicates efficiently in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most plasmids replicate only within a particular genus or family. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe an engineered high copy number expression vector, pBAV1K-T5, that produces varying quantities of active reporter proteins in Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, (all gram-negative), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Leifsonia shinshuensis, Peanibacillus sp. S18-36 and Bacillus subtilis (gram-positive). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate the efficiency of pBAV1K-T5 replication in different bacterial species, thereby facilitating the study of proteins that don't fold well in E. coli and pathogens not amenable to existing genetic tools.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, spectrophotometric, structural and antimicrobial studies of the newly charge transfer complex of p-phenylenediamine with pi acceptor picric acid.
AB  - Charge transfer complex (CTC) of donor, p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and acceptor, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid) has been studied in methanol at room temperature. The CT complex was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR spectra, 1H NMR spectroscopy and electronic absorption spectra which indicate the CT interaction associated with proton migration from the acceptor to the donor followed by hydrogen bonding via N+-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO-. The thermal stability of CT complex was studied using TGA and DTA analyses techniques. The CT complex was screened for its antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger (Laboratory isolate), Candida albicans (IQA-109) and Penicillium sp. (Laboratory isolate) and antibacterial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA 22) and Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051) and two Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (K 12) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 2488). It gives good antimicrobial activity. The stoichiometry of the CT complex was found to be 1:1. The physical parameters of CT complex were evaluated by the Benesi-Hildebrand equation. On the basis of the studies, the structure of CT complex is [(PPDH)+(PA)-], and a general mechanism for its formation is proposed.
TI  - Isolation of culturable microorganisms from free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the southeastern United States.
AB  - Reports of diseases in marine mammals are increasing worldwide, however our understanding of the microorganisms associated with marine mammals is still limited. In this study, we cultured bacteria and fungi isolated from the upper respiratory tract (blowhole), gastric fluid and anus of 180 wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from two estuarine locations along the southeastern Atlantic Coast of the United States. A total of 339 and 491 isolates from Charleston, SC (CHS) and Indian River Lagoon, FL (IRL) dolphins, respectively, were cultured from gastric (70 CHS/82 IRL), fecal (141 CHS/184 IRL), and blowhole (128 CHS/225 IRL) swabs on selective media used for routine clinical microorganisms of human concern. The most frequently cultured Gram-negative bacteria from all sample and study types were Plesiomonas shigelloides, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus sp., and Staphylococcus Coag. Neg were the predominant organisms. For fungi, the most abundant species were Candida glabrata, budding yeasts, and Candida tropicalis. Of concern, the MRSA strain of Staphylococcus aureus was detected in the blowhole and gastric swabs from CHS dolphins. In general, a greater prevalence of bacteria and fungi (four-fold increase) were cultured from IRL than CHS animals. Together, these culture-dependent studies, coupled to on-going culture-independent approaches, should help establish a baseline of microorganisms associated with bottlenose dolphins and aid in the identification of organisms responsible for infectious diseases(s) in these animals.
TI  - Assessment of Euphorbia hirta L. leaf, flower, stem and root extracts for their antibacterial and antifungal activity and brine shrimp lethality.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of the methanolic extracts of Euphorbia hirta L leaves, flowers, stems and roots were evaluated against some medically important bacteria and yeast using the agar disc diffusion method. Four Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus sp., Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus thuringensis), four Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella typhi and P. mirabilis) and one yeast (Candida albicans) species were screened. Inhibition zones ranged between 16-29 mm. Leaves extract inhibited the growth of all tested microorganisms with large zones of inhibition, followed by that of flowers, which also inhibited all the bacteria except C. albicans. The most susceptible microbes to all extracts were S. aureus and Micrococcus sp. Root extract displayed larger inhibition zones against Gram positive bacteria than Gram negative bacteria and had larger inhibition zones compared to stem extract. The lowest MIC values were obtained with E. coli and C. albicans (3.12 mg/mL), followed by S. aureus (12.50 mg/mL) and P. mirabilis (50.00 mg/mL). All the other bacteria had MIC values of 100.00 mg/mL. Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) studies revealed that the cells exposed to leaf extract displayed a rough surface with multiple blends and invaginations which increased with increasing time of treatment, and cells exposed to leaf extract for 36 h showed the most damage, with abundant surface cracks which may be related to final cell collapse and loss of function. Time-kill assay of C. albicans indicated a primarily fungicidal effect at 1- and 2-fold MIC. E. hirta extracts had LC(50) values of 0.71, 0.66, 0.41 and 0.03 mg/mL for stems, leaves, roots and flowers, respectively against Artemia salina. Hence, these plants can be used to discover new bioactive natural products that may serve as leads in the development of new pharmaceuticals.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteria from the gut of Bombyx mori that degrade cellulose, xylan, pectin and starch and their impact on digestion.
AB  - Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. It feeds on mulberry leaves. Mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. Some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. Eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of B. mori, including the Gram positive Bacillus circulans and Gram negative Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia liquefaciens, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas sp., and Erwinia sp.. Three of these isolates, P. vulgaris, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, P. fluorescens and Erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and K. pneumoniae degraded starch. Aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the CMcellulose and xylan. S. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including CMcellulose, xylan and pectin. B. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. The gut of B. mori has an alkaline pH and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline pH. The number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Nocardiopsis sp. from honeybee guts.
AB  - Although actinomycetes are the plant-associated environmental bacteria best known for producing thousands of antibiotics, their presence in the guts of flower-feeding honeybees has rarely been reported. Here, we report on the selective isolation of actinomycetes from the gut microbiota of healthy honeybees, and their inhibitory activity against honeybee indigenous bacteria. More than 70% of the sampled honeybees (N>40) in a season carried at least one CFU of actinomycete. The isolates from bees of one location produced inhibitory bioactivities that were almost exclusively against several bee indigenous Bacillus strains and Gram-positive human pathogens but not Escherichia coli. An antibiotic-producing actinomycete closely related to Nocardiopsis alba was isolated from the guts in every season of the year. A DNA fragment encoding a homologous gene (phzD) involved in phenazine biosynthesis was identified in the isolate. Expression of the phzD detected by reverse transcription-PCR can explain the survival of this organism in anaerobic environments as some redox-active extracellular phenazines are commonly regarded as respiratory electron acceptors. The results raise important questions concerning the roles of the antibiotic-producing actinomycetes and the phenazine-like molecules in honeybee guts and honey.
TI  - Synthesis of optically pure S-sulfoxide by Escherichia coli transformant cells coexpressing the P450 monooxygenase and glucose dehydrogenase genes.
AB  - A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450SMO) from Rhodococcus sp. can catalyze asymmetric oxygenation of sulfides to S-sulfoxides. However, P450SMO-catalyzed biotransformations require a constant supply of NAD(P)H, the expense of which constitutes a great hindrance for this enzyme application. In this study, we investigated the asymmetric oxygenation of sulfide to S-sulfoxide using E. coli cells, which co-express both the P450SMO gene from Rhodococcus sp. and the glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) gene from Bacillus subtilis, as a catalyst. The results showed that the catalytic performance of co-expression systems was markedly improved compared to the system lacking GDH. When using recombinant E. coli BL21 (pET28a-P450-GDH) whole cell as a biocatalyst, NADPH was efficiently regenerated when glucose was supplemented in the reaction system. A total conversion of 100% was achieved within 12 h with 2 mM p-chlorothioanisole substrate, affording 317.3 mg/L S-sulfoxide obtained. When the initial sulfide concentration was increased to 5 mM, the substrate conversion was also increased nearly fivefold: S-sulfoxide amounted to 2.5 mM (396.6 mg/L) and the ee value of sulfoxide product exceeded 98%. In this system, the effects of glucose concentration and substrate concentration were further investigated for efficient biotransformation. This system is highly advantageous for the synthesis of optically pure S-sulfoxide.
TI  - Diversity and antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi associated with the alpine plant Saussurea involucrata.
AB  - Endophytic fungi are rich in species diversity and may play an important role in  the fitness of their host plants. This study investigated the diversity and antimicrobial potential of endophytic fungi obtained from Saussurea involucrata KAR. et KIR. A total of 49 endophytic fungi were isolated from S. involucrata and identified using morphological and molecular techniques. Extracts of fermentation broth from the 49 fungi were tested for antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms using the agar diffusion method. Forty-eight out of the 49 endophytic fungi were identified and grouped into 14 taxa. Cylindrocarpon sp. was the dominant species isolated from S. involucrata, followed by Phoma sp. and Fusarium sp. Among the 49 endophytic fungi, 9 root isolates having darkly pigmented, septate hyphae were identified as dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungus, and 12 fungi inhibited at least one test microorganism. Moreover, 5 strains showed a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity and 4 strains displayed strong inhibition (+++) against pathogenic fungi. The results indicate that endophytic fungi isolated from S. involucrata are diverse in species and a potential source of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Isolation, structure determination and antibacterial activities of succinamide conjugate diacid from Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L.
AB  - Strain BJ-L was isolated from the a water sample taken from Xiao Yue River in Beijing and identified as Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L based on the study of its morphology, physiology, biochemistry and 16S rRNA gene sequence. A new antimicrobial substance was produced after the strain was incubated in potato extract medium at 15 degrees C for 72 h. The antimicrobial substance was sequentially purified by reduced pressure condensation, EtOAc extract, and silica gel column chromatography. The structure of the antimicrobial substance was elucidated as succinamide conjugate diacid (SCD) by spectroscopic data interpretation. Structure analysis indicated that SCD is a novel compound and that it could inhibit the growth of some tested bacterial strains with the MIC of 2mg/ml, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Moreover, no obvious toxicity has been found on cultured HUVEC cells with different concentrations of SCD at 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/ml.
TI  - Production of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles in water extracts of the fungus  Amylomyces rouxii strain KSU-09.
AB  - A fungal strain, KSU-09, isolated from the roots of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), was identified as Amylomyces rouxii based on sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of its rRNA genes. Mycelia-free water extracts obtained from mycelium suspended in water for 72h facilitated the production of stable, predominantly monodispersed and spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the size range of 5-27nm upon addition of 1mM silver nitrate, as determined by the XRD, AFM and TEM. The AgNPs exhibited antimicrobial activity against Shigella dysenteriae type I, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans and Fusarium oxysporum. Thus, the strain KSU-09 could be used for simple, non-hazardous and efficient synthesis of antimicrobial AgNPs.
TI  - Characterization of a dual specificity aryl acid adenylation enzyme with dual function in nikkomycin biosynthesis.
AB  - Nikkomycin Z is a dipeptide antifungal antibiotic characterized by two nonproteinogenic amino acids, nikkomycin C(Z) and 4-(4'-hydroxy-2'-pyridinyl)-homothreonine (HPHT). The HPHT scaffold is assembled by an aldol reaction between 2-oxobutyrate and picolinaldehyde, the latter of which is derived from picolinic acid that is activated and loaded to coenzyme A by the aryl-activating adenylation enzyme, NikE. We now provide evidence that NikE is also involved in the activation and loading of the alpha-keto acid precursor, 4-(2'-pyridinyl)-2-oxo-4-hydroxyisovalerate (POHIV), to a phosphopantetheinyl group of an acyl carrier protein domain of NikT. POHIV was synthesized using Escherichia coli 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase, and phenylalanine dehydrogenase from Bacillus sp. NRRL B-14911 was used to prepare the alpha-amino acid, 4-(2'-pyridinyl)-homothreonine (PHT). Using the carboxylic acid-dependent, ATP-[(32)P]PP(i) exchange assay, NikE is shown to activate both picolinic acid and POHIV but not PHT. Furthermore, NikE loads POHIV to holo-NikT to generate a new thioester-linked intermediate, which was not observed using a NikT(S33A) mutant. Thus, NikE activates two distinct carboxylic acids to form two new thioester intermediates, one of which is subsequently reduced to the aldehyde and the other that likely serves as a substrate for the aminotransferase domain of NikT prior to condensation with nikkomycin C(Z) to yield the dipeptide.
TI  - Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of serine proteases and homologs in the silkworm Bombyx mori.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serine proteases (SPs) and serine proteases homologs (SPHs) are a large group of proteolytic enzymes, with important roles in a variety of physiological processes, such as cell signalling, defense and development. Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of serine proteases and their homologs in the silkworm might provide valuable information about their biological functions. RESULTS: In this study, 51 SP genes and 92 SPH genes were systematically identified in the genome of the silkworm Bombyx mori. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that six gene families have been amplified species-specifically in the silkworm, and the members of them showed chromosomal distribution of tandem repeats. Microarray analysis suggests that many silkworm-specific genes, such as members of SP_fam12, 13, 14 and 15, show expression patterns that are specific to tissues or developmental stages. The roles of SPs and SPHs in resisting pathogens were investigated in silkworms when they were infected by Escherichia coli, Bacillus bombysepticus, Batrytis bassiana and B. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus, respectively. Microarray experiment and real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that 18 SP or SPH genes were significantly up-regulated after pathogen induction, suggesting that SP and SPH genes might participate in pathogenic microorganism resistance in B. mori. CONCLUSION: Silkworm SP and SPH genes were identified. Comparative genomics showed that SP and SPH genes belong to a large family, whose members are generated mainly by tandem repeat evolution. We found that silkworm has species-specific SP and SPH genes. Phylogenetic and microarray analyses provide an overview of the silkworm SP and SPHs, and facilitate future functional studies on these enzymes.
TI  - Molecular and enzymatic characterization of a subfamily I.4 lipase from an edible oil-degrader Bacillus sp. HH-01.
AB  - An edible-oil degrading bacterial strain HH-01 was isolated from oil plant gummy  matter and was classified as a member of the genus Bacillus on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene. A putative lipase gene and its flanking regions were cloned from the strain based on its similarity to lipase genes from other Bacillus spp. The deduced product was composed of 214 amino acids and the putative mature protein, consisting of 182 amino acids, exhibited 82% amino acid sequence identity with the subfamily I.4 lipase LipA of Bacillus subtilis 168. The recombinant product was successfully overproduced as a soluble form in Escherichia coli and showed lipase activity. The gene was, therefore, designated as lipA of HH-01. HH-01 LipA was stable at pH 4-11 and up to 30 degrees C, and its optimum pH and temperature were 8-9 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme showed preferential hydrolysis of the 1(3)-position ester bond in trilinolein. The activity was, interestingly, enhanced by supplementing with 1 mM CoCl(2), in contrast to other Bacillus lipases. The lipA gene seemed to be constitutively transcribed during the exponential growth phase, regardless of the presence of edible oil.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of prunin, a citric flavanone glucoside, and its prunin  6''-O-lauroyl ester.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the antimicrobial potential of prunin (P), a flavanone glucoside resulting from the hydrolysis of naringin present in grapefruit, and of its prunin 6''-O-lauroyl ester (PL), synthesized by enzymatic catalysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: P and its lauroyl ester were tested against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and moulds. P showed no inhibitory effect against the micro-organisms assayed, but stimulated growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and different Bacilllus sp. However, 150 mug ml(-1) of PL inhibited Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, many Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213, Enterococcus avium DSMZ17511, and different Listeria monocytogenes strains. In the last case, L. monocytogenes, sensitive or bacteriocin-resistant cells, lost nearly 4-log reductions after 30 min of contact. A bactericidal mode of action was determined using both scanning and transmission electronic microscopies. CONCLUSIONS: PL could be used as a food additive, because at low concentration (150 mug ml(-1)) it exhibited antimicrobial activity against important food-borne pathogens. A bactericidal effect was also determined on L. monocytogenes sensitive and bacteriocin-resistant mutant strains. P did not show any antimicrobial property at all. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: PL is a potential antimicrobial compound with a high anti-Listeria property.
TI  - Defensin of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  - A 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (EST) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) foot cDNA library developed in our laboratory. The D. polymorpha defensin (Dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. The mature Dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin A domain. Homologue searching against GenBank database suggested that this Dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. Predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of Dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin A. The recombinant Dpd was in vitro expressed through an Escherichia coli expression system. The antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant Dpd were found against the growth of Morganella sp., Plesiomonas shigelloides, Edwardsiella tarda, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus aureus (ATCC12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microM, respectively. However, with less than 50 microM no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, Motile Aeromonas, Flavobacterium sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium ATCC14581, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum ATCC27865, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Micrococcus leteus ATCC4698), and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of Dpd in the zebra mussel suggested that the Dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. By using the quantitative PCR, the expression level of Dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. By comparing the amount of Dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qPCR, we found that the higher expression levels of Dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. Findings of this study suggest that the expression of the Dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
TI  - A metal-repressed promoter from gram-positive Bacillus subtilis is highly active  and metal-induced in gram-negative Cupriavidus metallidurans.
AB  - A synthetic version of the metal-regulated gene A (mrgA) promoter from Bacillus subtilis, which in this Gram-positive bacterium is negatively regulated by manganese, iron, cobalt, or copper turned out to promote high level of basal gene expression that is further enhanced by Co(II), Cd(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), or Ni(II), when cloned in the Gram-negative bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans. Promoter activity was monitored by expression of the reporter gene coding for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and cellular intensity fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry. Expression levels in C. metallidurans driven by the heterologous promoter, here called pan, ranged from 20- to 53-fold the expression level driven by the Escherichia coli lac promoter (which is constitutively expressed in C. metallidurans), whether in the absence or presence of metal ions, respectively. The pan promoter did also function in E. coli in a constitutive pattern, regardless of the presence of Mn(II) or Fe(II). In conclusion, the pan promoter proved to be a powerful tool to express heterologous proteins in Gram-negative bacteria, especially in C. metallidurans grown upon high levels of toxic metals, with potential applications in bioremediation.
TI  - Characterisation of the flavin-free oxygen-tolerant azoreductase from Xenophilus  azovorans KF46F in comparison to flavin-containing azoreductases.
AB  - The flavin-free azoreductase from Xenophilus azovorans KF46F (AzoB), which has been the very first characterized oxygen-tolerant azoreductase, was analyzed in comparison to various recently described flavin-containing azoreductases from different bacterial sources. Sequence comparisons demonstrated that the azoreductase from X. azovorans KF46F is a member of the NmrA family of proteins and demonstrates 30% sequence identity with a NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli (encoded by ytfG). In contrast, it was found that the flavin-containing azoreductases from E. coli OY1-2 (AZR), Bacillus sp. OY1-2 (AZR) and related azoreductases all belong to the FMN_red superfamily of enzymes. The substrate specificity of AzoB was reanalyzed in respect to the recently characterized flavin-containing azoreductases, and it was found that purified AzoB converted in addition to different ortho-hydroxy azo compounds [such as Orange II = 1-(4'-sulfophenylazo)-2-naphthol] also the simple non-hydroxylated non-sulfonated azo dye Methyl Red (4'-dimethylaminoazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid), but no indications for the conversion of quinones were obtained. Significant differences were observed in the substrate specificities between AzoB and the flavin-containing azoreductases. The kinetic analysis of the turn-over of Orange II by AzoB suggested an ordered bireactant reaction mechanism which was different from the ping-pong mechanism suggested for the flavin-containing azoreductases.
TI  - I-SceI endonuclease: a new tool for DNA repair studies and genetic manipulations  in streptomyces.
AB  - Actinomycetes are Gram-positive bacteria with a complex life cycle. They produce  many pharmaceutically relevant secondary metabolites, including antibiotics and anticancer drugs. However, there is a limited number of biotechnological applications available as opposed to genetic model organisms like Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli. We report here a system for the functional expression of a synthetic gene encoding the I-SceI homing endonuclease in several streptomycetes. Using the synthetic sce(a) gene, we were able to create controlled genomic DNA double-strand breaks. A mutagenesis system, based on the homing endonuclease I-SceI, has been developed to construct targeted, non-polar, unmarked gene mutations in Streptomyces sp. Tu6071. In addition, we have shown that homologous recombination is a major pathway in streptomycetes to repair an I-SceI-generated DNA double-strand break. This novel I-SceI-based tool will be useful in fundamental studies on the repair mechanism of DNA double-strand breaks and for a variety of biotechnological applications.
TI  - A survey of veterinary hospitals in Nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the Sokoto metropolis of north-western Nigeria. A total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. Bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: Bacillus sp. (27.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), Listeria sp. (13.6%), Streptococcus sp. (11.4%), Salmonella sp. (6.8%), Escherichia coli (4.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), Citrobacter sp. (2.3%), Klebsiella sp. (2.3%), Lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), Micrococcus sp. (2.3%), Pasteurella sp. (2.3%), Proteus sp. (2.3%), and Yersinia sp. (2.3%). A higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. Some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. In this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the Sokoto region of north-western Nigeria. Of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in Nigeria. It was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.
TI  - Antibiofilm activity of the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3J6.
AB  - Biofilm formation results in medical threats or economic losses and is therefore  a major concern in a variety of domains. In two-species biofilms of marine bacteria grown under dynamic conditions, Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3J6 formed mixed biofilms with Bacillus sp. strain 4J6 but was largely predominant over Paracoccus sp. strain 4M6 and Vibrio sp. strain D01. The supernatant of Pseudoalteromonas sp. 3J6 liquid culture (SN(3J6)) was devoid of antibacterial activity against free-living Paracoccus sp. 4M6 and Vibrio sp. D01 cells, but it impaired their ability to grow as single-species biofilms and led to higher percentages of nonviable cells in 48-h biofilms. Antibiofilm molecules of SN(3J6) were able to coat the glass surfaces used to grow biofilms and reduced bacterial attachment about 2-fold, which might partly explain the biofilm formation defect but not the loss of cell viability. SN(3J6) had a wide spectrum of activity since it affected all Gram-negative marine strains tested except other Pseudoalteromonas strains. Biofilm biovolumes of the sensitive strains were reduced 3- to 530-fold, and the percentages of nonviable cells were increased 3- to 225-fold. Interestingly, SN(3J6) also impaired biofilm formation by three strains belonging to the human-pathogenic species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli. Such an antibiofilm activity is original and opens up a variety of applications for Pseudoalteromonas sp. 3J6 and/or its active exoproducts in biofilm prevention strategies.
TI  - Culture-independent techniques applied to food industry water surveillance--a case study.
AB  - Culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a German dairy company and a Spanish dry cured ham company. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. Autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised DGGE DNA bands. More specifically, real-time PCR was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterococcus spp., Salmonella spp, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to the detection limits of the real-time PCR method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. Autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. Only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the German dairy company. Enterococci and P.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. Some opportunistic bacteria as Enterobacter sp., Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic Bacillus, were also detected after DNA sequencing of DGGE bands.
TI  - Screening a novel Na+/H+ antiporter gene from a metagenomic library of halophiles colonizing in the Dagong Ancient Brine Well in China.
AB  - Metagenomic DNA libraries constructed from the Dagong Ancient Brine Well were screened for genes with Na(+)/H(+) antiporter activity on the antiporter-deficient Escherichia coli KNabc strain. One clone with a stable Na(+)-resistant phenotype was obtained and its Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene was sequenced and designated as m-nha. The deduced amino acid sequence of M-Nha protein consists of 523 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 58 147 Da and a pI of 5.50, which is homologous with NhaH from Halobacillus dabanensis D-8(T) (92%) and Halobacillus aidingensis AD-6(T) (86%), and with Nhe2 from Bacillus sp. NRRL B-14911 (64%). It had a hydropathy profile with 10 putative transmembrane domains and a long carboxyl terminal hydrophilic tail of 140 amino acid residues, similar to Nhap from Synechocystis sp. and Aphanothece halophytica, as well as NhaG from Bacillus subtilis. The m-nha gene in the antiporter-negative mutant E. coli KNabc conferred resistance to Na(+) and the ability to grow under alkaline conditions. The difference in amino acid sequence and the putative secondary structure suggested that the m-nha isolated from the Dagong Ancient Brine Well in this study was a novel Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene.
TI  - Contribution of extracellular polymeric substances on representative gram negative and gram positive bacterial deposition in porous media.
AB  - The significance of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on cell transport and retained bacteria profiles in packed porous media (quartz sand) was examined by direct comparison of the overall deposition kinetics and retained profiles of untreated bacteria (with EPS) versus those of treated cells (without EPS) from the same cell type. Four representative cell types, Pseudomonas sp. QG6 (gram-negative, motile), mutant Escherichia coli BL21 (gram-negative, nonmotile), Bacillus subtilis (gram-positive, motile), and Rhodococcus sp. QL2 (gram-positive, nonmotile), were employed to systematically determine the influence of EPS on cell transport and deposition behavior. Packed column experiments were conducted for the untreated and treated cells in both NaCl (four ionic strength ranging from 2.5 mM to 20 mM) and CaCl(2) (5 mM) solutions at pH 6.0. The breakthrough plateaus of untreated bacteria were lower than those of treated bacteria for all four cell types under all examined conditions (in both NaCl and CaCl(2) solutions), indicating that the presence of EPS on cell surfaces enhanced cell deposition in porous media regardless of cell type and motility. Retained profiles of both untreated and treated cells for all four cell types deviated from classic filtration theory (log-linear decreases). However, the degree of deviation was greater for all four untreated cells, indicating that the presence of EPS on cell surfaces increased the deviation of retained profiles from classic filtration theory. Elution experiments demonstrated that neither untreated nor treated cells preferentially deposited in secondary energy minima. Furthermore, the release of previously deposited cells in the secondary energy minima did not change the shape of retained cell profiles, indicating that deposition in secondary energy minima did not produce the observed deviations of retained profiles from classic filtration theory.
TI  - A new prenylated flavanoid with antibacterial activity from propolis collected in Egypt.
AB  - A novel prenylated flavanoid, isonymphaeol-D (1), together with two known compounds, isonymphaeol-B (2) and nymphaeol-B (3), were isolated from Egyptian propolis. The structures of the isolated compounds were determined by various spectroscopic methods. 1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative strains (Serratia sp., Pseudomonos sp., Escherichia coli).
TI  - Streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov., a lactic acid-producing streptomycete isolated from the rhizosphere of tomato plants.
AB  - A novel actinomycete, designated strain GIMN4.001(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere of tomato plants grown in Guangzhou, China. The strain produced greyish white aerial mycelia, lactic acid and a large quantity of double diamond-shaped crystals on potato dextrose agar and yeast extract-malt extract agar. The colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to pH. Microscopic observations revealed that strain GIMN4.001(T) produced verticillate chains of cylindrical spores. Chemotaxonomic data confirmed that strain GIMN4.001(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Melanin pigments were not produced. No antibacterial activity was observed against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis or Candida albicans, but inhibitory activity was observed against Penicillium citrinum. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain GIMN4.001(T) was related most closely to Streptomyces morookaense ATCC 19166(T) (98.9 % similarity) and Streptomyces lavenduligriseus ATCC 13306(T) (98.7 %). Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain GIMN4.001(T) and the type strains of these species were low (14-20 %). Furthermore, strain GIMN4.001(T) could be differentiated from S. morookaense, S. lavenduligriseus and other closely related species of the genus Streptomyces based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. On the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, strain GIMN4.001(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GIMN4.001(T) (=CCTCC M208214(T)=NRRL B-24800(T)).
TI  - The swaposin-like domain of potato aspartic protease (StAsp-PSI) exerts antimicrobial activity on plant and human pathogens.
AB  - Plant-specific insert domain (PSI) is a region of approximately 100 amino acid residues present in most plant aspartic protease (AP) precursors. PSI is not a true saposin domain; it is the exchange of the N- and C-terminal portions of the saposin like domain. Hence, PSI is called a swaposin domain. Here, we report the cloned, heterologous expression and purification of PSI from StAsp 1 (Solanum tuberosum aspartic protease 1), called StAsp-PSI. Results obtained here show that StAsp-PSI is able to kill spores of two potato pathogens in a dose-dependent manner without any deleterious effect on plant cells. As reported for StAPs (S. tuberosum aspartic proteases), the StAsp-PSI ability to kill microbial pathogens is dependent on the direct interaction of the protein with the microbial cell wall/or membrane, leading to increased permeability and lysis. Additionally, we demonstrated that, like proteins of the SAPLIP family, StAsp-PSI and StAPs are cytotoxic to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. The amino acid residues conserved in SP_B (pulmonary surfactant protein B) and StAsp-PSI could explain the cytotoxic activity exerted by StAsp-PSI and StAPs against Gram-positive bacteria. These results and data previously reported suggest that the presence of the PSI domain in mature StAPs could be related to their antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Effect of high pressure on the microbiological quality of cooked chicken during storage at normal and abuse refrigeration temperatures.
AB  - Vacuum-packaged cooked poultry meat was treated at a range of pressures (400-600  MPa) and hold times (1, 2 and 10 min), followed by storage at 4 degrees , 8 degrees or 12 degrees C for up to 35 days. Weissella viridescens was found to be the dominant microorganism in the pressure-treated meat, constituting 100% of the microflora identified at 500 and 600 MPa. None of the pressure-treated samples had obvious signs of spoilage during the 35 day storage period, even when the Weissella count was >7 log(10) cfu/g. Studies on a typical W. viridescens isolate showed it to be relatively pressure-resistant in poultry meat, with <1 log reduction in numbers after a treatment of 2 min at 600 MPa. Agar diffusion assays showed that the isolate also caused the inhibition of a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including strains of Clostridium botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. The selection of a pressure-resistant organism, such as this Weissella sp. could be advantageous in extending the shelf-life, and also microbiological safety, of the cooked meat, as it could give protection in addition to the pressure treatment itself.
TI  - Modified phenazines from an Indonesian Streptomyces sp.
AB  - Fractionation of the extract from the Indonesian Streptomyces sp. ICBB8198 as directed by the antibacterial activity delivered the known phenazine antibiotics griseoluteic acid (1a) and griseolutein A (1b), as well as two new phenazine derivatives (2 and 3). In addition, the known compounds spirodionic acid, dihydrosarkomycins, and 6-ethyl-4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2-one (4a), along with the new pyrone 3,6-diethyl-4-hydroxy-5-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (4b), were isolated. We report here the isolation, structure elucidation, and antibiotic activity of the new metabolites as well as a hypothetical pathway for the formation of the new phenazine derivatives.
TI  - Glucose 6-phosphate accumulation in mycobacteria: implications for a novel F420-dependent anti-oxidant defense system.
AB  - Glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) is a metabolic intermediate with many possible cellular fates. In mycobacteria, G6P is a substrate for an enzyme, F(420)-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fgd), found in few bacterial genera. Intracellular G6P levels in six Mycobacterium sp. were remarkably higher ( approximately 17-130-fold) than Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium. The high G6P level in Mycobacterium smegmatis may result from 10-25-fold higher activity of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase when grown on glucose, glycerol, or acetate compared with B. megaterium and E. coli. In M. smegmatis this coincided with up-regulation of the first gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, when acetate was the carbon source, suggesting a cellular program for maintaining high G6P levels. G6P was depleted in cells under oxidative stress induced by redox cycling agents plumbagin and menadione, whereas an fgd mutant of M. smegmatis used G6P less well under such conditions. The fgd mutant was more sensitive to these agents and, in contrast to wild type, was defective in its ability to reduce extracellular plumbagin and menadione. These data suggest that intracellular G6P in mycobacteria serves as a source of reducing power and, with the mycobacteria-specific Fgd-F(420) system, plays a protective role against oxidative stress.
TI  - Discorhabdins from the Korean marine sponge Sceptrella sp.
AB  - Two new pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids of the discorhabdin class, along with 12 compounds including one previously described synthetic derivative of the same and related skeletal classes, were isolated from the sponge Sceptrella sp., collected from Gageodo, Korea. The structures of these new compounds, designated as (-)-3-dihydrodiscorhabdin D (11) and (-)-discorhabdin Z (12), were determined by combined spectroscopic analyses. Compound 12 possesses an unusual hemiaminal group among the discorhabdin alkaloids. These compounds exhibited moderate to significant cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and inhibitory activity against sortase A.
TI  - Hydroxylated sclerosporin derivatives from the marine-derived fungus Cadophora malorum.
AB  - The marine-derived fungus Cadophora malorum was isolated from the green alga Enteromorpha sp. Growth on a biomalt medium supplemented with sea salt yielded an extract, from which we have isolated sclerosporin and four new hydroxylated sclerosporin derivatives, namely, 15-hydroxysclerosporin (2), 12-hydroxysclerosporin (3), 11-hydroxysclerosporin (4), and 8-hydroxysclerosporin (5). The compounds were evaluated in various biological activity assays. Compound 5 showed a weak fat-accumulation inhibitory activity against 3T3-L1 murine adipocytes.
TI  - A thermostable phytase from Bacillus sp. MD2: cloning, expression and high-level  production in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Phytase is used as a feed additive for degradation of antinutritional phytate, and the enzyme is desired to be highly thermostable for it to withstand feed formulation conditions. A Bacillus sp. MD2 showing phytase activity was isolated, and the phytase encoding gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant phytase exhibited high stability at temperatures up to 100 degrees C. A higher enzyme activity was obtained when the gene expression was done in the presence of calcium chloride. Production of the enzyme by batch- and fed-batch cultivation in a bioreactor was studied. In batch cultivation, maintaining dissolved oxygen at 20-30% saturation and depleting inorganic phosphate below 1 mM prior to induction by IPTG resulted in over 10 U/ml phytase activity. For fed-batch cultivation, glucose concentration was maintained at 2-3 g/l, and the phytase expression was increased to 327 U/ml. Induction using lactose during fed-batch cultivation showed a lag phase of 4 h prior to an increase in the phytase activity to 71 U/ml during the same period as IPTG-induced production. Up to 90% of the total amount of expressed phytase leaked out from the E. coli cells in both IPTG- and lactose-induced fed-batch cultivations.
TI  - Ring B aromatic steroids from an endophytic fungus, Colletotrichum sp.
AB  - The new (22E,24R)-3-acetoxy-19(10-->6)-abeo-ergosta-5,7,9,22-tetraen-3beta-ol (1) and the known (22E,24R)-19(10-->6)-abeo-ergosta-5,7,9,22-tetraen-3beta-ol (2), two interesting ergosteroids with rare aromatized ring B, together with seven known derivatives, namely (22E,24R)-ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3beta-ol (3), (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,7,22-trien-3-one (4), (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (5), (22E,24R)-5alpha,8alpha-epidioxyergosta-6,22-dien-3beta-ol (6), (22E,24R)-ergosta-7,22-dien-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol (7), (22E,24R)-6-acetoxy-ergosta-7,22-dien-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol (8), and (22E,24R)-3,6-diacetoxy-ergosta-7,22-dien-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol (9), were isolated from Colletotrichum sp., an endophytic fungus isolated from Ilex canariensis from Gomera. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis, comparison with reported data, and chemical interconversion. The isolation of these metabolites not only displays a beautiful array of chemical diversity, but also gives insight into the biosynthetic interconnections. Preliminary studies showed antimicrobial activity of these compounds against the fungus Microbotryum violaceum, the alga Chlorella fusca, and the bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium.
TI  - Microbiologic evaluation of gallbladder bile of healthy dogs and dogs with iatrogenic hypercortisolism: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In people, hypercortisolism (HC) has been associated with acalculous  cholecystitis and biliary dyskinesia, which may potentiate ascending biliary infections. In dogs, an association between HC and gallbladder disease recently has been documented, although the role of bacteria remains controversial. Furthermore, there is no information on the gallbladder bile microbial flora in healthy dogs. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the microbial flora in gallbladder bile in healthy dogs, the relationship between iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism and bactibilia and possible changes in biliary microbial flora after cortisol withdrawal in dogs. ANIMALS: Six control dogs and 6 dogs treated with hydrocortisone. METHODS: Gallbladder bile obtained by percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis was cultured aerobically and anaerobically and examined cytologically before (d0), during (d28, d56, d84), and after (d28p, d56p, d84p) administration of hydrocortisone (8 mg/kg PO q12h). RESULTS: In the control group, 2/42 bile cultures yielded bacterial growth (Enterococcus sp.; Escherichia coli on d0) and 1/42 bile smears had cytological evidence of bacteria (d28). In the HC group, 2/42 bile cultures yielded bacterial growth (Enterococcus sp. on d28; Bacillus sp. on d28p) and 3/42 bile smears had cytological evidence of bacteria (d84, d84, d28p). All dogs remained healthy throughout the study period (168d). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Based on the results of conventional bacterial culture techniques, gallbladder bile of healthy dogs periodically may harbor bacteria, which do not appear to be clinically relevant. A 3-month period of iatrogenic HC was not associated with bactibilia. A higher prevalence of bactibilia may be detected with micromolecular techniques.
TI  - An antimicrobial guanidine-bearing sesterterpene from the cultured cyanobacterium Scytonema sp.
AB  - Scytoscalarol (1), a antimicrobial sesterterpene bearing a guanidino group, was isolated from the cultured cyanobacterium Scytonema sp. (UTEX 1163) by bioassay-guided fractionation. The chemical structure was determined by spectroscopic analysis including MS and 1D and 2D NMR. Scytoscalarol (1) showed antimicrobial activities against Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis with MIC values in the range from 2 to 110 microM.
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - Molecular cloning, over expression, and activity studies of a peptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitor: designed synthetic gene to functional recombinant peptide.
AB  - The aspartic protease inhibitor (ATBI) purified from a Bacillus sp. is a potent inhibitor of several proteases including recombinant HIV-1 protease, pepsin, and fungal aspartic protease. In this study, we report the cloning, and over expression of a synthetic gene coding for ATBI in Escherichia coli and establish a purification protocol. The ATBI molecule consists of eleven amino acids and is peptidic in nature. We used the peptide sequence data of ATBI to synthesize complementary oligonucleotides, which were annealed and subsequently cloned in-frame with the gene for glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The expression of the resulting fusion protein was induced in E. coli BL21-A1 cells using arabinose. The recombinant peptide was purified using a reduced glutathione column, and cleaved with Factor Xa to remove the GST tag. The resultant product was further purified to homogeneity using RP-HPLC. Mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that the purified peptide had a molecular weight of 1186Da which matches the theoretical molecular weight of the amino acids present in the synthetic gene. The recombinant peptide was found to be active in vitro against HIV-1 protease, pepsin, and fungal aspartic protease. The protocol described in this study may be used to clone pharmaceutically important peptide molecules.
TI  - The microbial colonisation of mobile phone used by healthcare staffs.
AB  - Mobile phones are dispensable accessories in social life and normally they are not cleaned properly. Therefore, they serve as a reservoir of bacteria and may cause nosocomial infections in hospitals. The purpose of this study was to investigate microbiological colonization of mobile phones used by healthcare staffs. The study was carried out collecting swab samples with Cary-Blair transport medium from mobile phones of attending healthcare staffs from different departments of three hospitals in March, 2008. All collected samples were inoculated in 5% sheep blood agar, eosin-methylene blue agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar. Isolated bacteria were identified using by classic technique and Vitec2 (Biomerieux, France) full automated bacteria identification system. Growth was observed in 65 of collected 106 samples, corresponding to 61.3%. The most frequent bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Corynebacterium sp. and Escherichia coli, respectively. In conclusion, bacteria were colonized on mobile phones frequently and mobile phones may become reservoir of microorganism for nosocomial infections.
TI  - Chemical composition, antifungal and antibacterial activity of the essential oil  of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis from Spain.
AB  - The chemical composition of the oil of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach. has been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 34 compounds were identified representing more than 90% of the total oil. The oil was richer in monoterpenes than in sesquiterpenes, the major constituents being limonene (53.2%), 6-3-carene (21.0%) and a-pinene (12.2%). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the oil were also tested against Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp. and Serratia marcescens. Only two of these, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans, were sensitive to the treatment, inhibition zones of 11 and 14 mm diameter being obtained, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first report of the antifungal and antibacterial activity of this species.
TI  - Uncovering the protocatechuate 2,3-cleavage pathway genes.
AB  - Paenibacillus sp. (formerly Bacillus macerans) strain JJ-1b is able to grow on 4-hydroxybenzoate (4HB) as a sole source of carbon and energy and is known to degrade 4HB via the protocatechuate (PCA) 2,3-cleavage pathway. However, none of the genes involved in this pathway have been identified. In this study, we identified and characterized the JJ-1b genes for the 4HB catabolic pathway via the PCA 2,3-cleavage pathway, which consisted of praR and praABEGFDCHI. Based on the enzyme activities of cell extracts of Escherichia coli carrying praI, praA, praH, praB, praC, and praD, these genes were found to code for 4HB 3-hydroxylase, PCA 2,3-dioxygenase, 5-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde decarboxylase, 2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, 4-oxalocrotonate (OCA) tautomerase, and OCA decarboxylase, respectively, which are involved in the conversion of 4HB into 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate (HPD). The praE, praF, and praG gene products exhibited 45 to 61% amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding enzymes responsible for the catabolism of HPD to pyruvate and acetyl coenzyme A. The deduced amino acid sequence of praR showed similarity with those of IclR-type transcriptional regulators. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that praABEGFDCHI constitute an operon, and these genes were expressed during the growth of JJ-1b on 4HB and PCA. praR-praABEGFDCHI conferred the ability to grow on 4HB to E. coli, suggesting that praEGF were functional for the conversion of HPD to pyruvate and acetyl coenzyme A. A promoter analysis suggested that praR encodes a repressor of the pra operon.
TI  - Improvement of extracellular production of a thermophilic subtilase expressed in  Escherichia coli by random mutagenesis of its N-terminal propeptide.
AB  - Limited secretion capacity remains a drawback of using Escherichia coli as the host for the production of recombinant proteins. In this report, random mutagenesis was performed within the N-terminal propeptide of thermostable WF146 protease, a subtilase from thermophilic Bacillus sp. WF146, generating a variant named WBM(MT) with improved capacity for extracellular production when expressed in E. coli. Two mutations, L(-57)Q and E(-10)D, were identified within the N-terminal propeptide. The amount of WBM(MT) in the culture medium was found to be about three times higher than that of wild type. Besides, the introduction of mutations L(-57)Q/E(-10)D into the N-terminal propeptide also accelerated the maturation of the enzyme. Biochemical analysis indicated that the thermostability and the catalytic activity of mature WBM(MT) were similar to those of wild type. Far-UV CD spectra analysis and limited proteolysis experiments suggested that the mutations L(-57)Q/E(-10)D resulted in a structural change in the N-terminal propeptide of the proform, and the N-terminal propeptide became more flexible, which might be beneficial for the proform to keep in a translocation-competent state. Our result indicates that N-terminal propeptide engineering may be a valuable approach for improving extracellular production of recombinant subtilases expressed in E. coli.
TI  - Growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: Effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  - Simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in Portable Microbe Enrichment Unit (PMEU) linked with ChemPro100i((R)) gas detector. The effects of vancomycin were evaluated in aerobic cultures. Growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, pH alterations, and colony counts on BD CHROMagar Orientation plates. Results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, Escherichia coli E 17 and Klebsiella mobilis ATCC 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, Bacillus cereus or Staphylococcus aureus. When the evaporations of the mixed cultures of E. coli, K. mobilis and S. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by ChemPro100i((R)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant E. coli and K. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. A survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big University Hospital, (Salzburg, Austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. Only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). Enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). In anaerobiosis it was shown that Klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the E. coli. The ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in the gas stream of the PMEU culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. The synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter strains is suggested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Survey of bacterial populations present in US-produced linerboard with high recycle content.
AB  - AIMS: To survey paperboard products from 17 US mills for bacterial populations and for bacteria potentially harmful to human health. METHODS AND RESULTS: Culturable aerobic bacteria were isolated from paperboard products using selective and nonselective medium. Resulting colonies from samples from three regions of the United States were identified using fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Percentages of bacteria species found were Bacillus megaterium (47), Bacillus licheniformis (15), Bacillus pumilus (12), Paenibacillus macerans (5), Paenibacillus pabuli (3), Bacillus subtilis (2), Bacillus cereus (2), Bacillus coagulans (1), Bacillus circulans (1), Bacillus brevis (1), Bacillus thuringiensis (1), Paenibacillus polymyxa (1), Cellulomonas turbata (1), Cellulomonas flavigena (1), unidentified Bacillus sp. (3) and unidentified bacteria (1). CONCLUSIONS: Recycled paperboard contained high populations of bacteria, and a positive correlation was found between recycle content and bacterial populations. Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella or confirmed coliform bacteria were not found in any product. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Populations of bacteria did not differ significantly from original counts over a 4-month period of dry storage, indicating that bacteria persist in paperboard over long periods and may re-enter the recycling process. The predominance of heat-tolerant endospore-forming bacteria explains the high bacteria counts found in paperboard made from recycled materials.
TI  - Lyngbyazothrins A-D, antimicrobial cyclic undecapeptides from the cultured Cyanobacterium lyngbya sp.
AB  - Four novel cyclic undecapeptides, lyngbyazothrins A (1), B (2), C (3), and D (4), were isolated from the cultured Lyngbya sp. 36.91 as binary mixtures (1/2 and 3/4). Their structures were elucidated by analysis of 1D (1H and 13C) and 2D (COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, NOESY, HMQC, and HMBC) NMR spectra, ESIMSMS, ESITOFMS, and amino acid analyses. Three unusual amino acids were present and identified as 4-methoxyhomophenylalanine in 1 and 3, homophenylalanine in 2 and 4, and 3-amino-2,5,7,8-tetrahydroxy-10-methylundecanoic acid (Aound) in all compounds, while 3 and 4 have an additional N-acetyl-N-methyltyrosine unit. The mixture of lyngbyazothrins A (1) and B (2) shows only low antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus flavus, whereas the mixture of lyngbyazothrins C (3) and D (4) was active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. It seems that the acyl residue at C-5 of the Aound unit plays an important role in antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Pre and post cloning characterization of a beta-1,4-endoglucanase from Bacillus sp.
AB  - Consistent with its precloning characterization from the cellulolytic Bacillus sp., beta-1,4-endoglucanase purified from the recombinant E. coli exhibited maximum activity at 60 degrees C and pH 7.0. It was highly specific for CMC hydrolysis, with stability up to 70 degrees C and over a pH range of 6.0-8.0. The K(m) and V(max) values for CMCase activity of the enzyme were 4.1 mg/ml and 25 micromole/ml min(-1), respectively. The purified enzyme was a monomer of 65 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE. The presence of sucrose and IPTG in fermentation media increased the endoglucanase activity of the recombinant enzyme to 5.2-folds as compared with that of the actual one.
TI  - Photodynamic treatment: a novel method for sanitation of food handling and food processing surfaces.
AB  - The photodynamic bactericidal effect of the photoactive dyes acriflavine neutral, rose bengal, phloxine B, and malachite green (oxalate salt) at concentrations of 5 to 5,000 microg/ml against two gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli LJH 128 and Salmonella Typhimurium C1058), two gram-positive strains (Bacillus sp. C578 and Listeria monocytogenes LJH 375), and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae C1172) was investigated. Incubation of the investigated bacteria with acriflavine neutral under illumination resulted in a significant reduction in cell numbers compared with dark incubation. Rose bengal caused a significant killing effect for bacteria incubated both in the dark and under illumination. Malachite green was active against gram-positive bacteria under illumination and did not affect gram-negative bacteria or yeasts. Incubation with phloxine B resulted in a significant decline in cell numbers for gram-positive bacteria, both in the dark and under illumination; gram-negative bacteria and yeasts were unaffected. Conjugation of rose bengal and phloxine B with poly(vinyl amine) resulted in an enhanced bactericidal effect during both dark and light incubation. This was explained by electrostatic interaction of the polymer with the cell surface, which resulted in closer contact of the photoactive dye and cell. No killing effect was observed for yeasts incubated with dye conjugates. Filter paper treated with dye-poly(vinyl amine) conjugates showed high photodynamic bactericidal activity against the bacterial strains, but not against the yeasts. The extent of bacterial killing depended on the nature and concentration of the dye conjugate and the type of microorganism. The presented data suggest that a photodynamic approach for constructing "self-decontaminating" materials has potential.
TI  - New thioureides of 2-(4-methylphenoxymethyl) benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro, by means of qualitative and quantative methods, the antimicrobial activity of some new synthesized chemical compounds previously solubilized in DMF (Dimethyl formamide). The qualitative screening of the susceptibility spectra of different microbial strains versus these compounds was performed by three adaptated diffusion methods: paper filter disk impregnation with the tested substances solutions, the disposal of tested solutions in agar wells and the spotting of tested solutions on solid medium previously inoculated with microbial suspension. The quantitative assay of the antimicrobial activity was performed by broth microdilution method in 96-well microplates in order to establish the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC).The antimicrobial activity was tested against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus) aureus sp., Bacillus subtilis sp.), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa sp., Klebsiella pneumonia sp.) and fungal strains (Candida albicans sp, Aspergillus nige rsp.). All tests were performed by comparison with the reference strains: K. pneumoniae IC 13420, E. coli IC 13529, S. aureus IC 13204, P. aeruginosa IC 13202, B. subtilis IC 12488, C. albicans IC 249, A. niger IC 13534. Our results indicated that the tested compounds exhibited specific antimicrobial activity, the highest activity being noticed against planktonic fungal cells (MIC ranging from 62.5 microg to 15.6 microg), followed by P. aeruginosa (MICs from 250 microg to 31.5 microg). Only few compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria was noticed for the most of the tested compounds, five of them exhibiting very low MIC values (MICs from 1000 microg to 62.5 microg).
TI  - Influence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on deposition kinetics of bacteria.
AB  - The significance of extracellular polymer substances (EPS) on cell deposition on  silica surfaces was examined by direct comparison of the deposition kinetics of untreated "intact" bacteria versus those from the same strain but with EPS removal via cation exchange resin (CER) treatment using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). Four bacterial strains, mutant Escherichia coli BL21 (gram-negative, nonmotile), Pseudomonas sp QG6 (gram-negative, motile), Rhodococcus sp QL2 (gram-positive, nonmotile), and Bacillus subtilis (gram-positive, motile), were employed to determine the influence of EPS on cell deposition. Experiments were conducted in both monovalent (NaCl) and divalent (CaCl2) solutions under a variety of environmentally relevant ionic strength ranging from 1 to 100 mM at pH 6.0. The effectiveness of EPS removal via CER method was ensured by biochemical composition analysis of EPS solutions and further confirmed by FTIR analysis. Comparable zeta potentials were observed for untreated and CER treated bacterial cells in both NaCl and CaCl2 solutions, indicating that removal of EPS from cell surfaces via CER treatment did not affect the electrokinetic properties of the cell surfaces for all four strains. However, observed deposition efficiencies (alpha) were greater for untreated cells relative to those with CER treated cells across the entire ionic strength range examined in both NaCI and CaCl2 solutions for all four bacterial strains. These results strongly demonstrated that the removal of EPS from cell surfaces for all four strains decreased the deposition of bacteria on silica surfaces. This study clearly showed that the enhancement of cell deposition on silica surfaces due to the presence of EPS on cell surfaces was relevant to all bacterial strains examined regardless of cell types and motility.
TI  - Enzymatic synthesis of 4-hydroxyphenyl beta-D-oligoxylosides and their notable tyrosinase inhibitory activity.
AB  - We have purified and characterized an oligoxylosyl transfer enzyme (OxtA) from Bacillus sp. strain KT12. In the present study, a N-terminally His-tagged recombinant form of the enzyme, OxtA(H)(E), was overproduced in Escherichia coli and applied to the reaction with xylan and hydroquinone to produce 4-hydroxyphenyl beta-D-oligoxylosides, beta-(Xyl)(n)-HQ (n=1-4), by one step reaction. The obtained beta-(Xyl)(n)-HQ inhibited mushroom tyrosinase, which catalyzes the oxidation of L-DOPA to L-DOPA quinine, and the IC(50) values of beta-Xyl-HQ, beta-(Xyl)(2)-HQ, beta-(Xyl)(3)-HQ, and beta-(Xyl)(4)-HQ were 3.0, 0.74, 0.48, and 0.18 mM respectively. beta-(Xyl)(4)-HQ showed 35-fold more potent inhibitory activity than beta-arbutin (4-hydroxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside), of which the IC(50) value was measured to be 6.3 mM. Kinetic analysis revealed that beta-(Xyl)(2)-HQ, beta-(Xyl)(3)-HQ, and beta-(Xyl)(4)-HQ competitively inhibited the enzyme, and the corresponding K(i) values were calculated to be 0.20, 0.29, and 0.057 mM respectively.
TI  - Substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  - Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. Here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal UGLs and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. The putative genes for UGL and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. The UGLs of these three streptococci were overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. Streptococcal UGLs degraded unsaturated hyaluronate and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately pH 5.5 and 37 degrees C. Distinct from Bacillus sp. GL1 UGL, streptococcal UGLs preferred sulfated substrates. DNA microarray and Western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in S. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. The crystal structure of S. agalactiae UGL (SagUGL) was determined at 1.75 A resolution by x-ray crystallography. SagUGL adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to Bacillus UGL, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. SagUGL Arg-236 was found to be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. This is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal UGLs.
TI  - Aureobasidin, new antifouling metabolite from marine-derived fungus Aureobasidium sp.
AB  - Two antifouling compounds, aureobasidin (1), a new ester with an unusual 4,6-dihydroxydecanoic acid residue, and (3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxydecanoic acid (2), were isolated from the marine-derived fungus Aureobasidium sp., in addition to (5R,3Z)-5-hydroxydec-3-enoic acid (3) and (R)-3-hydroxydecanoic acid (4). The structures were unambiguously established by IR, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic and mass spectral data. Compounds 1-3 were found to be active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Staphyllococcus aureus. Compound 3 showed fungistatic activity against Candida albicans.
TI  - The rapid evolution of signal peptides is mainly caused by relaxed selection on non-synonymous and synonymous sites.
AB  - The precursor of a secretory protein usually contains an N-terminal signal peptide (SP), which directs the protein to cross the membrane. We performed a genome-wide analysis of secretory proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and found that signal peptides evolved faster than mature proteins. To determine whether the evolutionary pattern could be explained by selective pressure changes, we studied the amino acid replacements in signal peptides. We found that they tend to be more conserved than those in mature regions of the proteins, suggesting relaxed selective pressure acting on non-synonymous sites. This is potentially explained by similar biochemical requirements of signal peptides. We also observed a decreased codon adaptation index (CAI), suggesting a relaxed purifying selection on synonymous sites of signal peptides. In addition, the evolutionary rate of signal sequences increases with codon usage bias, suggesting that increased rare codon frequency in signal peptides is a result of natural selection to improve secretion efficiency. Evidence also suggests signal peptides might have undergone positive selection. In summary, the evolution of signal peptides may be caused by a mixture of selection forces, primarily relaxation of purifying selection.
TI  - Ingestion of bacteria overproducing DnaK attenuates Vibrio infection of Artemia franciscana larvae.
AB  - Feeding of bacterially encapsulated heat shock proteins (Hsps) to invertebrates is a novel way to limit Vibrio infection. As an example, ingestion of Escherichia coli overproducing prokaryotic Hsps significantly improves survival of gnotobiotically cultured Artemia larvae upon challenge with pathogenic Vibrio campbellii. The relationship between Hsp accumulation and enhanced resistance to infection may involve DnaK, the prokaryotic equivalent to Hsp70, a major molecular chaperone in eukaryotic cells. In support of this proposal, heat-stressed bacterial strains LVS 2 (Bacillus sp.), LVS 3 (Aeromonas hydrophila), LVS 8 (Vibrio sp.), GR 8 (Cytophaga sp.), and GR 10 (Roseobacter sp.) were shown in this work to be more effective than nonheated bacteria in protecting gnotobiotic Artemia larvae against V. campbellii challenge. Immunoprobing of Western blots and quantification by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the amount of DnaK in bacteria and their ability to enhance larval resistance to infection by V. campbellii are correlated. Although the function of DnaK is uncertain, it may improve tolerance to V. campbellii via immune stimulation, a possibility of significance from a fundamental perspective and also because it could be applied in aquaculture, a major method of food production.
TI  - Antibody responses elicited in mice immunized with Bacillus subtilis vaccine strains expressing Stx2B subunit of enterohaemorragic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - No effective vaccine or immunotherapy is presently available for patients with the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) induced by Shiga-like toxin (Stx) produced by enterohaemorragic Escherichia coli (EHEC) strains, such as those belonging to the O157:H7 serotype. In this work we evaluated the performance of Bacillus subtilis strains, a harmless spore former gram-positive bacterium species, as a vaccine vehicle for the expression of Stx2B subunit (Stx2B). A recombinant B. subtilis vaccine strain expressing Stx2B under the control of a stress inducible promoter was delivered to BALB/c mice via oral, nasal or subcutaneous routes using both vegetative cells and spores. Mice immunized with vegetative cells by the oral route developed low but specific anti-Stx2B serum IgG and fecal IgA responses while mice immunized with recombinant spores developed anti-Stx2B responses only after administration via the parenteral route. Nonetheless, serum anti-Stx2B antibodies raised in mice immunized with the recombinant B. subtilis strain did not inhibit the toxic effects of the native toxin, both under in vitro and in vivo conditions, suggesting that either the quantity or the quality of the induced immune response did not support an effective neutralization of Stx2 produced by EHEC strains.
TI  - Expression, characterization and synergistic interactions of Myxobacter Sp. AL-1  Cel9 and Cel48 glycosyl hydrolases.
AB  - The soil microorganism Myxobacter Sp. AL-1 regulates in a differential manner the production of five extracellular cellulases during its life cycle. The nucleotide sequence of a cel9-cel48 cluster from the genome of this microorganism was recently obtained. Cel48 was expressed in Escherichia coli to generate a His(6)-Cel48 protein and the biochemical properties of the pure protein were determined. Cel48 was more efficient in degrading acid-swollen avicel (ASC) than carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). On the other hand, cel9 was expressed in Bacillus subtilis from an IPTG-inducible promoter. Zymogram analysis showed that after IPTG-induction, Cel9 existed in both the cell fraction and the culture medium of B. subtilis and the secreted protein was purified to homogeneity by FPLC-ionic exchange chromatography. The exocellobiohydrolase Cel48 showed a synergism of 1.68 times with the endocellulase Cel9 during ASC degradation using an 8.1-fold excess of Cel48 over Cel9. Western blot analysis revealed that both proteins were synthesized and secreted to the culture medium of Myxobacter Sp. AL-1. These results show that the cel9-cel48 cluster encodes functional endo- and exo-acting cellulases that allows Myobacter Sp. AL-1 to hydrolyse cellulose.
TI  - Nagelamides Q and R, novel dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids from sponges Agelas sp.
AB  - Two new dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids, nagelamides Q (1) and R (2), have been isolated from Okinawan marine sponges of the genus Agelas (SS-1134 and SS-956, respectively), and the structures and stereochemistry were elucidated from spectroscopic data. Nagelamide Q (1) is a rare dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloid possessing a pyrrolidine ring, while nagelamide R (2) is the first bromopyrrole alkaloid having an oxazoline ring. Nagelamides Q (1) and R (2) showed antimicrobial activity.
TI  - A novel endo-glucanase from the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus sp. 70PC53 with high activity and stability over a broad range of temperatures.
AB  - A thermophilic Geobacillus bacterium secreting high activity of endo-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) was isolated from rice straw compost supplemented with pig manure. A full-length gene of 1,104 bp, celA, encoding this glycosyl hydrolase family 5 endo-glucanase of 368 amino acids was isolated. No related gene from Geobacillus has been reported previously. The recombinant CelA expressed in Escherichia coli had an optimal activity at 65 degrees C and pH 5.0, and it exhibited tenfold greater specific activity than the commercially available Trichoderma reesei endo-glucanase. CelA displayed activity over a broad temperature range from 45 to 75 degrees C and was a thermostable enzyme with 90% activity retained after heating at 65 degrees C for 6 h. Interestingly, CelA activity could be enhanced by 100% in the presence of 2 mM MnSO(4). CelA had high specific activity over beta-D-glucan from barley and Lichenan, making it a potentially useful enzyme in biofuel and food industries.
TI  - Antioxidant enzyme activity in bacterial resistance to nicotine toxicity by reactive oxygen species.
AB  - We analyzed superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ATPase activities in  the highly nicotine-degrading strain Pseudomonas sp. HF-1 and two standard strains Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis in an attempt to understand antioxidant enzymes in bacteria are produced in response to nicotine, which increases the virulence of the bacteria. Nicotine had different effects on different antioxidant enzymes of different bacteria. SOD plays a more important role in resistance to nicotine stress in E. coli than it does in CAT. Multiple antioxidant enzymes are involved in combating oxidative stress caused by nicotine in Pseudomonas sp. HF-1. The contribution of a particular antioxidant enzyme for protection from nicotine stress varies with the growth phase involved. The inhibition of ATPase in Pseudomonas sp. HF-1 at the stationary phase was enhanced with increasing nicotine concentration, showing a striking dose-response relationship. Nicotine probably affected the metabolism of ATP to some extent. Furthermore, different bacteria possessed distinct SOD isoforms to cope with oxidative stress caused by nicotine.
TI  - Characterization and identification of a novel marine Streptomyces sp. produced antibacterial substance.
AB  - Strain GB-2 is a marine microbe with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, isolated from soil taken from the coastal city Lianyungang in the JiangSu province of China. Analysis of its morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics as well as chemical components of the cell wall strongly suggested that the strain GB-2 belonged to the Streptomyces sp. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of Streptomyces sp. GB-2 strain showed a strong similarity (98%) with the 16 rRNA gene of Streptomyces fradiae. Application to antibacterial substance of strain Streptomyces sp. GB-2 by various separation steps led to isolation of one active molecule having a retention time of 9.495 min, P(9.495 min), which possessed antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Through analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and mass/mass spectrometry of the peak, the molecular weight of the antibacterial substance (P(9.495 min) sample) was 447.5 Da and it was determined to be sisomicin according to the analysis of ion fragments. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the peak also demonstrated that the antibacterial substance was sisomicin. This study is the first to introduce the finding of sisomicin produced from marine Streptomyces sp. This work provides a preference for the production of sisomicin in pharmaceutical industries and a probability for studying the biodiversity of marine microbe.
TI  - Identification and cloning of a gene encoding dichloromethane dehalogenase from a methylotrophic bacterium, Bacillus circulans WZ-12 CCTCC M 207006.
AB  - The gene dehalA encoding a novel dichloromethane dehalogenases (DehalA), has been cloned from Bacillus circulans WZ-12 CCTCC M 207006. The open reading frame of dehalA, spanning 864 bp, encoded a 288-amino acid protein that showed 85.76% identity to the dichloromethane dehalogenases of Hyphomicrobium sp. GJ21 with several commonly conserved sequences. These sequences could not be found in putative dichloromethane (DCM) dehalogenases reported from other bacteria and fungi. DehalA was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) from a pET28b(+) expression system and purified. The subunit molecular mass of the recombinant DehalA as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was approximately 33 kDa. Subsequent enzymatic characterization revealed that DehalA was most active in a acidic pH range at 30 degrees , which was quite different from that observed from a facultative bacterium dichloromethane dehalogenases of Methylophilus sp. strain DM11. The Michaelis-Menten constant of DCM dehalogenase was markedly lower than that of standard DCM dehalogenases.
TI  - Role of chitin binding domain of chitinase A of Streptomyces cyaneus SP-27 in protoplast formation from Schizophyllum commune.
AB  - Chitinase A (CHIA) of Streptomyces cyaneus SP-27 forms protoplasts from Schizophyllum commune mycelia when it is combined with alpha-1,3-glucanase of Bacillus circulans KA-304. An N-terminal chitin-binding domain truncated mutant (CatCHIA), which was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami B (DE 3), lost most of its colloidal chitin- and powder chitin-binding activity. The colloidal chitin-hydrolyzing, the powder chitin-hydrolyzing, and the protoplast-forming activities of CatCHIA were lower than those of CHIA, suggesting that the chitin-binding domain contributes to the hydrolysis of chitin in the cell-wall of S. commune.
TI  - Identification of the csp gene and molecular modelling of the CspA-like protein from Antarctic soil-dwelling psychrotrophic bacterium Psychrobacter sp. B6.
AB  - We cloned and sequenced the cspA-like gene from a psychrotrophic Antarctic soil-dwelling bacterial strain Psychrobacter sp. B6. The gene is 213 bp long and shows 99% and 98% sequence identity with the Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5 gene encoding a cold-shock DNA-binding domain protein and the Psychrobacter arcticus transcriptional regulator-CspA gene, respectively. The protein encoded by the Psychrobacter sp. B6 cspA-like gene shows 100% identity with the two proteins mentioned above, and also 61% sequence identity with CspB from Bacillus subtilis and Csp from Bacillus caldolyticus, and 56% - with Escherichia coli CspA protein. A three-dimensional model of the CspA-like protein from Psychrobacter sp. B6 was generated based on three known structures of cold shock proteins: the crystal structure of the major cold shock protein from Escherichia coli (CspA), the NMR structure of the latter protein, and the NMR structure of Csp from Thermotoga maritima. The deduced structure of the CspA-like protein from Psychrobacter sp. B6 was found to be very similar to these known structures of Csp-like proteins.
TI  - Mansoquinone: isolation and structure elucidation of new antibacterial aromatic polyketides from terrestrial Streptomyces Sp. Eg5.
AB  - The cultivation of terrestrial Streptomyces Sp. Eg5 delivered two new aromatic polyketides, 2-butyryl-1,8-dihydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone (2), or mansoquinone, and 2-acetyl-1,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-anthra-quinone (3) along with the known 2-ethyl-1,8-dihydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone (1). The structure of mansoquinone (2) was elucidated using detailed spectral ((1)H and (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, HSQC, HMBC and HRMS) analysis. This is the first report of the isolation of 3 from natural source. Mansoquinone (2) exhibited moderate antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some macrophytes from Lake Manzalah (Egypt).
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of aqueous and organic solvents (chloroform, ethanol and methanol) extracts of four plants Ceratophyllum demersum L., Eichhornia crassipes, Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton pectinatus were tested in vitro against seventeen different microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Nine of these identified organisms were obtained from different sources, Bacillus subtilis 1020, Bacillus cereus 1080, Staphylococcus aureus, Erwinia carotovora NCPPB 312, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium italicum. The other eight organisms were isolated from Manzalah lake water and identified using API 20E strip system (BioMereux). One hundred pathogenic bacterial isolates representing eight genera were identified to species level. These organisms are Escherichia coli (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Salmonella colerasuis (13%), Shigella sp. (11%), Serratia liquefaciens (10%), Proteus vulgaris (9%) and Brenneria nigrifluens (7%). The extracts of all tested plants demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the used organisms. The efficiency of the extracts varied with, solvent used in the extraction as well as plant species and the part of plant used. The aqueous extract appeared to be the highly effective extract against all tested organisms especially Fusarium oxysporum causing inhibition zone 48 +/- 0.01 mm, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 59 +/- 0.02 mm and Salmonella cholerasuis 55 +/- 0.01 mm when using P. crispus, P. pectinatus and C. demersum, respectively. Ethanol extracts of C. demersum, P. crispus and E. crassipes root showed antimicrobial activities against all tested organisms except Aspergillus niger. At the same time the extract of P. pectinatus had no effect also on Fusarium oxysporum and the extract of E. crassipes leaves have no effect on Penicillium italicum. On using chloroform extracts Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium italicum showed resistance. Comparing the effect of different plants extracts C. demersum appeared to be the most effective followed by P. pectinatus. Furthermore, the extracts of E. crassipes leaves being more effective than that, of its roots. Elemental analysis were also takes place in water and plant samples and the results revealed the presence of Mn and Pb in higher concentration in P. pectinatus (Mn 603 +/- 4.243 ppm and Pb 44 +/- 2.828 ppm), at the same time the highest values of Fe 1680 +/- 2.2 ppm, Zn 31.5 +/- 2.1 ppm and Cu 26.5 +/- 2.1 ppm were recorded for C. demersum. Comparing the two parts of E. crassipes (leaves and roots), the roots have the highest values of all studied metals.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and overexpression of thermophilic pectate lyase  of Bacillus sp. RN1 isolated from a hot spring in Thailand.
AB  - A thermophilic pectate lyase, Pel SWU, was isolated from a culture filtrate of Bacillus sp. RN1 isolated from a hot spring in Ranong Province, Thailand. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity using cation-exchange and hydrophobic column chromatographies. The molecular mass of Pel SWU was estimated to be 33 kDa. The specific substrate was demethylated galacturonic acid. The enzyme was stable at pH 4.0-10.0 and at temperatures up to 70 degrees C in the presence of calcium and polygalacturonic acid (PGA). The optimum pH and temperature were 10.0 and 90 degrees C. The pel gene encoding Pel SWU was 1,023 bp, which corresponds to 341 amino acids. The properties of the recombinant enzyme was similar to those of Bacillus Pel SWU. Unsaturated di- and trigalacturonic acids were formed mainly as the final products of degradation by Pel SWU, as revealed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analyses. This thermophilic pectate lyase should be useful in the degradation of pectin networks at high temperature.
TI  - Spontaneous fermentation of traditional sago starch in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Sago starch is an important dietary carbohydrate in lowland Papua New Guinea (PNG). An investigation was conducted to determine whether microbes play a role in its preservation using traditional methods. In 12 stored sago samples collected from PNG villages, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were present (> or = 3.6 x 10(4)cfu/g) and pH ranged from 6.8 to 4.2. Acetic and propionic acids were detected in all samples, while butyric, lactic and valeric acids were present in six or more. In freshly prepared sago, held in sealed containers in the laboratory at 30 degrees C, spontaneous fermentation by endogenous microflora of sago starch was observed. This was evident by increasing concentrations of acetic, butyric and lactic acids over 4 weeks, and pH reducing from 4.9 to 3.1: both LAB and yeasts were involved. Survival of potential bacterial pathogens was monitored by seeding sago starch with approximately 10(4)/g of selected organisms. Numbers of Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus fell to < 30/g within 7 days. Salmonella sp. was present only in low numbers after 7 days (< 36/g), but Escherichia coli was still detectable after three weeks (> 10(2)/g). Fermentation appeared to increase the storability and safety of the product.
TI  - Macrolactin S, a new antibacterial agent with FabG-inhibitory activity from Bacillus sp. AT28.
AB  - In the course of screening for FabG inhibitors from microbial sources, a new 24-membered ring lactone named macrolactin S, along with the known compound macrolactin B, has been isolated from the mycelium of liquid fermentation cultures of Bacillus sp. AT28. The structure of macrolactin S was determined on the basis of MS and NMR data. Macrolactin S showed a dose-dependent inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus FabG, not inhibiting S. aureus FabI. Also macrolactin S inhibited the growth of S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Efficiency of KrCl excilamp (222 nm) for inactivation of bacteria in suspension.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the killing efficiency of UV KrCl excilamp against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes at initial populations from 10(2) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) ml(-1) were treated by KrCl excilamp in sterile Ringer's solution with and without H(2)O(2). The number of viable cells was determined using spread plating techniques and nutrient agar method with subsequent incubation at 28 degrees C or 37 degrees C for 24 h. At estimated populations of 10(2)-10(5) CFU ml(-1) E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive and showed 100% disinfection within 15 s (29.2 mJ cm(-2)). Bacillus subtilis was more sensitive to UV treatment than B. cereus. The UV/H(2)O(2) inactivation rate coefficients within this population range were two times higher than those observed for UV treatment alone. No effect of H(2)O(2) was observed at 10(7) CFU ml(-1) for Bacillus sp. and Strep. pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The narrow-band UV radiation at 222 nm was effective in the rapid disinfection of bacteria in aqueous suspensions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: KrCl excilamps represent UV sources which can be applied for disinfection of drinking water in advanced oxidation processes.
TI  - Microbial burden of some herbal antimalarials marketed at Elele, Rivers State.
AB  - Herbal antimalarials still remain an alternative to our traditional communities who can not afford orthodox antimalarials. This study was aimed at investigating the microbial quality of six herbal antimalarials using standard microbiological methods. Of the six preparations analyzed, "schnapps", palm wine and water were the media of preparation; the water base preparations recorded higher microbial load. The mean microbial load was 159.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml and 217.4 x 10(2)cfu/ml in water and alcohol base preparations respectively. The microbial profile of the preparations showed that the schnapps base preparations were predominantly contaminated with Bacillus sp (Aerobic spore bearers) and Mucor spp. The palm wine preparation harboured Bacillus sp, yeasts and Mucor spp while the water base preparations had several isolates such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli 0157H7, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus feacalis, Serratia marcensces, Staph. aureus, Bacillus spp and Mucor spp. Conclusively, this study underlines the public health importance of these preparations given the high burden of such human pathogen as Ecoli O157H7, Ps aeruginosa, Stahp aureus, etc. in the preparations.
TI  - Myxotyrosides A and B, Unusual rhamnosides from Myxococcus sp.
AB  - Myxobacteria are gliding bacteria of the delta-subdivision of the Proteobacteria  and known for their unique biosynthetic capabilities. Two examples of a new class of metabolites, myxotyrosides A (1) and B (2), were isolated from a Myxococcus sp. The myxotyrosides have a tyrosine-derived core structure glycosylated with rhamnose and acylated with unusual fatty acids such as (Z)-15-methyl-2-hexadecenoic and (Z)-2-hexadecenoic acid. The fatty acid profile of the investigated Myxococcus sp. (strain 131) is that of a typical myxobacterium with a high similarity to those described for M. fulvus and M. xanthus, with significant concentrations of neither 15-methyl-2-hexadecenoic acid nor 2-hexadecenoic acid being detected.
TI  - Phylogenetic diversity and antimicrobial activities of fungi associated with Haliclona simulans isolated from Irish coastal waters.
AB  - The diversity and antimicrobial activities of 80 fungi isolated from Haliclona simulans were assessed using different fungal media containing either agar or gellum gum. In total, 19 different genotypes were detected. These fungal isolates could be classified as members of the Agaricomycotina, Mucoromycotina, Saccharomycotina, and Pezizomycotina, although the majority of the isolates were associated with the latter class. Some of these fungal isolates showed antimicrobial inhibition of Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida glabrata. Fungal 18S rRNA gene sequences belonging to Eurotiales, Calosphaeriales, and Chaetothyriales were amplified from DNA and RNA extracted from this marine sponge. This study indicates that in contrast to the low diversity of fungi detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR amplification from extracts of this marine sponge, a much higher diversity of fungi could be cultured. The data suggests that some fungi live in symbiosis with H. simulans, whereas other fungi may have been ingested from the surrounding seawater.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - Inhibition of growth of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli by nonpathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - During routine quality control testing of diagnostic methods for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) using stool samples spiked with STEC, it was observed that the Shiga toxin could not be detected in 32 out of 82 samples tested. Strains of E. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. One particular isolate, named E. coli 1307, was intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and Shiga toxin levels in coculture of several STEC strains regardless of serovar or Shiga toxin type. The probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced Shiga toxin levels in STEC cultures to an extent similar to E. coli 1307, but commensal E. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. Escherichia coli 1307 lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria. We therefore propose strain E. coli 1307 as a candidate probiotic for use in the prevention and treatment of infections caused by STEC.
TI  - Engineering of the alpha-amylase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus US100 for detergent incorporation.
AB  - AmyUS100DeltaIG is a variant of the most thermoactive and thermostable maltohexaose forming alpha-amylase produced by Geobacillus stearothermophilus sp.US100. This enzyme which was designed to improve the thermostability of the wild-type enzyme has acquired a very high resistance to chelator agents. According to modeling structural studies and with the aim of enhancing its resistance towards chemical oxidation, a mutant (AmyUS100DeltaIG/M197A) was created by substituting methionine 197 to alanine. The catalytic proprieties of the resulting mutant show alterations in the specific activity and the profile of starch hydrolysis. Interestingly, AmyUS100DeltaIG/M197A displayed the highest resistance to oxidation compared to the AmyUS100DeltaIG and to Termamyl300, the well-known commercial amylase used in detergent. Further, performance of the engineered alpha-amylase was estimated in the presence of commonly used detergent compounds and a wide range of commercial detergent (liquid and solid). These studies indicated a high compatibility and performance of AmyUS100DeltaIG/M197A, suggesting its potential application in detergent industry.
TI  - Artificial plasmid engineered to simulate multiple biological threat agents.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a non-virulent simulant to replace several virulent organisms during the development of detection and identification methods for biological threat agents. We identified and selected specific genes to detect Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Rickettsia sp., Coxiella burnetii, Brucella sp., enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, Bacillus anthracis, and variola (smallpox) virus. We then designed and engineered a non-infectious simulant that included the nucleic-acid signature of each microorganism in a single chimerical molecule. Here, we reported an approach that by direct (de novo) chemical synthesis permitted the production of a single chimerical construct 2,040 bp long that included the nucleic-acid signature of the bacterial and viral biological threat agents listed above without requiring access to these agents. Sequences corresponding to each one of the biological agents in the synthetic simulant were amplified by PCR, resulting in amplicons of the expected length, of similar intensity, and without any detectable unspecific products. The novel simulant described here could reduce the need for infectious agents in the development of detection and diagnostic methods and should also be useful as a non-virulent positive control in nucleic-acid-based tests against biological threat agents.
TI  - Endophytic actinomycetes from Azadirachta indica A. Juss.: isolation, diversity,  and anti-microbial activity.
AB  - Endophytic actinomycetes from Azadirachta indica A. Juss. were screened and evaluated for their anti-microbial activity against an array of pathogenic fungi and bacteria. A total of 55 separate isolates were obtained from 20 plants, and 60% of these showed inhibitory activity against one or more pathogenic fungi and bacteria. Actinomycetes were most commonly recovered from roots (54.5% of all isolates), followed by stems (23.6%), and leaves (21.8%). The dominant genus was Streptomyces (49.09% of all isolates), while Streptosporangium (14.5%), Microbispora (10.9%), Streptoverticillium (5.5%), Sacchromonospora sp. (5.5%), and Nocardia (3.6%) were also recovered. Streptomyces isolates AzR 006, 011, and 031 (all from roots) had acute activity against Pseudomonas fluorescens, while AzR027, 032, and 051 (also all from roots) showed activity against Escherichia coli. Meanwhile, an isolate of Nocardia sp. from leaves (AzL025) showed antagonism against Bacillus subtilis. Overall, 32 of the 55 were found to have broad spectrum significant antimicrobial activity, while about 4% of them showed strong and acute inhibition to pathogenic fungi and bacteria. Isolates of Streptomyces AzR031, 008, and 047, Nocardia sp. AzL025, and Streptosporangium sp. AzR 021 and 048 are of particular interest because they showed significant antagonistic activity against root pathogens, including Pythium and Phytophthora sp. Thus, many of the isolates recovered from A. indica in this study may be used in developing potential bio-control agents against a range of pathogenic fungi and bacteria and in the production of novel natural antimicrobial compounds. These results not only further our understanding of plant-microbe interactions but also indicate that there is an untapped resource of endophytic microorganisms that could be exploited in the biotechnological, medicinal, and agricultural industries.
TI  - Diversity of root associated microorganisms of selected medicinal plants and influence of rhizomicroorganisms on the antimicrobial property of Coriandrum sativum.
AB  - The total heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes and fungus were enumerated from the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil of 50 selected locally available medicinal plants in and around Bharathiar University. In all the plants, population of microorganism were higher in the rhizosphere soil than in the non rhizosphere soil. Among the microorganisms, bacterial population was higher in number followed by fungus and actinomycetes. Of the medicinal plants, the maximum rhizosphere effect was observed in Annona squamosa and the minimum effect was seen in Eclipta alba and Cassia auriculata. Among the bacteria the dominant species was Bacillus followed by Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Corynebacterium, Micrococcus and Serratia. The Streptomyces species was found to be dominant followed by Deuteromycetes and Frankia among the actinomycetes. Among the fungal isolates Rhizopus was found to be higher in number followed by Aspergillus, Penicillium, Mucor and Fusarium. About 70.96% of the bacterial isolates were found to be nitrate reducers and 90.60% of the bacteria solubilised phosphate. The rhizosphere bacterial isolates were also capable of hydrolyzing starch, cellulose, casein, urea and gelatin. The isolates of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungus were also able to produce phytohormone Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The maximum IAA production was recorded by Fusarium sp (5.8 mg/l). The rhizosphere bacterial isolates showed resistance to 14 commercially used antibiotics. In an attempt to check the influence of these plant growth promoting microorganisms on the antimicrobial property of Coriandrum sativum against Escherichia coli MTCC-443 and Aeromonas hydrophila MTCC-646, the results observed was not encouraging since the inoculants did not influence the antibacterial property. However extensive and in depth study is required to find out the influence of rhizomicroorganisms on the antibacterial property of medicinal plants. The other results clearly indicated that the rhizosphere microorganisms could be exploited for its innumerable properties and active metabolites.
TI  - Growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. Long-term Acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including S. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the bacterium given, being much higher with E. coli, M. luteus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Cloning, extracellular expression and characterization of a predominant beta-CGTase from Bacillus sp. G1 in E. coli.
AB  - The cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) gene from Bacillus sp.  G1 was successfully isolated and cloned into Escherichia coli. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of an open reading frame of 2,109 bp and encoded a 674 amino acid protein. Purified CGTase exhibited a molecular weight of 75 kDa and had optimum activity at pH 6 and 60 degrees C. Heterologous recombinant protein expression in E. coli is commonly problematic causing intracellular localization and formation of inactive inclusion bodies. This paper shows that the majority of CGTase was secreted into the medium due to the signal peptide of Bacillus sp. G1 that also works well in E. coli, leading to easier purification steps. When reacted with starch, CGTase G1 produced 90% beta-cyclodextrin (CD) and 10% gamma-CD. This enzyme also preferred the economical tapioca starch as a substrate, based on kinetics studies. Therefore, CGTase G1 could potentially serve as an industrial enzyme for the production of beta-CD.
TI  - Antiprotozoal activities of heterocyclic-substituted xanthones from the marine-derived fungus Chaetomium sp.
AB  - Investigations of the marine-derived fungus Chaetomium sp. led to the isolation of the new natural products chaetoxanthones A, B, and C (1-3). Compounds 1 and 2 are substituted with a dioxane/tetrahydropyran moiety rarely found in natural products. Compound 3 was identified as a chlorinated xanthone substituted with a tetrahydropyran ring. The configurational analysis of these compounds employed CD spectroscopy, modified Mosher's method, and selective NOE gradient measurements. Compound 2 showed selective activity against Plasmodium falciparum with an IC50 value of 0.5 microg/mL without being cytotoxic toward cultured eukaryotic cells. Compound 3 displayed a moderate activity against Trypanosoma cruzi with an IC50 value of 1.5 microg/mL.
TI  - [Investigation on species composition of cockroaches and bacteria-carrying on their bodies in five cities of Hainan].
AB  - "ZA-type" cages were used to capture cockroaches in 267 sites of 5 cities in Hainan. Species were identified and bacteria were isolated by routine method. 441 cockroaches were collected and identified as five species belonging to two genera, 75.3% being Periplaneta americana. More cockroaches were found in sewerage. Bacteria were detected from 82.4% of cockroaches, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sp, Bacillus proteus and sort of mycetes. Therefore, the dominant species is Periplaneta americana in Hainan, and the high bacteria-carrying behavior of cockroaches indicates its importance in disease transmission.
TI  - Characterization of cold-active uracil-DNA glycosylase from Bacillus sp. HJ171 and its use for contamination control in PCR.
AB  - In this study, the gene encoding Bacillus sp. HJ171 uracil-DNA glycosylase (Bsp HJ171 UDG) was cloned and sequenced. The Bsp HJ171 UDG gene consists of a 738-bp DNA sequence, which encodes for a protein that is 245-amino-acid residues in length. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Bsp HJ171 UDG had a high sequence similarity with other bacterial UDGs. The molecular mass of the protein derived from this amino acid sequence was 27.218 kDa. The Bsp HJ171 UDG gene was expressed under the control of a T7lac promoter in the pTYB1 plasmid in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The expressed enzyme was purified in one step using the Intein Mediated Purification with an Affinity Chitin-binding Tag purification system. The optimal temperature range, pH, NaCl concentration, and KCl concentration of the purified enzyme was 20-25 degrees C, 8.0, 25 and 25 mM, respectively. The half-life of the enzyme at 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C were approximately 131 and 45 s, respectively. These heat-labile characteristics enabled Bsp HJ171 UDG to control carry-over contamination in the polymerase chain reaction product (PCR) without losing the PCR product.
TI  - Cloning and expression of chitinase A gene from Streptomyces cyaneus SP-27: the enzyme participates in protoplast formation of Schizophyllum commune.
AB  - Chitinase A of Streptomyces cyaneus SP-27 or chitinase I of Bacillus circulans KA-304 showed the protoplast-forming activity when combined with alpha-1,3-glucanase of B. circulans KA-304. The gene of chitinase A was cloned. It consisted of 903 nucleotides encoding 301 amino acid residues, including a putative signal peptide (35 amino acid residues). The deduced N-terminal moiety of chitinase A showed sequence homology with the chitin-binding domain of chitinase F from Streptomyces coelicolor and chitinase 30 from Streptomyces olivaceoviridisis. The C-terminal moiety also showed high sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of several Streptomyces family 19 chitinases as well as that of chitinase I of B. circulans KA-304. Recombinant chitinase A was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami B (DE 3). The properties of the recombinant enzyme were almost the same as those of chitinase A purified from a culture filtrate of S. cyaneus SP-27. The recombinant enzyme was superior to B. circulans KA-304 chitinase I not only in respect to protoplast forming activity in a mixture containing alpha-1,3-glucanase, but also to antifungal activity and powder chitin-hydrolyzing activity.
TI  - Three new antimicrobial metabolites of Phomopsis sp.
AB  - Two new 10-membered macrolides, named Phomolides A (1) and B (2), and one new derivative of benzofuran (3) were isolated from the culture of Phomopsis sp. hzla01-1, and their structures were elucidated based on spectroscopic analyses, particularly 2D NMR experiments. Compounds 1, 2 and 3 showed significant antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli CMCC44103, Candida albicans AS2.538, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC9763 with MICs 5~10 mug/ml. The most significant, compound 3 showed strong activity against Bacillus subtilis CMCC63501 with the MIC value 1.25 microg/ml. None of the three compounds showed significant cytotoxicity against the HeLa cell line at 10 microg/ml.
TI  - Cloning and expression of Bacillus phytase gene (phy) in Escherichia coli and recovery of active enzyme from the inclusion bodies.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate, clone and express a novel phytase gene (phy) from Bacillus sp.  in Escherichia coli; to recover the active enzyme from inclusion bodies; and to characterize the recombinant phytase. METHODS AND RESULTS: The molecular weight of phytase was estimated as 40 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A requirement of Ca(2+) ions was found essential both for refolding and activity of the enzyme. Bacillus phytase exhibited a specific activity of 16 U mg(-1) protein; it also revealed broad pH and temperature ranges of 5.0 to 8.0 and 25 to 70 degrees C, respectively. The K(m) value of phytase for hydrolysis of sodium phytate has been determined as 0.392 mmol l(-1). The activity of enzyme has been inhibited by EDTA. The enzyme exhibited ample thermostability upon exposure to high temperatures from 75 to 95 degrees C. After 9 h of cultivation of transformed E. coli in the bioreactor, the cell biomass reached 26.81 g wet weight (ww) per l accounting for 4289 U enzyme activity compared with 1.978 g ww per l producing 256 U activity in shake-flask cultures. In silico analysis revealed a beta-propeller structure of phytase. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of its kind on the purification and successful in vitro refolding of Bacillus phytase from the inclusion bodies formed in the transformed E. coli. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Efficient and reproducible protocols for cloning, expression, purification and in vitro refolding of Bacillus phytase enzyme from the transformed E. coli have been developed. The novel phytase, with broad pH and temperature range, renaturation ability and substrate specificity, appears promising as an ideal feed supplement. Identification of site between 179th amino acid leucine and 180th amino acid asparagine offers scope for insertion of small peptides/domains for production of chimeric genes without altering enzyme activity.
TI  - [Cloning and expression of a beta-glucosidase gene umcel3G from metagenome of buffalo rumen and characterization of the translated product].
AB  - Metagenomic cosmid libraries containing 1.26 x 10(5) clones, covering about 4.8 x 10(6) kb metagenomic DNA of uncultured microorganisms from the contents of buffalo rumens were constructed, and 118 independent clones expressing beta-glucosidase activity were isolated from the libraries. Screening of these clones showed that eight clones expressed relatively higher beta-glucosidase activity at pH 5.0 and 37 degrees C. One out of the eight clones was subcloned. Sequencing analysis showed that an open reading frame (ORF) of 2223 bp, termed umcel3G, potentially encodes a beta-glucosidase. The encoded product shared highest homology with a beta-glucosidase from Bacillus sp. at 60% identity and 73% similarity. The umcel3G was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and the size of the translated product Umcel3G on SDS-PAGE was in agreement with the predicted molecular mass. Zymogram analysis showed that Umcel3G exhibited beta-glucosidase activity, confirming that this ORF encodes a beta-glucosidase. The Umcel3G, purified with Ni-NTA column, exhibited optimal activity at pH 6.0-6.5 and 45 degrees C. Certain ions such as Ca2+, Zn2+ had significant positive effect on the activity of Umcel3G. However, some ions such as Fe3+, Cu2+ gave significant inhibitory effect on the enzyme. The Ni-NTA purified recombinant beta-glucosidase Umcel3G had a specific activity of 22.8 IU/mg at pH4.5, 35 degrees C and at the presence of 5 mmol/L Ca2+, indicating that this enzyme has potential applications in the fermentative production of ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation (SSCF) of lignocelluloses.
TI  - New mono- and dimeric members of the secalonic acid family: blennolides A-G isolated from the fungus Blennoria sp.
AB  - Blennolides A-G (2-8), seven unusual chromanones, were isolated together with secalonic acid B (1) from Blennoria sp., an endophytic fungus from Carpobrotus edulis. This is the first reported isolation of the blennolides 2 and 3 (hemisecalonic acids B and E), the existence of which as the monomeric units of the dimeric secalonic acids had long been postulated. A compound of the proposed structure 4 (beta-diversonolic ester) will need to be revised, as its reported data do not fit those of the established structure of blennolide C (4). Other monomers, the blennolides D-F (5-7) seem to be derived from blennolides A (2) and B (3) by rearrangement of the hydroaromatic ring. The heterodimer 8, composed of the monomeric blennolide A (2) and the rearranged 11-dehydroxy derivative of blennolide E (6), extends the ergochrome family with an ergoxanthin type of skeleton. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis and further confirmed by an X-ray diffraction study of a single crystal of 2. The absolute configurations were determined by TDDFT calculations of CD spectra, including the solid-state CD/TDDFT approach. Preliminary studies showed strong antifungal and antibacterial activities of these compounds against Microbotryum violaceum and Bacillus megaterium, respectively. They were also active against the alga Chlorella fusca and the bacterium Escherichia coli.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and transglycosylation reaction of Paenibacillus sp. strain  W-61 xylanase 1.
AB  - A xylanase gene, xyn1, which encodes Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 xylanase 1 (Xyn1), was cloned in Escherichia coli. xyn1 encodes 211 amino acid residues, including 28 amino acid residues of a signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature Xyn1 showed 95.7%, 84.0%, and 83.7% identity to family 11 xylanases of Aeromonas caviae ME-1, Paenibacillus sp., and Bacillus stearothermophilus respectively. The physico-chemical properties of recombinant Xyn1 were very similar to those of intact Xyn1, except for the molecular mass. The pattern of xylooligosaccharides generated by rXyn1 was investigated by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE). The degradation rate of xylohexaose by rXyn1 increased markedly as compared with that of xylopentaose. Xylohexaose had a single preferential point of cleavage by rXyn1. On the basis of the pattern of action of xylooligosaccharides, the number of subsites was estimated to be six. The catalytic site was located between the third and the fourth subsites from non-reducing end.
TI  - Properties of the reversible nonoxidative vanillate/4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051) reversibly decarboxylates vanillate and 4-hydroxybenzoate under both aerobic and anoxic conditions. Thus, we have identified on the basis of gene sequence homology with Sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus and Streptomyces sp. strain D7, a putative B. subtilis hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase. The native form of this enzyme is encoded by 3 genes yclBCD (GI Sequence Identification Nos.: 2632649, 2632650, 2632651) that we have renamed during this research as bsdBCD to align with existing nomenclature. The bsdD gene is reported in the database to be 690 bp; however, our sequence analysis revealed that the size of this gene is in fact 228 bp, an observation that results in a shortening of YclD (i.e., BsdD) from 229 to 75 aa. The corresponding bsdBCD genes were cloned into Escherichia coli, and the heterologously expressed enzyme was assayed for activity. The decarboxylase exhibited a narrow substrate range, with only 2 of the tested substrates, vanillate (Kmapp = 4 mmol.L-1) and 4-hydroxybenzoate (Kmapp = ~1 mmol.L-1), being decarboxylated. The recombinant enzyme had properties similar to that of the native enzyme in respect to specific activity, kinetic properties, bidirectional decarboxylase-carboxylase activity, oxygen insensitivity, and substrate specificity.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of multi drug resistant Myroides odoratimimus bacteria isolated from adult flesh flies (Diptera: sarcophagidae) are independent of metallo beta-lactamase gene.
AB  - FLESH FLIES (DIPTERA: Sarcophagidae) are well known cause of myiasis and their gut bacteria have never been studied for antimicrobial activity against bacteria. Antimicrobial studies of Myroides spp. are restricted to nosocomial strains. A Gram-negative bacterium, Myroides sp., was isolated from the gut of adult flesh flies (Sarcophaga sp.) and submitted to evaluation of nutritional parameters using Biolog GN, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, susceptibility to various antimicrobials by disc diffusion method and detection of metallo beta-lactamase genes (TUS/MUS). The antagonistic effects were tested on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from human clinical specimens, environmental samples and insect mid gut. Bacterial species included were Aeromonas hydrophila, A. culicicola, Morganella morganii subsp. sibonii, Ochrobactrum anthropi, Weissella confusa, Escherichia coli, Ochrobactrum sp., Serratia sp., Kestersia sp., Ignatzschineria sp., Bacillus sp. The Myroides sp. strain was resistant to penicillin-G, erythromycin, streptomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, gentamycin, ampicillin, trimethoprim and tobramycin. These strain showed antibacterial action against all bacterial strains except W. confusa, Ignatzschineria sp., A. hydrophila and M. morganii subsp. sibonii. The multidrug resistance of the strain was similar to the resistance of clinical isolates, inhibiting growth of bacteria from clinical, environmental and insect gut samples. The metallo beta-lactamase (TUS/MUS) genes were absent, and resistance due to these genes was ruled out, indicating involvement of other secretion machinery.
TI  - [Comparative study of the resistance of bacteriophageT4, PhiX174D, MS2 and f2 to  gamma radiation].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen the suitable bacteriophage as virus indicator in irradiation sterilization. METHODS: Suspensions of bacteriophage T4, phiX174D, MS2, and f2, Escherichia coli 8099, and Bacillus subtilis var.niger.sp. ATCC9372 were irradiated with (60)Co-gamma ray. The mean log(10) inactivation value (LIV) and killing log value (KL) were calculated. RESULTS: (1) Under 100 Gy of gamma-radiation, the LIV levels of the bacteriophage T4, PhiX174, f2, and MS2 were 6.31, 6.92, 5.74, and 4.46 log(10) respectively, all reaching the disinfection level (LIV >/= 4.00 log(10)), (2) Under the same absorbed dose, the KL of Escherichia coli 8099 was > 7.97 log(10); (3) Under the same absorbed dose, the KL of the Bacillus subtilis var.niger.sp. ATCC9372 was 1.61 log(10). CONCLUSION: The order of resistance of the above six microorganisms to gamma-radiation from the biggest to the smallest is as follows: Bacillus subtilis var. niger. sp. > bacteriophage MS2 > bacteriophage f2 > bacteriophage T4 > bacteriophage phiX 174D > E. coli.
TI  - Biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates co-polymer in E. coli using genes from Pseudomonas and Bacillus.
AB  - Expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa genes PHA synthase1 (phaC1) and (R)-specific enoyl CoA hydratase1 (phaJ1) under a lacZ promoter was able to support production of a copolymer of Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and medium chain length polyhydoxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA) in Escherichia coli. In order to improve the yield and quality of PHA, plasmid bearing the above genes was introduced into E. coli JC7623, harboring integrated beta-ketothiolase (phaA) and NADPH dependent-acetoacetyl CoA reductase (phaB) genes from a Bacillus sp. also driven by a lacZ promoter. The recombinant E. coli (JC7623ABC1J1) grown on various fatty acids along with glucose was found to produce 28-34% cellular dry weight of PHA. Gas chromatography and (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis of the polymer confirmed the ability of the strain to produce PHB-co-Hydroxy valerate (HV)-co-mcl-PHA copolymers. The ratio of short chain length (scl) to mcl-PHA varied from 78:22 to 18:82. Addition of acrylic acid, an inhibitor of beta-oxidation resulted in improved production (3-11% increase) of PHA copolymer. The combined use of enzymes from Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. for the production of scl-co-mcl PHA in E. coli is a novel approach and is being reported for the first time.
TI  - Effects of Rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of pulverized petal of Rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. Growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. However, the growth of Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. In liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus salivarius. But the growth of E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. Hydrolyzable tannins isolated from R. rugosa, rugosin D, and tellimagradin II showed antibacterial activities against E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp., but little or no effect against Bif. breve and L. salivarius. R. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. Hydrolyzable tannins in R. rugosa, such as rugosin D and tellimagradin II, must be active constituents.
TI  - Biosorption of nickel, chromium and zinc by MerP-expressing recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli hosts able to over-express metal-binding proteins (MerP) originating from Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus RC607) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas sp. K-62) bacterial strains were used to adsorb Ni(2+), Zn(2+) and Cr(3+) in aqueous solutions. The initial adsorption rate and adsorption capacity were determined to evaluate the performance of the biosorbents. With the expression of MerP protein, the metal adsorption capacity of the recombinant strains for Ni(2+), Zn(2+) and Cr(3+) significantly improved. The cells carrying Gram-positive merP gene (GB) adsorbed Zn(2+) and Cr(3+) at a capacity of 22.3 and 0.98 mmol/g biomass, which is 121% and 72% higher, respectively, over that of the MerP-free host cells. Adsorption capacity of the cells carrying Gram-negative merP gene (GP) also increased 144% and 126% for Zn(2+) and Cr(3+), respectively. Both recombinant strains also exhibited 24% and 5% enhancement in adsorption of Ni(2+) for GB and GP, respectively. The initial adsorption rate of the recombinant biosorbents was also higher than that of the MerP-free host, suggesting an increased metal-binding affinity with MerP expression. Severe cell damage on GB biosorbent was observed after Cr(3+) adsorption, probably due to the metal toxicity effect on the cells.
TI  - [Flocculent genomic clone and flocculating mechanism analysis].
AB  - One strain, named as Bacillus sp. F2, of which flocculent ability can reach 84%,  was separated. Flocculent genomic library was constructed. The total genomic DNA of F2 was extracted. It was partly digested by restriction enzyme Sau3AI and then was connected with carrier PUC19DNA which was totally digested by restriction enzyme BamHI and further was converted to competent cells JM109. These cells were smeared on the ampicillin substrate. After one night culture, we selected them by white-blue spot screening and constructed the flocculent genomic library. The library included 3.5 x 10(4) recons and the titre was 3.5 x 10(5) dpfu/mL. strain of Escherichia coli. positive clone FC2, which could express flocculent activity, was acquired after selection. Flocculent tests showed that the flocculent efficiency of FC2 was 90%, which was slightly higher than the original flocculent bacterium F2 and greatly higher than the competent cell JM109 (6.9%). It demonstrated that FC2's flocculent characteristic inherited from the original flocculent bacterium F2. By adopting the tapping mode AFM and Zeta-potential test, the flocculent microtopography of FC2, F2 and pure kaolin suspending solution was identified. The AFM study revealed that, compared to the kaolin suspending solution with and without F2's fermented liquid, the kaolin suspending solution which has cloning bacterium FC2's fermented liquid had larger flocculent gel and more compact spherical structure, and the surface was rough with high degree concave and convex, and had large specific surface area and strong adsorption ability to the suspending particles in the solution. After adding the fermented solution of cloning bacterium FC2 into kaolin suspending solution, the amorphous and incompact flocculent particles transformed into spherical structure which was compact and had even horizontal dimension, which indicated that the agglutinin in FC2's fermented liquid could easily take kaolin suspending particles as its adsorption core and adsorbed on its surface and the flocculent efficiency was about 90%, which gave further confirmation to the great pollution removal capability of FC2's fermented liquid. The results of Zeta-potential test illustrated that the intensity of electrovalent bond was different, resulting in various flocculent morphology, which provided significant evidences for studying flocculent mechanisms of biofloculant.
TI  - Two new members of streptothricin class antibiotics from Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov.
AB  - Four streptothricin-group antibiotics (1~4) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov. Along with the known antibiotics streptothricins F (1) and D (3), two new members of this class (2, 4) were identified as 12-carbamoyl derivatives of 1 and 3, respectively, mainly by analysis of the IR, HR-MS and NMR spectral data. The antibacterial activities of 1~4 against Escherichia coli (MICs 3.1, 25.0, 3.1 and 12.5 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (MICs 6.3, 25.0, 3.1 and 50 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 12.5, >100.0, 6.3, >100.0 microg/ml), Bacillus cereus (MICs 25.0, 50.0, 25.0 and 50.0 microg/ml) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs 50.0, >100.0, 50.0, >100.0 microg/ml) were assayed by micro-broth dilution. The results based on MIC data indicated that 2 and 4 exhibited significantly less potent antibacterial activities when compared to that of 1 and 3.
TI  - Purification of a lectin from Eugenia uniflora L. seeds and its potential antibacterial activity.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this work was to analyse the antimicrobial properties of a purified lectin from Eugenia uniflora L. seeds. METHODS AND RESULTS: The E. uniflora lectin (EuniSL) was isolated from the seed extract and purified by ion-exchange chromatography in DEAE-Sephadex with a purification factor of 11.68. The purified lectin showed a single band on denaturing electrophoresis, with a molecular mass of 67 kDa. EuniSL agglutinated rabbit and human erythrocytes with a higher specificity for rabbit erythrocytes. The haemagglutination was not inhibited by the tested carbohydrates but glycoproteins exerted a strong inhibitory action. The lectin proved to be thermo resistant with the highest stability at pH 6.5 and divalent ions did not affect its activity. EuniSL demonstrated a remarkable nonselective antibacterial activity. EuniSL strongly inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella sp. with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.5 microg ml(-1), and moderately inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus sp. and Escherichia coli with a MIC of 16.5 microg ml(-1). CONCLUSIONS: EuniSL was found to be effective against bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The strong antibacterial activity of the studied lectin indicates a high potential for clinical microbiology and therapeutic applications.
TI  - Aromatic polyketides from marine algicolous fungi.
AB  - The investigation of the marine-derived fungi Acremonium sp. and Nodulisporium sp. led to the isolation of the new natural products acremonisol A ( 1) and (3 R)-7-hydroxy-5-methylmellein ( 2). Both fungi are endophytes of marine algae. Compounds 1 and 2 are biosynthetically related by both being aromatic pentaketides belonging to the dihydroisocoumarins. All structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic measurements.
TI  - The X-ray structure of N-methyltryptophan oxidase reveals the structural determinants of substrate specificity.
AB  - The X-ray structure of monomeric N-methyltryptophan oxidase from Escherichia coli (MTOX) has been solved at 3.2 A resolution by molecular replacement methods using Bacillus sp. sarcosine oxidase structure (MSOX, 43% sequence identity) as search model. The analysis of the substrate binding site highlights the structural determinants that favour the accommodation of the bulky N-methyltryptophan residue in MTOX. In fact, although the nature and geometry of the catalytic residues within the first contact shell of the FAD moiety appear to be virtually superposable in MTOX and MSOX, the presence of a Thr residue in position 239 in MTOX (Met245 in MSOX) located at the entrance of the active site appears to play a key role for the recognition of the amino acid substrate side chain. Accordingly, a 15 fold increase in k(cat) and 100 fold decrease in K(m) for sarcosine as substrate has been achieved in MTOX upon T239M mutation, with a concomitant three-fold decrease in activity towards N-methyltryptophan. These data provide clear evidence for the presence of a catalytic core, common to the members of the methylaminoacid oxidase subfamily, and of a side chain recognition pocket, located at the entrance of the active site, that can be adjusted to host diverse aminoacids in the different enzyme species. The site involved in the covalent attachment of flavin has also been addressed by screening degenerate mutants in the relevant positions around Cys308-FAD linkage. Lys341 appears to be the key residue involved in flavin incorporation and covalent linkage.
TI  - Expression and purification of BmrI restriction endonuclease and its N-terminal cleavage domain variants.
AB  - BmrI (ACTGGG N5/N4) is one of the few metal-independent restriction endonucleases (REases) found in bacteria. The BmrI restriction-modification system was cloned by the methylase selection method, inverse PCR, and PCR. BmrI REase shows significant amino acid sequence identity to BfiI and a putative endonuclease MspBNCORF3798 from the sequenced Mesorhizobium sp. BNC1 genome. The EDTA-resistant BmrI REase was successfully over-expressed in a pre-modified E. coli strain from pET21a or pBAC-expIQ vectors. The recombinant BmrI REase shows strong promiscuous activity (star activity) in NEB buffers 1, 4, and an EDTA buffer. Star activity was diminished in buffers with 100-150 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl(2). His-tagged BmrI192, the N-terminal cleavage domain of BmrI, was expressed in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies. The refolded BmrI192 protein possesses non-specific endonuclease activity. BmrI192 variants with a single Ser to Cys substitution (S76C or S90C) and BmrI200 (T200C) with a single Cys at the C-terminal end were also constructed and purified. BmrI200 digests both single-strand (ss) and double-strand (ds) DNA and the nuclease activity on ss DNA is at least 5-fold higher than that on ds DNA. The Cys-containing BmrI192 and BmrI200 nuclease variants may be useful for coupling to other DNA binding elements such as synthetic zinc fingers, thio-containing locked nucleic acids (LNA) or peptide nucleic acids (PNA).
TI  - An AbrB-like protein might be involved in the regulation of cylindrospermopsin production by Aphanizomenon ovalisporum.
AB  - Certain filamentous cyanobacteria, including Aphanizomenon ovalisporum, are potentially toxic owing to the formation of the hepatotoxin cylindrospermopsin. We previously identified a gene cluster in A. ovalisporum likely to be involved in cylindrospermopsin biosynthesis, including amidinotransferase (aoaA) and polyketide-synthase (aoaC), transcribed on the reverse strands. Analysis of the genomic region between aoaA and aoaC identified two transcription start points for each of these genes, differentially expressed under nitrogen and light stress conditions. The transcript abundances of these genes and the cylindrospermopsin level were both affected by nitrogen availability and light intensity. Gel shift assays and DNA affinity columns isolated a protein that specifically binds to a 150 bp DNA fragment from the region between aoaA and aoaC, and MS/MS analyses identified similarity to AbrB in other cyanobacteria and in Bacillus sp. Comparison of the native AbrB isolated from A. ovalisporum with that obtained after cloning and overexpression of abrB in Escherichia coli identified specific post-translational modifications in the native cyanobacterial protein. These modifications, which are missing in the protein expressed in E. coli, include N-acetylation and methylation of specific residues. We discuss the possible role of these modifications in the regulation of cylindrospermopsin production in Aphanizomenon.
TI  - Microbial-mediated release of bisphenol A from polycarbonate vessels.
AB  - AIM: To identify the source of bisphenol A (BPA) [2,2'-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propane] in cultures of an antibiotic-producing Bacillus sp. strain grown in polycarbonate flasks. METHODS AND RESULTS: Although a culture of an antibiotic-producing Bacillus sp. strain grown in a new, rinsed polycarbonate flask yielded BPA, duplicate cultures grown in thoroughly washed polycarbonate flasks did not. Cells of Escherichia coli strain C were grown in new polycarbonate flasks rinsed three-times with 100 ml distilled H2O. BPA was only recovered from cultures grown in new polycarbonate flasks, but not from the autoclaved medium incubated in parallel. CONCLUSIONS: BPA was present in either Bacillus or E. coli cultures, probably due to its release from inadequately washed polycarbonate flasks. Standard autoclaving did not result in BPA appearance; microbial growth was required. Polycarbonate vessels for microbial cultures should be thoroughly washed to avoid the appearance of BPA in culture medium. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study rigorously demonstrates that the presence of BPA in culture medium was a consequence of microbial growth or metabolism in inadequately washed polycarbonate flasks. As BPA exhibits antimicrobial and oestrogenic activity, searches for novel drugs or production of recombinant chemotherapeutic agents could be derailed by the artefactual appearance of BPA.
TI  - Biological activity of phenylpropionic acid isolated from a terrestrial Streptomycetes.
AB  - The strain ANU 6277 was isolated from laterite soil and identified as Streptomyces sp. closely related to Streptomyces albidoflavus cluster by 16S rRNA analysis. The cultural, morphological and physiological characters of the strain were recorded. The strain exhibited resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and streptomycin. It had the ability to produce enzymes such as amylase and chitinase. A bioactive compound was isolated from the strain at stationary phase of culture and identified as 3-phenylpropionic acid (3-PPA) by FT-IR, EI-MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral studies. It exhibited antimicrobial activity against different bacteria like Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. flourescens, Staphylococcus aureus and some fungi including Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium oxysporum, F. udum and Penicillium citrinum. The antifungal activity of 3-PPA of the strain was evaluated in in vivo and in vitro conditions against Fusarium udum causing wilt disease in pigeon pea. The compound 3-PPA is an effective antifungal agent when compared to tricyclozole (fungicide) to control wilt caused by F. udum, but it exhibited less antifungal activity than carbendazim.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and characterization of Bacillus sp. snu-7 inulin fructotransferase.
AB  - A gene encoding inulin fructotransferase (di-D-fructofuranose 1,2': 2,3' dianhydride [DFA III]-producing IFTase, EC 4.2.2.18) from Bacillus sp. snu-7 was cloned. This gene was composed of a single, 1,353-bp open reading frame encoding a protein composed of a 40-amino acid signal peptide and a 410-amino acid mature protein. The deduced amino acid sequence was 98% identical to Arthrobacter globiformis C11-1 IFTase (DFA III-producing). The enzyme was successfully expressed in E. coli as a functionally active, His-tagged protein, and it was purified in a single step using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme showed much higher specific activity (1,276units/mg protein) than other DFA III-producing IFTases. The recombinant and native enzymes were optimally active in very similar pH and temperature conditions. With a 103-min half-life at 60 degrees C, the recombinant enzyme was as stable as the native enzyme. Acidic residues and cysteines potentially involved in the catalytic mechanism are proposed based on an alignment with other IFTases and a DFA IIIase.
TI  - Cloning, characterization, and expression of xylanase A gene from Paenibacillus sp. DG-22 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The xynA gene encoding the xylanase A of Paenibacillus sp. DG-22 was isolated with a DNA probe obtained by PCR amplification, using degenerated primers deduced from the amino acid residues of the known N-terminal region of the purified enzyme and the conserved region in the family 11 xylanases. The positive clones were screened on the LB agar plates supplemented with xylan, by the Congo-red staining method. The xynA gene consists of a 630-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 210 amino acids, and the XynA preprotein contains a 28-residues signal peptide whose cleavage yields a 182-residues mature protein of a calculated molecular weight of 20,000 Da and pI value of 8.77. The cloned DNA fragment also has another ORF of 873 nucleotides that showed 76% identity to the putative transcriptional activator of Bacillus halodurans C-125. Most of the xylanase activity was found in the periplasmic space of E. coli. The xynA gene was subcloned into pQE60 expression vector to fuse with six histidine-tag. The recombinant xylanase A was purified by heating and immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The optimum pH and temperature of the purified enzyme were 6.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. This histidine-tagged xylanase A was less thermostable than the native enzyme.
TI  - Rapid detection and isolation of known and putative alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase genes using degenerate PCR primers.
AB  - alpha-L-Arabinofuranosidases (AFases; EC 3.2.1.55) are exo-type enzymes, which hydrolyze terminal nonreducing arabinose residues from various polysaccharides such as arabinan and arabinoxylan. Genome-wide BLAST search showed that various bacterial strains possess the putative AFase genes with well-conserved motif sequences at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels. In this study, two sets of degenerate PCR primers were designed and tested to detect putative AFase genes, based on their three highly conserved amino acid blocks (PGGNFV, GNEMDG, and DEWNVW). Among 20 Bacillus-associated species, 13 species were revealed to have putative AFase genes in their genome and they share over 67% of amino acid identities with each other. Based on the partial sequence obtained from an isolate, an AFase from Geobacillus sp. was cloned and expressed in E. coli. Enzymatic characterization has verified that the resulting enzyme corresponds to a typical AFase. Accordingly, degenerate PCR primers developed in this work can be used for fast, easy, and specific detection and isolation of putative AFase genes from bacterial cells.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of an original gene encoding a maltogenic amylase from Bacillus sp. US149 strain and characterization of the recombinant activity.
AB  - A gene encoding maltogenic amylase from acidic Bacillus sp. US149 (maUS149) was cloned, sequenced and over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 1749 bp encoding a protein of 582 residues. The alignment of deduced amino acid sequence revealed a relatively low homology with the already reported maltogenic amylases. In fact, its highest identity, of only 60%, was found with the maltogenic amylase of Thermus sp. IM6501. The recombinant enzyme (MAUS149) was found to be intracellular and was purified to homogeneity from the cell crude extract with a yield of 23%. According to PAGE analysis, under reducing and non-reducing conditions, the recombinant enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 135 kDa and is composed of two identical subunits of 67.5 kDa each. The maximum activity was obtained at 40 degrees C and pH 6.5. MAUS149 could be classified as a maltogenic amylase since it produces mainly maltose from starch, maltose and glucose from beta-cyclodextrin, and panose from pullulan.
TI  - Characterization of an l-arabinose isomerase from the Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 strain showing pronounced stability at acidic pH.
AB  - Gene araA encoding the l-arabinose isomerase (l-AI) from Lactobacillus plantarum  NC8 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. It encodes a polypeptide of 474 residues having 55% identities with l-AIs from Bacillus stearothermophilus US100 and Thermus sp. IM6501. The active form of the purified recombinant l-AI NC8 enzyme is a hexamer composed of six identical 55-kDa subunits. The purified enzyme was optimally active at 60 degrees C and pH 7.5. It required divalent cations such as Co(2+) and Mn(2+) for maximal activity and thermostability. The l-AI NC8 was exceptionally active and stable at acidic pH. Indeed, it exhibited 68% of its maximal activity at pH 5.5 and retained 89% of activity after a 24-h incubation at pH 5. The apparent K(m) values of the enzyme for l-arabinose and d-galactose were 43.4 and 69.7 mM, respectively, and its catalytic efficiency was c. 10-fold higher for the physiological substrate l-arabinose (15.5 mM(-1) min(-1)) than d-galactose (1.6 mM(-1) min(-1)). The bioconversion yield of d-galactose to d-tagatose by the purified l-AI NC8 after 6 h at 60 degrees C was 30%.
TI  - Exploring the use of natural antimicrobial agents and pulsed electric fields to control spoilage bacteria during a beer production process.
AB  - Different natural antimicrobials affected viability of bacterial contaminants isolated at critical steps during a beer production process. In the presence of 1 mg/ml chitosan and 0.3 mg/ml hops, the viability of Escherichia coli in an all malt barley extract wort could be reduced to 0.7 and 0.1% respectively after 2 hour- incubation at 4 degrees C. The addition of 0.0002 mg/ml nisin, 0.1 mg/ml chitosan or 0.3 mg/ml hops, selectively inhibited growth of Pediococcus sp. in more than 10,000 times with respect to brewing yeast in a mixed culture. In the presence of 0.1 mg ml chitosan in beer, no viable cells of the thermoresistant strain Bacillus megaterium were detected. Nisin, chitosan and hops increased microbiological stability during storage of a local commercial beer inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum or Pediococcus sp. isolated from wort. Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) (8 kV/cm, 3 pulses) application enhanced antibacterial activity of nisin and hops but not that of chitosan. The results herein obtained suggest that the use of these antimicrobial compounds in isolation or in combination with PEF would be effective to control bacterial contamination during beer production and storage.
TI  - Benhamycin, novel alkaloid from terrestrial Streptomyces sp.
AB  - During our screening for bioactive natural compounds from microorganisms, a novel alkaloid has been isolated from a terrestrial Streptomyces sp. isolate NR12, and named as benhamycin (1). This was along with the known metabolites, uracil, thymine, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2'-deoxyuridin, tryptophol, indolyl-3-carboxylic acid, and indolyl-3-carbaldehyde. Chemical structure of the novel compound was determined by detailed analysis of its spectroscopic data (extensive NMR experiments, 1 & 2D, MS spectroscopy, and MS high resolution). Structurally, Benhamycin (1) is a pentacyclic aromatic compound bearing an acridine moiety lactamized with benzene. Biological studies showed that the strain extract was moderately active against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Expression of the Na+/H+ antiporter gene (g1-nhaC) of alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. G1 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene was isolated from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. G1. The  full-length sequence of the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene was obtained using a genome walking method, and designated as g1-nhaC. An ORF preceded by a promoter-like sequence and a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and followed by a terminator-like sequence was identified. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 535 amino acids, and a calculated molecular mass of 57 776 Da. g1-nhaC was subsequently cloned into pET22b(+) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Recombinant E. coli harboring the g1-nhaC gene was able to grow in modified L medium at various concentrations of NaCl (0.2-2.0 M) at different pH values. The recombinant bacteria grew well in the medium with concentrations of NaCl as high as 1.75 M at pH 8.0-9.0. Minimal growth was observed at 2.0 M NaCl, pH 8.0-9.0. At pH 10, the recombinant bacteria grew well in a medium with a low concentration of NaCl (0.2 M). These results suggested that the g1-NhaC antiporter from Bacillus sp. G1 plays a role in Na(+) extrusion at lower pH values and in pH homeostasis at pH 10 under Na(+)-limiting conditions.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(II) chelate.
AB  - Some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. Yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. Copper(II) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-N-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. Both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. I report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(II) chelate. They were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus lactis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (Aspergillus niger). Two clinical isolates of Bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. Both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. The ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except for S. lactis, and its activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. It was highly active against A. niger and moderately active against C. albicans. The chelate was highly active against S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae. Both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. Since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a bacteriocin-like substance produced by Bacillus sp. P34 that targets the bacterial cell envelope.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the mode of action of BLS P34, a bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) produced by a novel Bacillus sp. strain P34 isolated from the Amazon basin. The effect of the BLS was tested against Listeria monocytogenes, showing a bactericidal effect at 200 AU (activity units) ml(-1), while no inhibition of spore outgrowth of Bacillus cereus was observed with a dose of 1,600 AU ml(-1). Growth of Escherichia coli and Salmonella Enteritidis was inhibited, but only when the chelating agent EDTA was co-added with the BLS. The effect of BLS P34 on L. monocytogenes was also investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Treated cells showed an important frequency increase in 1,452 and 1,397 cm(-1) and decrease in 1,217 and 1,058 cm(-1), corresponding assignments of fatty acids and phospholipids. Transmission electron microscopy showed damaged cell envelope and loss of protoplasmic material. BLS P34 was bactericidal to Gram-positive, and also showed inhibitory effect against Gram-negative bacteria. There is evidence that its mode of action corresponds to that of a membrane-active substance. The knowledge about the mode of action of this BLS is essential to determine its effective application as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Macrolactins O-R, glycosylated 24-membered lactones from Bacillus sp. AH159-1.
AB  - In the course of screening for inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus peptide deformylase, four new glycosylated macrolactin compounds, macrolactins O ( 1), P ( 2), Q ( 3), and R ( 4), along with the known macrolactins B ( 5) and C ( 6), have been isolated from the liquid cultures of Bacillus sp. AH159-1. The structures of compounds 1- 4 were assigned on the basis of MS and NMR data. They inhibited S. aureus peptide deformylase and also showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Studies on purification and properties of antagonistic protein from bacteria SS02 of Paenibacillus daejeonensis].
AB  - The antifungal, anti-bacterical, anti-brine shrimp activities of SD22 isolated from Paenibacillus daejeonensis Bacteria SS02 were studied. The separation steps included ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration and (NH4)2SO4 fractional precipitation, further purification was performed by SephadexG-75 and DEAE-32 chromatography. Its molecular weight determined by SDS-PAGE was 56.0 kD and its isoelectfic point was 6.4. SD22 was thermostable to some extent and stable to ultraviolet, but sensitive to some of the enzyme. SD22 could kill most pathogens from propagation, such as Rhizoctonia cerealis, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Physalospora piricala, Trichodema viride, Gliocladium viride, Curvularia leaf spot, Fusarium sp, Fusarium head blight, Beauveria Bassiana, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis , Candidal vaginitis, Fusarium oxysporum Schl. emend. Sayder & Hansem et al. The results will be helpful to find out a novel antifungal protein.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - The structural basis for unidirectional rotation of thermoalkaliphilic F1-ATPase.
AB  - The ATP synthase of the thermoalkaliphilic Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 operates exclusively in ATP synthesis direction. In the crystal structure of the nucleotide-free alpha(3)beta(3)gamma epsilon subcomplex (TA2F(1)) at 3.1 A resolution, all three beta subunits adopt the open beta(E) conformation. The structure shows salt bridges between the helix-turn-helix motif of the C-terminal domain of the beta(E) subunit (residues Asp372 and Asp375) and the N-terminal helix of the gamma subunit (residues Arg9 and Arg10). These electrostatic forces pull the gamma shaft out of the rotational center and impede rotation through steric interference with the beta(E) subunit. Replacement of Arg9 and Arg10 with glutamines eliminates the salt bridges and results in an activation of ATP hydrolysis activity, suggesting that these salt bridges prevent the native enzyme from rotating in ATP hydrolysis direction. A similar bending of the gamma shaft as in the TA2F(1) structure was observed by single-particle analysis of the TA2F(1)F(o) holoenzyme.
TI  - Streptomyces vietnamensis sp. nov., a streptomycete with violet blue diffusible pigment isolated from soil in Vietnam.
AB  - An actinomycete, designated strain GIMV4.0001(T), was isolated from a forest soil sample in Vietnam. It produced white aerial mycelium and violet-blue diffusible pigment on Gause's synthetic agar. The substrate mycelium colour was not sensitive to pH. Micoscopic observations revealed that strain GIMV4.0001(T) produced long, straight chains of cylindrical spores, and chemotaxonomic data confirmed that it belongs to the genus Streptomyces. Melanin was produced, but no antibacterial activity was evident against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans or Penicillium citrinum. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain GIMV4.0001(T) revealed that the highest similarity (99.4 %) was to Streptomyces bikiniensis ATCC 11062(T). However, the DNA-DNA relatedness between strain GIMV4.0001(T) and S. bikiniensis ATCC 11062(T) was found to be 50.3 %. Strain GIMV4.0001(T) could also be differentiated from S. bikiniensis ATCC 11062(T) and other Streptomyces species showing high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (98-99 %) based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. On the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, it is evident that strain GIMV4.0001(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces vietnamensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GIMV4.0001(T) (=CCTCC M 205143(T)=IAM 15340(T)).
TI  - Walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves: phenolic compounds, antibacterial activity and  antioxidant potential of different cultivars.
AB  - Different cultivars of walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves (Cv. Lara, Franquette, Mayette, Marbot, Mellanaise and Parisienne) grown in Portugal, were investigated in what concerns phenolic compounds and antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Phenolics analysis was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD and 10 compounds were identified and quantified: 3- and 5-caffeoylquinic acids, 3- and 4-p-coumaroylquinic acids, p-coumaric acid, quercetin 3-galactoside, quercetin 3-pentoside derivative, quercetin 3-arabinoside, quercetin 3-xyloside and quercetin 3-rhamnoside. The antimicrobial capacity was screened against Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). Walnut leaves selectively inhibited the growth of Gram positive bacteria, being B. cereus the most susceptible one (MIC 0.1mg/mL). Gram negative bacteria and fungi were resistant to the extracts at 100mg/mL. Lara walnut leaves were also submitted to antibacterial assays using 18 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus sp. Antioxidant activity was accessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. In a general way, all of the studied walnut leaves cultivars presented high antioxidant activity (EC(50) values lower than 1mg/mL), being Cv. Lara the most effective one.
TI  - Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of intact bacteria.
AB  - Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) mass spectrometry (MS) was used to differentiate seven bacteria species on the basis of their measured DESI-mass spectral profile. Both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were tested and included Escherichia coli, Staphyloccocus aureus, Enterococcus sp., Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhimurium. Distinct DESI-mass spectra, in the mass range of 50-500 u, were obtained from whole bacteria in either positive or negative ion modes in less than 2 mins analysis time. Positive ion DESI-mass spectral fingerprints were compared using principal components analysis (PCA) to investigate reproducibility for the intraday and the day-to-day measurements and the method selectivity to differentiate the bacteria studied. Detailed study of variances in the assay revealed that a large contribution to the DESI-mass spectral fingerprint variation was the growth media preparation procedure. Specifically, experiments conducted with the growth media prepared using the same batch yielded highly reproducible DESI-mass spectra, both in intraday and in day-to-day analyses (i.e. one batch of growth media used over a 3-day period versus a new batch every day over the same 3-day period). Conclusions are drawn from our findings in terms of strategies for rapid biodetection with DESI-MS.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in the common seawhip, Leptogorgia virgulata (Cnidaria: Gorgonaceae).
AB  - Antimicrobial activity was examined in the gorgonian Leptogorgia virgulata (common seawhip) from South Carolina waters. Extraction and assay protocols were developed to identify antimicrobial activity in crude extracts of L. virgulata. Detection was determined by liquid growth inhibition assays using Escherichia coli BL21, Vibrio harveyii, Micrococcus luteus, and a Bacillus sp. isolate. This represents the first report of antimicrobial activity in L. virgulata, a temperate/sub-tropical coral of the western Atlantic Ocean. Results from growth inhibition assays guided a fractionation scheme to identify active compounds. Reverse-phase HPLC, HPLC-mass spectrometry, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy were used to isolate, purify, and characterize metabolites in antimicrobial fractions of L. virgulata. Corroborative HPLC-MS/NMR evidence validated the presence of homarine and a homarine analog, well-known emetic metabolites previously isolated from L. virgulata, in coral extracts. In subsequent assays, partially-purified L. virgulata fractions collected from HPLC-MS fractionation were shown to contain antimicrobial activity using M. luteus and V. harveyii. This study provides evidence that homarine is an active constituent of the innate immune system in L. virgulata. We speculate it may act synergistically with cofactors and/or congeners in this octocoral to mount a response to microbial invasion and disease.
TI  - Alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain KSM-LD1 contains a record number of subtilisin-like serine proteases genes.
AB  - The presence of 11 genes encoding subtilisin-like serine proteases was demonstrated by cloning from the genome of alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain KSM-LD1. This strain exoproduces the oxidatively stable alkaline protease LD-1 (Saeki et al. Curr Microbiol, 47:337-340, 2003). Among the 11 genes, six genes encoding alkaline proteases (SA, SB, SC, SD, SE, and LD-1) were expressed in Bacillus hosts. However, the other five genes for subtilisin-like proteases (SF, SG, SH, SI, and SJ) were expressed in neither Bacillus hosts nor Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of SA, SB, SC, SF, SG, SH, SI, and SJ showed similarity to those of other subtilisin-like proteases from Bacillus strains with only 38 to 86% identity. The deduced amino acid sequence of SD was completely identical to that of an oxidatively stable alkaline protease from Bacillus sp. strain SD521, and that of SE was almost identical to that of a high-molecular mass subtilisin from Bacillus sp. strain D-6 with 99.7% identity. There are four to nine subtilisin-like serine protease genes in the reported genomes of Bacillus strains. At least 11 genes for the enzymes present in the genome of Bacillus sp. strain KSM-LD1, and this is the greatest number identified to date.
TI  - An azoreductase, aerobic NADH-dependent flavoprotein discovered from Bacillus sp.: functional expression and enzymatic characterization.
AB  - The gene coding for an azoreductase, designated as an azrA, was cloned by polymerase chain reaction amplification from the genomic DNA of Bacillus sp. strain B29 isolated from soil. The azrA encoded a protein of 208 amino acids with calculated molecular mass of 22,766 Da. The enzyme was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli with a strong band of 23 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified recombinant AzrA was a homodimer with a native molecular mass of 48 kDa containing two molecules of flavin mononucleotide (FMN; oxidized). This activity was oxygen insensitive and was nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form; NADH) dependent. Recombinant AzrA exhibited a broad pH stability between 6 and 10 with a temperature optimum of 60-80 degrees C. The enzyme cleaved the model azo compound of methyl red [MR, 4'-(dimethylamino)-azobenzene-2-carboxylic acid] into 2-aminobenzoic acid and N, N'-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine by ping-pong mechanism. The enzyme was not only able to decolorize MR but also able to decolorize sulfonated azo dyes such as Orange I and Acid Red 88.
TI  - A new monocupin quercetinase of Streptomyces sp. FLA: identification and heterologous expression of the queD gene and activity of the recombinant enzyme towards different flavonols.
AB  - The gene queD encoding quercetinase of Streptomyces sp. FLA, a soil isolate related to S. eurythermus (T), was identified. Quercetinases catalyze the 2,4-dioxygenolytic cleavage of 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavone to 2-protocatechuoylphloroglucinol carboxylic acid and carbon monoxide. The queD gene was expressed in S. lividans and E. coli, and the recombinant hexahistidine-tagged protein (QueDHis(6)) was purified. Several flavonols were converted by QueDHis(6), whereas CO formation from the 2,3-dihydroflavonol taxifolin and the flavone luteolin were not observed. In contrast to bicupin quercetinases from Aspergillus japonicus and Bacillus subtilis, and bicupin pirins showing quercetinase activity, QueD of strain FLA is a monocupin exhibiting 35.9% sequence identity to the C-terminal domain of B. subtilis quercetinase. Its native molecular mass of 63 kDa suggests a multimeric protein. A queD-specific probe hybridized with fragments of genomic DNA of four other quercetin degrading Streptomyces strains, but not with DNA of B. subtilis. Potential ORFs upstream of queD probably code for a serine protease and an endoribonuclease; two ORFs downstream of queD may encode an amidohydrolase and a carboxylesterase. This arrangement suggests that queD is not part of a catabolic gene cluster. Quercetinases might play a major role as detoxifying rather than catabolic enzymes.
TI  - Biomedical evaluation of black lemurs (Eulemur macaco macaco) in Lokobe Reserve,  Madagascar.
AB  - Complete medical evaluations were performed on 25 wild black lemurs (Eulemur macaco macaco) in Lokobe Reserve, northwestern Madagascar. Each animal received a complete physical examination. Weight, body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded. Blood samples were collected for complete blood cell count, differential white blood cell count, hemoparasite examination, serum biochemical profile, fat-soluble vitamin analysis, trace mineral analysis, and Toxoplasma gondii and viral serology. Fecal samples were collected for bacterial culture and endoparasite examination. Ectoparasites were collected and identified. Values were compared to established ranges from captive black lemurs in North American zoos. Significant differences exist between captive and wild animals for total white blood cell count, segmented neutrophil count, band neutrophil count, eosinophil count, monocyte count, and basophil count, and for serum biochemistry values of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, serum alkaline phosphatase, total protein, creatinine, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, potassium, and creatine phosphokinase. One animal had a positive Toxoplasma titer. Detected endoparasites were identified as Lemuricola and Callistroura. Two ectoparasite mites were identified, one within the Psoroptes genus and one within the Laelapidae family. Enteric bacterial flora included Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Klebsiella ozaenae and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterization of Ba-EGA, a cellulase secreted by Bacillus sp. AC-1 from Ampullaria crosseans.
AB  - A novel gene (Ba-ega) of Bacillus sp. AC-1, encoding an endoglucanase (Ba-EGA), was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Ba-ega, containing a 1,980-bp open reading frame (ORF), encoded a protein of 659 amino acids and had a molecular mass of 74.87 kDa. Ba-EGA was a modular enzyme composed of a family-9 glycosyl hydrolase catalytic module (CM9) and a family-3 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM3). To investigate the functions of the CBM3 and CM9, a number of truncated derivatives of Ba-EGA were constructed, and all were active. The catalytic module (rCM9) alone was less stable at high temperature than the recombinant Ba-EGA (rBa-EGA). The temperature stability for the complex of rCM9 and rCBM3 was still lower than rBa-EGA, but higher than rCM9 alone. These observations indicated the existence of a non-covalent interaction between CM9 and CBM3 that might strengthen the stability of CM9. However, this interaction is not strong enough to mimic the protective effect of the CBM in the wild-type enzyme.
TI  - A specific adaptation in the a subunit of thermoalkaliphilic F1FO-ATP synthase enables ATP synthesis at high pH but not at neutral pH values.
AB  - Analysis of the atp operon from the thermoalkaliphilic Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 and comparison with other atp operons from alkaliphilic bacteria reveals the presence of a conserved lysine residue at position 180 (Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 numbering) within the a subunit of these F(1)F(o)-ATP synthases. We hypothesize that the basic nature of this residue is ideally suited to capture protons from the bulk phase at high pH. To test this hypothesis, a heterologous expression system for the ATP synthase from Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 (TA2F(1)F(o)) was developed in Escherichia coli DK8 (Deltaatp). Amino acid substitutions were made in the a subunit of TA2F(1)F(o) at position 180. Lysine (aK180) was substituted for the basic residues histidine (aK180H) or arginine (aK180R), and the uncharged residue glycine (aK180G). ATP synthesis experiments were performed in ADP plus P(i)-loaded right-side-out membrane vesicles energized by ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate. When these enzyme complexes were examined for their ability to perform ATP synthesis over the pH range from 7.0 to 10.0, TA2F(1)F(o) and aK180R showed a similar pH profile having optimum ATP synthesis rates at pH 9.0-9.5 with no measurable ATP synthesis at pH 7.5. Conversely, aK180H and aK180G showed maximal ATP synthesis at pH values 8.0 and 7.5, respectively. ATP synthesis under these conditions for all enzyme forms was sensitive to DCCD. These data strongly imply that amino acid residue Lys(180) is a specific adaptation within the a subunit of TA2F(1)F(o) to facilitate proton capture at high pH. At pH values near the pK(a) of Lys(180), the trapped protons readily dissociate to reach the subunit c binding sites, but this dissociation is impeded at neutral pH values causing either a blocking of the proposed H(+) channel and/or mechanism of proton translocation, and hence ATP synthesis is inhibited.
TI  - A marine Mesorhizobium sp. produces structurally novel long-chain N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones.
AB  - Our study focused on a Mesorhizobium sp. that is phylogenetically affiliated by 16S rRNA gene sequence to other marine and saline bacteria of this genus. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry investigations of the extract obtained from solid-phase extraction of cultures of this bacterium indicated the presence of several N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), with chain lengths of C(10) to C(16). Chromatographic separation of the active bacterial extract yielded extraordinarily large amounts of two unprecedented acylated homoserine lactones, 5-cis-3-oxo-C(12)-homoserine lactone (5-cis-3-oxo-C(12)-HSL) (compound 1) and 5-cis-C(12)-HSL (compound 2). Quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 was shown in two different biosensor systems [Escherichia coli MT102(pSB403) and Pseudomonas putida F117(pKR-C12)]. Furthermore, it was shown that both compounds can restore protease and pyoverdin production of an AHL-deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 lasI rhlI double mutant, suggesting that these signal molecules maybe used for intergenus signaling. In conclusion, these data indicate that the quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 is modulated by the chain length and functional groups of the acyl moiety. Additionally, compound 1 showed antibacterial and cytotoxic activities.
TI  - Cloning, expression, purification and characterization of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase from Anoxybacillus gonensis G2.
AB  - The fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase gene from the thermophilic bacterium, Anoxybacillus gonensis G2, was cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame coding for a 30.9 kDa protein of 286 amino acids. The amino acid sequence shared approximately 80-90% similarity to the Bacillus sp. class II aldolases. The motifs that are responsible for the binding of a divalent metal ion and catalytic activity completely conserved. The gene encoding aldolase was overexpressed under T7 promoter control in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Kinetic characterization of the enzyme was performed at 60 degrees C, and K(m) and V(max) were found to be 576 microM and 2.4 microM min(-1) mg protein(-1), respectively. Enzyme exhibits maximal activity at pH 8.5. The activity of enzyme was completely inhibited by EDTA.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the gene encoding cold-active beta-galactosidase from a psychrotrophic and halotolerant Planococcus sp. L4.
AB  - The gene bgaP encoding cold-active beta-galactosidase from a psychrotrophic and halotolerant Planococcus sp. L4 was cloned into Escherichia coli and sequenced. A sequence analysis of the DNA responsible for the BgaP gene revealed an open reading frame of 2031 bp encoding for a protein of 677 amino acid residues. The BgaP was heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified followed by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was approximately 156 kDa as determined by gel filtration. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the deduced amino acid sequence of the BgaP indicated molecular masses of 78 and 77.311 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the BgaP is a dimer. The purified BgaP had an isoelectric point of 4.8 and exhibited maximal activity at 20 degrees C and pH 6.8 under the assay conditions used. The enzyme is particularly thermolabile, losing all activity in only 10 min at 45 degrees C. It was able to hydrolyze lactose as a substrate, as well as o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG); the Km values with ONPG and lactose were calculated to be 5.4 and 20.4 mM at 5 degrees C, respectively. The catalytic efficiencies of BagP for lactose at 5 and 20 degrees C had 14 and 47 times more than that of E. coli beta-galactosidase at 20 degrees C, respectively. Therefore, cold-active beta-galactosidase from the psychrotrophic and halotolerant Planococcus sp. L4 could conceivably be developed to fulfill the practical requirements to enable its use for lactose removal in milk and dairy products at low temperature or a reporter enzyme for psychrophilic genetic systems.
TI  - Biological Screening of a Novel Nickel (II) Tyrosine Complex.
AB  - A newly synthesized Nickel (II) tyrosine complex was screened as potential antimicrobial agent against a number of medically important bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus beta-haemolytica, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenterae) and fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium sp.) strains. were used for antifungal activity. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the Agar Disc method. Moreover, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the complexes was determined against the same pathogenic bacteria and the values were found between 4~64 microg ml (-1). Brine shrimp bioassay was carried out for cytotoxicity measurements of the complexes. The LC50 values were calculated after probit transformation of the resulting mortality data and found to be 6 microg ml (-1).
TI  - Kolokosides A-D: triterpenoid glycosides from a Hawaiian isolate of Xylaria sp.
AB  - Four new triterpenoid glycosides, kolokosides A-D (1-4), along with the known compound 19,20-epoxycytochalasin N, were isolated from cultures of a Hawaiian wood-decay fungus (Xylaria sp.). The structures and relative configurations of 1-4 were determined primarily by analysis of NMR data, and the absolute configuration of 1 was assigned by application of the exciton chirality method. Compound 1 exhibited activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the broad bean extracts on resistant bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of four different extracts (ethanol, methanol, distilled water and 2-Methylbutan-1-01) obtained from different parts of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) such as flowers, leaves, seeds and seed hulls and were tested against Bacillus subtilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella peneumoniua, Shigella sp. and Micrococcus pyogenes. Better antimicrobial activity was observed with the leaves of broad bean sterile distilled water extract with a zone of inhibition in between 13-32 mm. Flower and seed hull showed by Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Bacillus subtilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus pyogenes a zone of inhibition in between 15-29 and 14-19 mm, respectively. Leaves, seed hulls and flowers of broad bean with ethanol extract showed by Escherichia coli a zone of inhibition in between 25-34, 15-17 and 15 mm, respectively. Flower with ethanol extract had a zone of inhibition in between 15-16 mm by Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus pyogenes, respectively. Different parts of Broad Bean with methanol and 2-Methylbutan-l-01 extract did not shown any antimicrobial affects.
TI  - A microbiological study of bottled mineral water marketed in Ludhiana.
AB  - The microbiological quality of bottled mineral water marketed in Ludhiana was examined, Twenty three brands were analyzed for presumptive coliform count by multiple tube tests, and E. coli count was confirmed by Eijkman test. Bacterial and fungal loads were tested by membrane filtration test. Out of 23 only one sample (4.4%) showed the presumptive coliform count to be 460 most probable number (MPN)l 1 00ml,and 1 was found to be positive when tested by Eijkman test for Ecoli. In the membrane filtration test three samples (13%) showed more than two types of bacteria. Different types of bacteria isolated included Bacillus sp (19/23). Pseudomonas spp (13123), Ecoli, Klebsiella sp and S.albus one each Fungi was isolated from five of twenty three. (22%) samples. Only one brand of mineral water was unfit for human consumption. The rest of the samples were contaminated with non pathogenic flora.
TI  - Biological Cr(VI) reduction in indigenous sludge cultures from Gauteng, South africa.
AB  - The Cr(VI) reducing capability of an acclimated indigenous culture cultivated from primary sludge was evaluated in batch and packed-bed bioreactor systems. Performance evaluation was carried out in unmodified cultures, cultures modified by substituting terminal organisms in the consortium by a known Cr(VI)-reducing organism (Escherichia coli ATCC 33456), and pure cultures of Cr(VI)-reducing organisms. A high Cr(VI) reduction rate was observed in modified cultures and in the pure culture of the Cr(VI)-reducing bacteria (Bacillus sp.). Furthermore, the Bacillus sp. pure culture outperformed both the unmodified and modified consortium cultures in reducing Cr(VI). Abiotic Cr(VI) reduction activity was evaluated in heat-killed and azide (N3) inactivated control cultures. No significant Cr(VI) reduction was observed in the controls. This study is part of the continuing research to identify synergistic culture systems for treating toxic compounds from polluted environments.
TI  - Involvement of cytoplasmic membrane damage in the copper (II)-dependent cytotoxicity of a novel naturally occurring tripyrrole.
AB  - In the presence of a nonlethal concentration of Cu(II), washed Escherichia coli ATCC8739 cells were killed by a novel tripyrrole 1, isolated as a red pigment from the Serratia sp. Cell killing was accompanied by a depletion in the potassium pools of the cells due to the damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, without any detectable DNA damage as revealed by the transformed plasmid DNA and phage induction assay. This revealed that the bactericidal activity of compound 1 in the presence of Cu(II) results from membrane damage. Induction of endogenous catalase in the E. coli cells increased their resistance against the combination of compound 1 and Cu(II). Although compound 1 alone generated large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), it did not show any cell killing against E. coli in the absence of Cu(II). The Cu(II)-dependent bactericidal activity of compound 1 was suppressed by ethylenediaminetetraacetate, bathocuproine, catalase and superoxide disumutase (SOD), but not by dimethyl sulfoxide. These findings suggest that recycling redox reactions between Cu(II) and Cu(I), involving compound 1 and hydrogen peroxide on the cell surface, must be important in the mechanism of the killing. Compound 1 alone showed selective bactericidal activity against the gram positive bacterium, Bacillus cereus ATCC 6630, possibly due to its differential cellular transport.
TI  - Cloning, purification, and characterization of chitinase from Bacillus sp. DAU101.
AB  - A chitinase encoding gene from Bacillus sp. DAU101 was cloned in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequencing revealed a single open reading frame containing 1781 bp and encoding 597 amino acids with 66 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zymogram. The chitinase was composed of three domains: a catalytic domain, a fibronectin III domain, and a chitin binding domain. The chitinase was purified by GST-fusion purification system. The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme were 7.5 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The metal ions, Zn(2+), Cu(2+), and Hg(2+), were strongly inhibited chitinase activity. However, chitinase activity was increased 1.4-fold by Co(2+). Chisb could hydrolyze GlcNAc(2) to N-acetylglucosamine and was produced GlcNAc(2), when chitin derivatives were used as the substrate. This indicated that Chisb was a bifunctional enzyme, N-acetylglucosaminase and chitobiosidase. The enzyme could not hydrolyze glycol chitin, glycol chitosan, or CMC, but hydrolyzed colloidal chitin and soluble chitosan.
TI  - A novel highly boron tolerant bacterium, Bacillus boroniphilus sp. nov., isolated from soil, that requires boron for its growth.
AB  - Three strains of gram-positive, motile, rod-shaped and boron (B)-tolerant bacterium were isolated from naturally B containing soil of Hisarcik area in the Kutahya Province, Turkey. The strains, designated as T-14A, T-15Z(T) and T-17s, produced spherical or ellipsoidal endospores in a terminal bulging sporangium. The strains required B for the growth and can tolerate more than 450 mM B. These also tolerated up to 7.0% (w/v) NaCl in the presence of 50 mM B in agar medium but grew optimally without NaCl. The temperature range for growth was 16-37 degrees C (optimal of 30 degrees C), whereas the pH range was 6.5-9.0 (optimal of 7.5-8.5). The DNA G + C content was 41.1-42.2 mol% and the predominant cellular fatty acid was iso-C(15:0). The major respiratory quinone system was detected as MK-7 and the diamino acid of the peptidoglycan was meso-diaminopimelic acid. Based on phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences data and DNA-DNA re-association values, we concluded that the three strains belong to a novel species of the genus Bacillus, the type strain of which is T-15Z(T) and for which we proposed the name, B. boroniphilus sp. nov. (DSM 17376(T) = IAM 15287(T) = ATCC BAA-1204(T)).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some ethnomedicinal plants used by Paliyar tribe from Tamil Nadu, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial activity of 18 ethnomedicinal plant extracts were evaluated against nine bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ervinia sp, Proteus vulgaris) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans). The collected ethnomedicinal plants were used in folk medicine in the treatment of skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders. METHODS: Plants were collected from Palni hills of Southern Western Ghats and the ethnobotanical data were gathered from traditional healers who inhabit the study area. The hexane and methanol extracts were obtained by cold percolation method and the antimicrobial activity was found using paper disc diffusion method. All microorganisms were obtained from Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. RESULTS: The results indicated that out of 18 plants, 10 plants exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested microorganisms at three different concentrations of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/disc. Among the plants tested, Acalypha fruticosa, Peltophorum pterocarpum, Toddalia asiatica,Cassia auriculata, Punica granatum and Syzygium lineare were most active. The highest antifungal activity was exhibited by methanol extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum and Punica granatum against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the some ethnomedicinal plants used in folkloric medicine. Compared to hexane extract, methanol extract showed significant activity against tested organisms. This study also showed that Toddalia asiatica, Syzygium lineare, Acalypha fruticosa and Peltophorum pterocarpum could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Conformational and functional studies of gomesin analogues by CD, EPR and fluorescence spectroscopies.
AB  - The aim of this work was to examine the bioactivity and the conformational behavior of some gomesin (Gm) analogues in different environments that mimic the biological membrane/water interface. Thus, manual peptide synthesis was performed by the solid-phase method, antimicrobial activity was evaluated by a liquid growth inhibition assay, and conformational studies were performed making use of several spectroscopic techniques: CD, fluorescence and EPR. [TOAC(1)]-Gm; [TOAC(1), Ser(2,6,11,15)]-Gm; [Trp(7)]-Gm; [Ser(2,6,11,15), Trp(7)]-Gm; [Trp(9)]-Gm; and [Ser(2,6,11,15), Trp(9)]-Gm were synthesized and tested. The results indicated that incorporation of TOAC or Trp caused no significant reduction of antimicrobial activity; the cyclic analogues presented a beta-hairpin conformation similar to that of Gm. All analogues interacted with negatively charged SDS both above and below the detergent's critical micellar concentration (cmc). In contrast, while Gm and [TOAC(1)]-Gm required higher LPC concentrations to bind to micelles of this zwitterionic detergent, the cyclic Trp derivatives and the linear derivatives did not seem to interact with this membrane-mimetic system. These data corroborate previous results that suggest that electrostatic interactions with the lipid bilayer of microorganisms play an important role in the mechanism of action of gomesin. Moreover, the results show that hydrophobic interactions also contribute to membrane binding of this antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Screening for anti-infective properties of several medicinal plants of the Mauritians flora.
AB  - Several plants of the Mauritian flora alleged to possess anti-infective properties were studied against different strains of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. Preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by Escherichia coli (57.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus Candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. Bioautography using Cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (DCM) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. It was also noted that the DCM extracts of Michelia champaca and Antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against Cladosporium cucumerinum. Activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotium, Guignardia sp. and Fusarium oxysporum. It was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude DCM extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Sclerotinia sclerotium and Guignardia sp.
TI  - Midgut bacteria required for Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal activity.
AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis is the most widely applied biological insecticide and is used to manage insects that affect forestry and agriculture and transmit human and animal pathogens. This ubiquitous spore-forming bacterium kills insect larvae largely through the action of insecticidal crystal proteins and is commonly deployed as a direct bacterial spray. Moreover, plants engineered with the cry genes encoding the B. thuringiensis crystal proteins are the most widely cultivated transgenic crops. For decades, the mechanism of insect killing has been assumed to be toxin-mediated lysis of the gut epithelial cells, which leads to starvation, or B. thuringiensis septicemia. Here, we report that B. thuringiensis does not kill larvae of the gypsy moth in the absence of indigenous midgut bacteria. Elimination of the gut microbial community by oral administration of antibiotics abolished B. thuringiensis insecticidal activity, and reestablishment of an Enterobacter sp. that normally resides in the midgut microbial community restored B. thuringiensis-mediated killing. Escherichia coli engineered to produce the B. thuringiensis insecticidal toxin killed gypsy moth larvae irrespective of the presence of other bacteria in the midgut. However, when the engineered E. coli was heat-killed and then fed to the larvae, the larvae did not die in the absence of the indigenous midgut bacteria. E. coli and the Enterobacter sp. achieved high populations in hemolymph, in contrast to B. thuringiensis, which appeared to die in hemolymph. Our results demonstrate that B. thuringiensis-induced mortality depends on enteric bacteria.
TI  - Oxidative destabilization of dissolved organics and E. coli in domestic wastewater through immobilized cell reactor system.
AB  - Domestic wastewater contains a considerable amount of pathogenic organisms besides non-biodegradable organics. The conventional technologies followed for the treatment of domestic wastewater are less efficient in removing pathogenic organisms despite substantial removal of dissolved organics. The focal theme of the present investigation was to use a chemo-autotrophic activated carbon oxidation (CAACO) system, an immobilized cell reactor using chemoautotrophs (Bacillus sp.) for the treatment of domestic wastewater. The oxidation of organics and Escherichia coli in wastewater is controlled by the parameters space time, O(2)/COD, bed height and cod loading. The scheme comprised of anaerobic treatment, sand filtration and CAACO treatment removed BOD. COD, Total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved protein, total Kjeldhal nitrogen (TKN) and bacterial count (most probable number (MPN)) by 81%, 92%, 84%, 94%, 93% and 99.9997%, respectively. The low concentration of E. coli in the CAACO-treated wastewater was completely eliminated through UV irradiation in 3 min at 254 nm.
TI  - Expression and characterization of a thermostable sarcosine oxidase (SOX) from Bacillus sp. in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A heat-stable sarcosine oxidase produced by Bacillus sp. BSD-8 (SOX) had been studied and its complete gene sequence, which contained 1,164 bp nucleotides and encoded a protein of 387 amino acids, was obtained by DNA Walking method. The sox gene was cloned and functionally overexpressed in E. coli and the recombinant SOX (rSOX) was purified to homogeneity, its properties was studied and compared with the wild type of SOX. The rSOX as well as SOX was stable at 60 degrees C and at pH 7.0 approximately 10.0, respectively. The optimal temperature for this enzyme was 60 degrees C and at pH 8.5, it showed its highest activity. The Km and Kcat of the enzyme was 3.1 mM and 20.3/s, respectively. The difference between the properties of the SOX and rSOX was that the SOX contained noncovalent FAD, whereas the rSOX contained covalent FAD. The study also showed that an increased number of alanine residues in the rSOX might have some contribution in the enzymatic thermostability.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some unsymmetrical diorganyltellurium(IV) dichlorides.
AB  - Six unsymmetrical diorganyltellurium(IV) dichlorides RR'TeCl2 (where R= phenacyl-, 1-naphthacyl-, and styrylacyl- and R' = p-methoxyphenyl, p-hydroxyphenyl-, and 3-methyl-4-hydoxyphenyl-) were tested for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Salmonella sp.) bacteria. Antibacterial activity was measured by disk diffusion method. Inhibition zones demonstrated that all the compounds showed good activity against gram-negative strains. Phenacyl (3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride and naphthacyl (3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride showed significant activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative strains. Among the tested compounds, the former exhibited maximum activity against gram-positive bacteria, while the latter against all the bacteria under study and styrylacyl (p-methoxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride against all the three gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Systematic screening of all signal peptides from Bacillus subtilis: a powerful strategy in optimizing heterologous protein secretion in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Efficient protein secretion is very important in biotechnology as it provides active and stable enzymes, which are an essential prerequisite for successful biocatalysis. Therefore, optimizing enzyme-producing bacterial strains is a major challenge in the field of biotechnology and protein production. In this study, the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis was optimized for heterologous protein secretion using a novel approach. Two lipolytic enzymes, cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi and a cytoplasmatic esterase of metagenomic origin, were chosen as reporters for heterologous protein secretion. In a systematic screening approach, all naturally occurring (non-lipoprotein) Sec-type signal peptides (SPs) from B. subtilis were characterized for their potential in heterologous protein secretion. Surprisingly, optimal SPs in cutinase secretion were inefficient in esterase secretion and vice versa, indicating the importance of an optimal fit between the SP and the respective mature part of the desired secretion target proteins. These results highlight the need for individually optimal signal peptides for every heterologous secretion target. Therefore, the SP library generated in this study represents a powerful tool for secretion optimization in Gram-positive expression hosts.
TI  - Cloning and expression of an alpha-1,3-glucanase gene from Bacillus circulans KA-304: the enzyme participates in protoplast formation of Schizophyllum commune.
AB  - A culture filtrate of Bacillus circulans KA-304 grown on a cell-wall preparation  of Schizophyllum commune has an activity to form protoplasts from S. commune mycelia, and a combination of alpha-1,3-glucanase and chitinase I, which were isolated from the filtrate, brings about the protoplast-forming activity. The gene of alpha-1,3-glucanase was cloned from B. circulans KA-304. It consists of 3,879 nucleotides, which encodes 1,293 amino acids including a putative signal peptide (31 amino acid residues), and the molecular weight of alpha-1,3-glucanase without the putative signal peptide was calculated to be 132,184. The deduced amino acid sequence of alpha-1,3-glucanase of B. circulans KA-304 showed approximately 80% similarity to that of mutanase (alpha-1,3-glucanase) of Bacillus sp. RM1, but no significant similarity to those of fungal mutanases. The recombinant alpha-1,3-glucanase was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami B (DE 3), and significant alpha-1,3-glucanase activity was detected in the cell-free extract of the organism treated with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The recombinant alpha-1,3-glucanase showed protoplast-forming activity when the enzyme was combined with chitinase I.
TI  - Expression and characterization of the genes encoding azoreductases from Bacillus subtilis and Geobacillus stearothermophilus.
AB  - Azoreductases have been characterized as enzymes that can decolorize azo dyes by  reducing azo groups. In this study, genes encoding proteins having homology with the azoreductase gene of Bacillus sp. OY1-2 were obtained from Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633, B. subtilis ISW1214, and Geobacillus stearotherophilus IFO13737 by polymerase chain reaction. All three genes encoded proteins with 174 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequences of azoreductase homologs from B. subtilis ISW1214, B. subtilis ATCC6633, and G. stearotherophilus IFO13737 showed similarity of 53.3, 53.9, and 53.3% respectively to that of Bacillus sp. OY1-2. All three genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, and were characterized as having the decolorizing activity of azo dyes in a beta-NADPH dependent manner. The transformation of several azo dyes into colorless compounds by recombinant enzymes was demonstrated to have distinct substrate specificity from that of azoreductase from Bacillus sp. OY1-2.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the African traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different DNA extraction methods.
AB  - The microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the Rep. of Congo) and degue (a millet dough from Burkina Faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using TTGE to separate the amplified target V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from total microbial community, followed by DNA sequencing and homology search. Three different extraction methods were used. Guanidium thiocyanate-based DNA extraction provided better performance regarding purity and DNA yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of DNA bands by TTGE in poto poto. By contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the DNA extraction method largely depends on the food composition. Sequencing of DNA bands from TTGE gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of Lactobacillus gasseri, Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei. The following bacteria were identified in degue: L. gasseri, Enterococcus sp., E. coli, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, and L. casei.
TI  - Characterization of an active spore photoproduct lyase, a DNA repair enzyme in the radical S-adenosylmethionine superfamily.
AB  - The major photoproduct in UV-irradiated Bacillus spore DNA is a unique thymine dimer called spore photoproduct (SP, 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine). The enzyme spore photoproduct lyase (SP lyase) has been found to catalyze the repair of SP dimers to thymine monomers in a reaction that requires S-adenosylmethionine. We present here the first detailed characterization of catalytically active SP lyase, which has been anaerobically purified from overexpressing Escherichia coli. Anaerobically purified SP lyase is monomeric and is red-brown in color. The purified enzyme contains approximately 3.1 iron and 3.0 acid-labile S(2-) per protein and has a UV-visible spectrum characteristic of iron-sulfur proteins (410 nm (11.9 mM(-1) cm(-1)) and 450 nm (10.5 mM(-1) cm(-1))). The X-band EPR spectrum of the purified enzyme shows a nearly isotropic signal (g = 2.02) characteristic of a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster; reduction of SP lyase with dithionite results in the appearance of a new EPR signal (g = 2.03, 1.93, and 1.89) with temperature dependence and g values consistent with its assignment to a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster. The reduced purified enzyme is active in SP repair, with a specific activity of 0.33 micromol/min/mg. Only a catalytic amount of S-adenosylmethionine is required for DNA repair, and no irreversible cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine into methionine and 5'-deoxyadenosine is observed during the reaction. Label transfer from [5'-3H]S-adenosylmethionine to repaired thymine is observed, providing evidence to support a mechanism in which a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical intermediate directly abstracts a hydrogen from SP C-6 to generate a substrate radical, and subsequent to radical-mediated beta-scission, a product thymine radical abstracts a hydrogen from 5'-deoxyadenosine to regenerate the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. Together, our results support a mechanism in which S-adenosylmethionine acts as a catalytic cofactor, not a substrate, in the DNA repair reaction.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of marine bacteria associated with sponges from the waters off the coast of South East India.
AB  - Seventy-five marine bacterial strains associated with four species of sponges (Echinodictyum sp., Spongia sp., Sigmadocia fibulatus and Mycale mannarensis) were isolated from the Tuticorin coast, Gulf of Mannar region. The agar-overlay method was used to screen for antibiotic production by these strains against four bacteria, viz., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio harveyi and one fungal pathogen, viz., Candida albicans. Twenty-one per cent of the bacterial strains were found to be antibiotic producers and their activities ranged from broad spectral to species specific. A strain coded SC3 was found to be highly potent and was mass cultured. The ethyl acetate extract of the culture broth was further fractionated by reverse phase HPLC and the active fraction identified. In addition, SC3 was subjected to morphological and physiological characterization. The results of the tests showed SC3 to be a Gram-positive rod, sporulating, motile, catalase and oxidase positive. Phylogenetic analysis based on comparative analysis of sequenced 16s rRNA of the active strains indicated a preponderance of bacteria belonging to Vibrio and Bacillus genera with 95-99% sequence similarities. To our knowledge this is the first report on phylogenetic identification of antibiotic producing bacteria associated with sponges from Indian waters.
TI  - Amino acid cost and codon-usage biases in 6 prokaryotic genomes: a whole-genome analysis.
AB  - For most prokaryotic organisms, amino acid biosynthesis represents a significant  portion of their overall energy budget. The difference in the cost of synthesis between amino acids can be striking, differing by as much as 7-fold. Two prokaryotic organisms, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, have been shown to preferentially utilize less costly amino acids in highly expressed genes, indicating that parsimony in amino acid selection may confer a selective advantage for prokaryotes. This study confirms those findings and extends them to 4 additional prokaryotic organisms: Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae AR39, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and Thermus thermophilus HB27. Adherence to codon-usage biases for each of these 6 organisms is inversely correlated with a coding region's average amino acid biosynthetic cost in a fashion that is independent of chemoheterotrophic, photoautotrophic, or thermophilic lifestyle. The obligate parasites C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae AR39 are incapable of synthesizing many of the 20 common amino acids. Removing auxotrophic amino acids from consideration in these organisms does not alter the overall trend of preferential use of energetically inexpensive amino acids in highly expressed genes.
TI  - Inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by thermoalkaliphilic F1Fo-ATP synthase is controlled by the C terminus of the epsilon subunit.
AB  - The F(1)F(o)-ATP synthases of alkaliphilic bacteria exhibit latent ATPase activity, and for the thermoalkaliphile Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1, this activity is intrinsic to the F(1) moiety. To study the mechanism of ATPase inhibition, we developed a heterologous expression system in Escherichia coli to produce TA2F(1) complexes from this thermoalkaliphile. Like the native F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase, the recombinant TA2F(1) was blocked in ATP hydrolysis activity, and this activity was stimulated by the detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide. To determine if the C-terminal domain of the epsilon subunit acts as an inhibitor of ATPase activity and if an electrostatic interaction plays a role, a TA2F(1) mutant with either a truncated epsilon subunit [i.e., TA2F(1)(epsilon(DeltaC))] or substitution of basic residues in the second alpha-helix of epsilon with nonpolar alanines [i.e., TA2F(1)(epsilon(6A))] was constructed. Both mutants showed ATP hydrolysis activity at low and high concentrations of ATP. Treatment of the purified F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase and TA2F(1)(epsilon(WT)) complex with proteases revealed that the epsilon subunit was resistant to proteolytic digestion. In contrast, the epsilon subunit of TA2F(1)(epsilon(6A)) was completely degraded by trypsin, indicating that the C-terminal arm was in a conformation where it was no longer protected from proteolytic digestion. In addition, ATPase activity was not further activated by protease treatment when compared to the untreated control, supporting the observation that epsilon was responsible for inhibition of ATPase activity. To study the effect of the alanine substitutions in the epsilon subunit in the entire holoenzyme, we reconstituted recombinant TA2F(1) complexes with F(1)-stripped native membranes of strain TA2.A1. The reconstituted TA2F(o)F(1)(epsilon(WT)) was blocked in ATP hydrolysis and exhibited low levels of ATP-driven proton pumping consistent with the F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase in native membranes. Reconstituted TA2F(o)F(1)(epsilon(6A)) exhibited ATPase activity that correlated with increased ATP-driven proton pumping, confirming that the epsilon subunit also inhibits ATPase activity of TA2F(o)F(1).
TI  - Identification of glutamate residues important for catalytic activity or thermostability of a truncated Bacillus sp. strain TS-23 alpha-amylase by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - The importance of 17 glutamate residues of a truncated Bacillus sp. strain TS-23  alpha-amylase (BACdeltaNC) was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. The Ala- and Asp-substituted variants were overexpressed in the recombinant E. coli cells and the 54-kDa proteins were purified to nearly homologous by nickel-chelate chromatography. Glu-295, which locates in the conserved region III of amylolytic enzymes, mutations resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity. The specific activity for E151A was decreased by more than 30%, while other variants showed activity comparable to that of BACdeltaNC. A decreased half-life at 70 degrees C was observed for Glu-219 variants with respective to the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that replacement of Glu-219 by either Ala or Asp might have a significant destabilizing effect on the protein structure.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Construction and characterization of nisin-controlled expression vectors for use  in Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - The Nisin-controlled gene expression (NICE) system, which was discovered in Lactococcus lactis, was adapted to Lactobacillus reuteri by ligating nisA promoter (PnisA) and nisRK DNA fragments into the Escherichia coli-Lb. reuteri shuttle vector pSTE32. This chimerical plasmid (pNICE) was capable of expressing the heterologous amylase gene (amyL) under nisin induction. Optimization of induction factors for this Lb. reuteri/pNICE system, including nisin concentration (viz. 50 ng/ml), growth phase of culture at which nisin be added (viz. at the early exponential phase), and the best time for analyzing the gene product after inoculation (viz. at the 3rd h), allowed the amylase product to be expressed in high amounts, constituting up to about 18% of the total intracellular protein. Furthermore, the signal peptide (SP) of amyL gene (SPamyL) from Bacillus licheniformis was ligated to the downstream of PnisA in pNICE, upgrading this vector to a NICE-secretion (NIES) level, which was then designated pNIES (Sec+, secretion positive). Characterization of pNIES using an amyL-SPDelta gene (amyL gene lacking its SP) as a reporter revealed the 3rd h after induction as the secretion peak of this system, at which the secretion efficiency and the amount of alpha-amylase being secreted into the culture supernatant were estimated to reach 77.6% and 27.75 mg/l. Expression and secretion of AmyL products by pNIES in Lb. reuteri was also confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis.
TI  - Structural analysis of N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase apoenzyme from Escherichia coli.
AB  - We report the crystal structure of the apoenzyme of N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc6P) deacetylase from Escherichia coli (EcNAGPase) and the spectrometric evidence of the presence of Zn2+ in the native protein. The GlcNAc6P deacetylase is an enzyme of the amino sugar catabolic pathway that catalyzes the conversion of the GlcNAc6P into glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN6P). The crystal structure was phased by the single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) method using low-resolution (2.9 A) iodine anomalous scattering and it was refined against a native dataset up to 2.0 A resolution. The structure is similar to two other NAGPases whose structures are known from Thermotoga maritima (TmNAGPase) and Bacillus subtilis (BsNAGPase); however, it shows a phosphate ion bound at the metal-binding site. Compared to these previous structures, the apoenzyme shows extensive conformational changes in two loops adjacent to the active site. The E. coli enzyme is a tetramer and its dimer-dimer interface was analyzed. The tetrameric structure was confirmed in solution by small-angle X-ray scattering data. Although no metal ions were detected in the present structure, experiments of photon-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) spectra and of inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) with enzyme that was neither exposed to chelating agents nor metal ions during purification, revealed the presence of 1.4 atoms of Zn per polypeptide chain. Enzyme inactivation by metal-sequestering agents and subsequent reactivation by the addition of several divalent cations, demonstrate the role of metal ions in EcNAGPase structure and catalysis.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch heartwood lignans.
AB  - Five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an MeOH extract from Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria Citrobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi Mucor miehei, Paecilomyces variotii, Ceratocystis pilifera, Trametes versicolor, and Penicillium notatum, and in addition, the MeOH extract was evaluated against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium moniliforme, F. sporotrichum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the Gram-positive. However, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of T. versicolor and C. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the MeOH extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as T. versicolor, Fusarium spp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
TI  - CO2 supply induces the growth of Symbiobacterium thermophilum, a syntrophic bacterium.
AB  - Symbiobacterium thermophilum is a unique syntrophic bacterium that exhibits marked growth only in coculture with a cognate Bacillus sp. In this study, we found that the bacterium is capable of marked mono-growth when supplied with CO2 or bicarbonate. The evidence suggests that the genetic defect for carbonic anhydrase in this bacterium is a reason for the syntrophic property based on CO2 requirement.
TI  - [Cloning and expression of the alpha-amylase gene from a Bacillus sp. WS06, and characterization of the enzyme].
AB  - A Bacillus sp. WS06, which produces an extracellular alpha-amylase, was isolated  from the cecum in a piglet. An amyF gene from this Bacillus strain was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. An open reading frame composed of 1581 bases, which encodes 526 amino acid residues was found. The amyF gene shows high sequence homologies with other microbial amylase genes, such as Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus polymyxa (93% and 53% identity). The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that four highly conserved regions of the alpha-amylase family. The amyF gene was overepressed using the pET21a vector and Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant enzyme was purified 22.2 fold to electrophoretic homogeneity and had a molecular mass of 57kD (by SDS-PAGE). The enzyme was optimally active at pH 7 and 55 approximately 60 degrees C and showed stability at the temperature below 55 degrees C. This enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed various types of starch to yield a series of malto-oligosaccharides by endo-cleavage mode.
TI  - Detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  - AIM: To detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  METHODS: A rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. Target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. When this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. CONCLUSION: Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp., Bacillus cereus, Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. The accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or cost.
TI  - bph genes of the thermophilic PCB degrader, Bacillus sp. JF8: characterization of the divergent ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase and hydrolase genes upstream of the Mn-dependent BphC.
AB  - Bacillus sp. JF8 is a thermophilic polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) degrader, which utilizes biphenyl and naphthalene. A thermostable, Mn-dependent 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase, BphC_JF8, has been characterized previously. Upstream of bphC are five ORFs exhibiting low homology with, and a different gene order from, previously characterized bph genes. From the 5' to 3' direction the genes are: a putative regulatory gene (bphR), a hydrolase (bphD), the large and small subunits of a ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase (bphA1A2), and a cis-diol dehydrogenase (bphB). Hybridization studies indicate that the genes are located on a plasmid. Ring-hydroxylating activity of recombinant BphA1A2_JF8 towards biphenyl, PCB, naphthalene and benzene was observed in Escherichia coli cells, with complementation of non-specific ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase by host cell proteins. PCB degradation by recombinant BphA1A2_JF8 showed that the congener specificity of the recombinant enzyme was similar to Bacillus sp. JF8. BphD_JF8, with an optimum temperature of 85 degrees C, exhibited a narrow substrate preference for 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid. The Arrhenius plot of BphD_JF8 was biphasic, with two characteristic energies of activation and a break point at 47 degrees C.
TI  - Quick selection of a chimeric T2 phage that displays active enzyme on the viral capsid.
AB  - We designed a bacteriophage T2 system to display proteins fused at the N-terminus of the head protein small outer capsid (SOC) of a T2 phage. To facilitate selection of chimeric phage, a T2 phage encoding the beta-galactosidase gene (betagal) upstream of the soc gene was constructed. The phage, named T2betaGal, produces blue plaques on agar plates containing XGal. Subsequently, a plasmid encoding the target protein upstream of soc was constructed and used to transform E. coli B(E) cells. Transformed cells were infected with T2betaGal and homologous recombination between phage DNA and the plasmid resulted in a chimeric phage that produced transparent plaques due to the excision of the betagal gene. Chitosanase of Bacillus sp. strain K17 (ChoK), consisting of 453 amino acids, was used as a model target protein. Recombinant T2 phage that produced ChoK was named T2ChoK. T2ChoK was produced from T2betaGal at a recombination frequency of about 0.1%. On the other hand, the value for T2betaGal produced from wild-type T2 was 0.001 %. This new system enables us to select recombinant phage very quickly and accurately. The number of molecules of ChoK was calculated at 14.7 per single phage. Latent period and burst size were estimated for the chimeric phages.
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis and biochemical characterization of a thermostable dihydropyrimidinase from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. TS-23.
AB  - Two degenerate primers established from the alignment of highly conserved amino acid sequences of bacterial dihydropyrimidinases (DHPs) were used to amplify a 330-bp gene fragment from the genomic DNA of Bacillus sp. TS-23 and the amplified DNA was successfully used as a probe to clone a dhp gene from the strain. The open reading frame of the gene consisted of 1422 bp and was deduced to contain 472 amino acids with a molecular mass of 52 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited greater than 45% identity with that of prokaryotic D-hydantoinases and eukaryotic DHPs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Bacillus sp. TS-23 DHP is grouped together with Bacillus stearothermophilus D-hydantoinase and related to dihydroorotases and allantoinases from various organisms. His6-tagged DHP was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography to a specific activity of 3.46 U mg(-1) protein. The optimal pH and temperature for the purified enzyme were 8.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The half-life of His6-tagged DHP was 25 days at 50 degrees C. The enzyme activity was stimulated by Co2+ and Mn2+ ions. His6-tagged DHP was most active toward dihydrouracil followed by hydantoin derivatives. The catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of the enzyme for dihydrouracil and hydantoin were 2.58 and 0.61 s(-1) mM(-1), respectively.
TI  - Screening of actinomycetes isolated from soil samples of Ajmer, Rajasthan for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Several strains of actinomycetes were isolated from soil samples collected from various localities ofAjmer district. These isolates were tested for their antagonistic proerties against few test organisms viz. Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger. Some of these actinomycete strains exhibited antimicrobial activity against bacteria, no antifungal activity was observed. Six such isolates were selected for detailed morphological, cultural, physiological and biochemical studies for identification. Five of these were identified as members beloging to the genus Streptomyces and the remaining one belonging to the genus Actinoplanes.
TI  - Antimicrobial, cytotoxic and antioxidant activity of selected basidiomycetes from Yemen.
AB  - Dichloromethane, methanol and aqueous extracts of 23 selected Basidiomycetes species fruiting bodies collected in Yemen were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activities against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus flavus), two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and against one yeast fungus (Candida maltosa), as well as for their cytotoxic and antioxidant activity. The highest antibacterial activity was shown by extracts from Agaricus sp. (Type 1), Coriolopsis caperata, Ganoderma colossus, Ganoderma resinaceum, Phellorinia herculea and Tulostoma obesum. Strong antioxidative effects employing the DPPH assay were exhibited by methanol extracts from Ganoderma resinaceum, Inonotus ochroporus, Phellinus rimosus and Phellorinia herculea. The results provide evidence that some of the studied fungi might be potential sources for new biologically active agents.
TI  - Microbial surface thermodynamics and interactions in aqueous media.
AB  - Microbial surface thermodynamics and interactions in aqueous media were investigated for seven typical rod-shaped bacterial strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceas, and Bacillaceae, which included Escherichia coli HB101, Escherichia coli JM109, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas sp., and Bacillus subtilis. All the microorganisms studied exhibited a monopolar and predominant hydrophilic surface and a negative Delta G132tot, total free energy of interactions between microbes (1) and silica gel or Canadian River Alluvium (CRA) (2) immersed in water (3) at the equilibrium distance, which accounted for their attachment on the medium surface. The microbial attachment was proportional to the corresponding Delta G132tot values. Among the microorganisms studied, B. subtilis had the most attachment on both silica gel and CRA because it had the smallest Delta G132tot values (-17.14kT for silica gel and -21.84kT for CRA). The origins of Lifshitz-van der Waals, Lewis acid/base, and electrostatic interactions were discussed and related to experimental observations.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of kojibiose phosphorylase gene from Thermoanaerobacter brockii ATCC35047.
AB  - A gene encoding kojibiose phosphorylase was cloned from Thermoanaerobacter brockii ATCC35047. The kojP gene encodes a polypeptide of 775 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence was homologous to those of trehalose phosphorylase from T. brockii and maltose phosphorylases from Bacillus sp. and Lactobacillus brevis with 35%, 29% and 28% identities, respectively. Kojibiose phosphorylase was efficiently overexpressed in Escherichia coli JM109. The DNA sequence of 3956 bp analyzed in this study contains three open reading frames (ORFs) downstream of kojP. The four ORFs, kojP, kojE, kojF, and kojG, form a gene cluster. The amino acid sequences deduced from kojE and kojF are similar to those of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of a sugar-binding periplasmic protein from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis MB4. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence deduced from kojG is similar to that of a permease of the ABC-type sugar transport systems from T. tengcongensis MB4. Each of three amino acid substitutions, D362N, K614Q and E642Q, caused a complete loss of kojibiose phosphorylase activity. These results suggest that D362, K614 and E642 play an important role in catalysis. Another mutation, D459N, increased K(m) values for kojibiose (7-fold that for the wild type), beta-G1P (11-fold) and glucose (7-fold), whereas K(m) for inorganic phosphate was minimally affected by this mutation, suggesting that D459 may be involved in the binding to saccharides.
TI  - Aldoxime dehydratase co-existing with nitrile hydratase and amidase in the iron-type nitrile hydratase-producer Rhodococcus sp. N-771.
AB  - We identified an aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) gene in the 5'-flanking region of the nitrile hydratase-amidase gene cluster in the photoreactive iron-type nitrile hydratase-producer, Rhodococcus sp. N-771. The enzyme showed 96.3%, 77.6%, and 30.4% identities with the Oxds of Rhodococcus globerulus A-4, Pseudomonas chlororaphis B23, and Bacillus sp. OxB-1, respectively. The enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the lac- or T7 promoters in its intact and His6-tagged forms, purified, and characterized. The enzyme had heme b as a prosthetic group, catalyzed a stoichiometric dehydration of aldoxime into nitrile, and exhibited the highest activity at neutral pH and at around 30 degrees C similar to the known Oxd from Bacillus sp. OxB-1. The activity was enhanced by reducing agents, such as Na2S, Na2S2(O4), 2-mercaptoethanol, and L-cysteine and supplementary additions of electron acceptors such as flavins, sulfite ion, and vitamin K3. The effect of various chemicals on the enzyme activity was different in the presence and absence of the reducing reagent, Na2S. The enzyme preferentially acts on aliphatic-type substrates and the substrate specificity of the enzyme coincides with that reported for nitrile hydratase produced by the strain.
TI  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase from Bacillus sp. INT005 is composed of PhaC and PhaR.
AB  - A polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis gene locus from Bacillus sp. INT005 strain, which had been isolated from a gas field, was cloned and analyzed at the molecular level. We found that a 3.8-kbp DraI-digested fragment of genomic DNA of Bacillus sp. INT005 conferred PHA-producing ability to Escherichia coli, which was PHA-negative. The DNA fragment contained three genes, phaR, -B and -C. The activity of 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase with NADPH was detected in the lysate from recombinant E. coli carrying the phaB gene. Although PHA synthase activity could be detected in the extract from E. coli carrying phaR, -B and -C genes, no such activity could be detected in that from E. coli carrying only the phaC gene. However, the mixture of the crude extracts of E. coli expressing phaR or phaC revealed very high PHA synthase activity. Furthermore, when His-tagged PhaC was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography from the mixture of crude extracts containing His-tagged PhaC or native PhaR, the eluate contained His-tagged PhaC and native PhaR. On the other hand, PhaR did not bind to the column directly. This purified PhaC with PhaR had 160-fold higher specific activity of PHA synthase than that without PhaR. In addition, the kinetics of the purified PhaC with PhaR revealed a lag phase that preceded the linear phase. It has been known that class III PHA synthase is composed of two different subunits, PhaC and PhaE, and phaC and phaE genes are directly linked in the genomes. Furthermore, the PHA synthase has no lag phase. We hence concluded that the PHA synthase of Bacillus sp. INT005 consists of PhaC and PhaR, and has characteristics different from class III PHA synthase.
TI  - Alteration of product specificity of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase from Thermococcus sp. B1001 by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus sp. B1001 catalyzed the production predominantly of alpha-cyclodextrin (CD) from starch (Tachibana, Y. et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 65, 1991-1997, 1999). The CGTase gene (cgtA) from this strain was cloned and sequenced. It was composed of 2217 nucleotides, and encoded a protein (739 amino acids) with a molecular mass of 83,240 Da. Recombinant CgtA expressed in Escherichia coli also catalyzed the production predominantly of alpha-CD from starch, as did native CgtA from strain B1001. Based on a substrate binding model of Bacillus circulans no. 8 CGTase, Tyr100, Trp191 and Tyr267 were specified to locate the spiral amylose and to minimize the size of the CD by saccharide aromatics interaction. In order to determine the critical residue for catalyzing production predominantly of alpha-CD, site-directed mutations were introduced in CgtA (Y100W, Tyr100-->Trp; W191Y, Trp191-->Tyr; W191F, Trp191-->Phe; Y267W, Tyr267-->Trp; Y267F, Tyr267-->Phe). Analysis of the reaction products by HPLC revealed that the mutant enzyme Y267W produced more beta- and gamma-CD than the wild-type enzyme. However, the other mutants still produced high levels of alpha-CD, suggesting that Tyr267 plays a critical role in alpha-CD production catalyzed by B1001 CGTase.
TI  - Purification, crystallization, and properties of F1-ATPase complexes from the thermoalkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1.
AB  - Recently, we reported the cloning of the atp operon encoding for the F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase from the extremely thermoalkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1. In this study, the genes encoding the F(1) moiety of the enzyme complex were cloned from the atp operon into the vector pTrc99A and expressed in Escherichia coli in two variant complexes, F(1)-wt consisting of subunits alpha(3)beta(3)gammadeltaepsilon and F(1)Deltadelta lacking the entire delta-subunit as a prerequisite for overproduction and crystallization trials. Both F(1)-wt and F(1)Deltadelta were successfully overproduced in E. coli and purified in high yield and purity. F(1)Deltadelta was crystallized by micro-batch screening yielding three-dimensional crystals that diffracted to a resolution of 3.1A using a synchrotron radiation source. After establishing cryo and dehydrating conditions, a complete set of diffraction data was collected from a single crystal. No crystals were obtained with F(1)-wt. Data processing of diffraction patterns showed that F(1)Deltadelta crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell parameters of a=121.70, b=174.80, and c=223.50A, alpha, beta, gamma=90.000. The asymmetric unit contained one molecule of bacterial F(1)Deltadelta with a corresponding volume per protein weight (V(M)) of 3.25A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 62.1%. Silver staining of single crystals of F(1)Deltadelta analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealed four bands alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon with identical M(r)-values as those found in the native F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase isolated from strain TA2.A1 membranes. ATPase assays of F(1)Deltadelta crystals exhibited latent ATP hydrolytic activity that was highly stimulated by lauryldimethylamine oxide, a hallmark of the native enzyme.
TI  - [Microbiologic evaluation of enteral diets handled in a hospital].
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the microbiological quality of open enteral feeding system manipulated in a specialized hospital in oncology in the city of Natal-RN. METHODS: 20 samples of industrialized enteral feeding in open system had been analyzed. The searched microrganisms had been: Bacillus cereus, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp, Clostridium sulfite reducer, mesophilic aerobic bacteria and coagulase positive Staphylococci. The methodology used for accomplishment of the microbiological analyses was the praised one for the Food and Drug Administration--FDA. RESULTS: It was evidenced total coliforms, Escherichia coli and mesophilic aerobic bacteria contamination in 25%, 10% and 20% of the analyzed samples, respectively. It was not identified the presence of Bacillus cereus, Salmonella sp, Clostridium sulfite reducer, and coagulase positive Staphylococci in none of the analyzed samples. CONCLUSION: The gotten results show that the enteral feedings are in unsatisfactory hygienic-sanitary conditions, evidencing the necessity of a bigger control in the manipulation of the same ones.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of hemolytic bacteria, depending on iron content in bacterial cells].
AB  - The study of sensitivity to antibiotic substances of different chemical structure and the mechanism of the antimicrobial action of hemolytic bacteria Bacillus sp., Corynebacterium sp. and Escherichia coli under the condition of high iron content in bacterial cells was carried out. An increase in antimicrobial resistance of iron-loaded Gram-positive bacteria, in contrast to Gram-negative ones, was shown.
TI  - Construction of chimeric cyclodextrin glucanotransferases from Bacillus circulans A11 and Paenibacillus macerans IAM1243 and analysis of their product specificity.
AB  - Three DNA fragments of 7919 base pairs containing genes for beta-cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19), an iron III dicitrate transport protein-like protein and a partial coding sequence for putative ferrichrome ABC transporter from Bacillus circulans A11 were cloned and sequenced (GenBank Accession AF302787). The DNA sequence contained a CGTase open reading frame of 2139 base pairs, which encoded a polypeptide of 713 amino acid residues. The signal peptide constituted the N-terminal 27 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence was highly homologous to that of Bacillus sp. 1011 with 98.7% identity. The cloned CGTase gene contained its own promoter that directed the expression of the gene in Escherichia coli host cells. Chimeric construction against the alpha-CGTase from B. macerans IAM1243 was carried out by means of three created restriction sites, XhoI, SpeI, and MfeI, introduced by mutagenesis in between domains A/B and C, C and D, and D and E, respectively, and the NdeI site within the domains A/B. The various chimeras with different combinations of domains and part of domains A/B were analyzed for their dextrinizing and CD-forming activities. Their activities were of three groups: chimeras with no dextrinizing and cyclization activities, chimeras with only dextrinizing activity, and chimeras with both dextrinizing and cyclization activities. Two chimeras in the latter group showed altered product specificity. The results located the amino acid segment essential for the product specificity at the C-terminal half of domains A/B. Further, the function of domains C and D in positioning domain E in the correct orientation and proximity to domains A/B is implicated.
TI  - Construction and one-step purification of Bacillus kaustophilus leucine aminopeptidase fused to the starch-binding domain of Bacillus sp. strain TS-23 alpha-amylase.
AB  - The starch-binding domain of Bacillus sp. strain TS-23 alpha-amylase was introduced into the C-terminal end of Bacillus kaustophilus leucine aminopeptidase (BkLAP) to generate a chimeric enzyme (BkLAPsbd) with raw-starch-binding activity. BkLAPsbd, with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 65 kDa, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli M15 cells and purified to homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography. Native PAGE and chromatographic analyses revealed that the purified fusion protein has a hexameric structure. The half-life for BkLAPsbd was 12 min at 70 degrees C, while less than 20% of wild-type enzyme activity retained at the same heating condition. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, the 60% decrease in the catalytic efficiency of BkLAPsbd was due to a 91% increase in K (m) value. Starch-binding assays showed that the K (d) and B (max) values for the fusion enzyme were 2.3 microM and 0.35 micromol/g, respectively. The adsorption of the crude BkLAPsbd onto raw starch was affected by starch concentration, pH, and temperature. The adsorbed enzyme could be eluted from the adsorbent by 2% soluble starch in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). About 49% of BkLAPsbd in the crude extract was recovered through one adsorption-elution cycle with a purification of 11.4-fold.
TI  - [Expression and bioactive characterization of bacteriophage lysin gene of Bacillus anthracis in Escherichia coli].
AB  - The lysin gene of Bacillus anthracis-diagnosing bacteriophage, obtained by PCR amplification,was cloned into the Escherichia coli exepression vector pET22b which has been cleaved by EcoR I and Nde I. The recombinant vector pET22b-gamma lysin was verified to be correctly constructed by PCR, sequencing and enzyme digestion, and highly expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), which accounted for about 40 percent of total protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3), while in the 5L fermentor the expression level reached 15g/L. After expression, disruption and purification with three-step chromatography, Streamline SP, SP HP and Sephacryl S-100, the recombinant gamma lysin was finally obtained with purity of higher than 95 percent as determined by gel scan. The final yield following SP HP was 19.1 percent, with a greater-than-350-fold increase in specific activity. The pure enzyme has been shown active to Bacillus anthracis, and not to E. coli, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. Its specific activity was about 1400 u/mg.
TI  - Efficient constitutive expression of Bacillus subtilis xylanase A in Escherichia  coli DH5alpha under the control of the Bacillus BsXA promoter.
AB  - Xylanase A (XynA) is a class G/11 xylanase secreted by Bacillus subtilis. XynA was purified to homogeneity from B. subtilis strain 168 culture supernatants by ethanol precipitation and cation-exchange chromatography. The DNA fragment encoding the XynA together with the BsXA promoter region was amplified by PCR from B. subtilis 168 genomic DNA, and cloned into the plasmid pT7T3 to give the plasmid pT7BsXA. After transformation of Escherichia coli DH5alpha with pT7BsXA, a 19-fold increase in the levels of the secreted XynA was detected in the supernatant as compared with the B. subtilis culture. Correct post-translation modification of the recombinant protein was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and MS analyses. The pH- and temperature-dependences of the native and recombinant proteins were identical, indicating that the pT7BsXA may be useful for the constitutive expression of heterologous protein in E. coli.
TI  - [Construction of a secreting prokaryotic shuttle expressing plasmid pBCG-sP-HSP65 and its expression in Mycobacterial smegmatis].
AB  - To construct the secretive prokaryotic shuttle expression plasmid pBCG-SP-HSP65,  the signal peptide sequence of antigen 85B amplified from Bacillus Calmette-guerin (BCG) genome by PCR and the whole HSP65 DNA sequence of human M. tuberculosis obtained from the plasmid pCMV-MTHSP65 by PCR were cloned into the plasmid pBCG-2100 under the control of the promoter of Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) from human M. tuberculosis. Recombinants were electroporated into Mycobacterial smegmatis and induced by heating. Results of the induced expression were detected by SDS-PAGE and the biological activity of the expressed protein was tested by Western-blot analysis. Results showed pBCG-SP-MTHSP65 was constructed successfully and confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis, PCR detection and DNA sequencing analysis. After it was electroporated into Mycobacterial smegmatis and induced by heating, the percentage of expressed 65kD protein in Mycobacterial smegmatis detected by SDS-PAGE was 20% in total bacterial protein. But the percentage of expressed 65kD protein in recombibinant Mycobacterial smegmatis was up to 34.46% in total bacterial protein and 68.56% in the total protein of cell lysate supernants, Which demonstrated the recombinant HSP65 gene could express in recombinant with high efficiency and the expressed proteins were mainly soluble. Western-blot showed that the secretive proteins could specially combine with antibody against human M. tuberculosis HSP65. Orally, pBCG-SP-HSP65 was successfully constructed; HSP65 gene could express in Mycobacterial smegmatis with high efficiency via it. And the expressed proteins possess the biological activity. So it provids experimental evidence for the application of the recombinant Mycobacterial smegmatis and the development of the vaccine against tuberculosis.
TI  - The crystal structure of Mlc, a global regulator of sugar metabolism in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Mlc from Escherichia coli is a transcriptional repressor controlling the expression of a number of genes encoding enzymes of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), including ptsG and manXYZ, the specific enzyme II for glucose and mannose PTS transporters. In addition, Mlc controls the transcription of malT, the gene of the global activator of the mal regulon. The inactivation of Mlc as a repressor is mediated by binding to an actively transporting PtsG (EIICB(Glc)). Here we report the crystal structure of Mlc at 2.7 A resolution representing the first described structure of an ROK (repressors, open reading frames, and kinases) family protein. Mlc forms stable dimers thus explaining its binding affinity to palindromic operator sites. The N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain of Mlc is stabilized by the amphipathic C-terminal helix implicated earlier in EIICB(Glc) binding. Furthermore, the structure revealed a metal-binding site within the cysteine-rich ROK consensus motif that coordinates a structurally important zinc ion. A strongly reduced repressor activity was observed when two of the zinc-coordinating cysteine residues were exchanged against serine or alanine, demonstrating the role of zinc in Mlc-mediated repressor function. The structures of a putative fructokinase from Bacillus subtilis, the glucokinase from Escherichia coli, and a glucomannokinase from Arthrobacter sp. showed high structural homology to the ROK family part of Mlc.
TI  - Identification, cloning and expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ps-x putative urate oxidase gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - In a previous study we reported for the first time the isolation and characterization ofurate oxidase enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this work we isolated and cloned a 1.350 kilobase DNA fragment that encode a putative urate oxidase gene from the genomic library of P. aeruginosa Ps-x. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA insert revealed an open reading frame that encodes a protein of a molecular weight of 54.0 kDa. The cloned DNA fragment showed an uricolytic activity when expressed in E. coli DH5alpha. Surprisingly, the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene showed more than 99% identity to the gene encoding hypothetical protein of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Moreover, the sequence of the cloned gene was closely similar to the corresponding uricase gene of Cellulomonas flavigena (44% similarity), but showed lower similarity values to that of Bacillus sp. BT-90 (24% similarity), Candida utilis (24% similarity). Interestingly, the isolated uricase gene showed closer similarity to uricase from yeast-like symbiotic fungi Beauveria bassiana (35%), Tolypocladium inflatum (29%), Paecilomyces tenuipes (27%) and Cerataphis fransseni (24%).
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - BzdR, a repressor that controls the anaerobic catabolism of benzoate in Azoarcus  sp. CIB, is the first member of a new subfamily of transcriptional regulators.
AB  - In this work, we have studied the transcriptional regulation of the bzd operon involved in the anaerobic catabolism of benzoate in the denitrifying Azoarcus sp. strain CIB. The transcription start site of the P(N) promoter running the expression of the bzd catabolic genes was identified. Gel retardation assays and P(N)::lacZ translational fusion experiments performed both in Azoarcus sp. CIB and Escherichia coli cells have shown that bzdR encodes a specific repressor that controls the inducible expression of the adjacent bzd catabolic operon, being the first intermediate of the catabolic pathway (i.e. benzoyl-CoA, the actual inducer molecule). This is the first report of a transcriptional repressor and a CoA-derived aromatic inducer controlling gene expression in the anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds. DNase I footprinting experiments revealed that BzdR protected three regions (operators) at the P(N) promoter. The three operators contain direct repetitions of a TGCA sequence that forms part of longer palindromic structures. In agreement with the repressor role of BzdR, operator region I spans the transcription initiation site as well as the -10 sequence for recognition of the RNA polymerase. Primary sequence analyses of BzdR showed an unusual modular organization with an N-terminal region homologous to members of the HTH-XRE family of transcriptional regulators and a C-terminal region similar to shikimate kinases. A three-dimensional model of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of BzdR, generated by comparison with the crystal structures of the SinR regulator from Bacillus subtilis and the shikimate kinase I protein from E. coli, strongly suggests that they contain the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and the benzoyl-CoA binding groove, respectively. The BzdR protein constitutes, therefore, the prototype of a new subfamily of transcriptional regulators.
TI  - Cloning, recombinant expression and biochemical characterisation of novel esterases from Bacillus sp. associated with the marine sponge Aplysina aerophoba.
AB  - Two novel esterases (EstB1 and EstB2) were isolated from a genomic library of Bacillus sp. associated with the marine sponge Aplysina aerophoba. EstB1 shows low identity (26-44%) with the published hydrolases of the genus Bacillus, whereas EstB2 shows high identity (73-74%) with the carboxylesterases from B. cereus and B. anthracis. Both esterases were efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of T7 promoter using the vector pET-22b(+). Recombinant EstB1 was purified in a single step to electrophoretic homogeneity by IMAC. A method for the refolding of inclusion bodies formed by the recombinant EstB2 was established to obtain active enzyme. Substrate specificity of the two enzymes towards p-nitrophenyl and methyl esters and the respective kinetic parameters K(m) and V(max) were determined. The temperature optima of EstB1 and EstB2 were determined to be in the range of 30-50 degrees C and 20-35 degrees C, respectively. The pH optima were found to be in the range of 6.5-7.5 and 6.5-8.0, respectively. Both enzymes showed the highest stability in up to 50% (v/v) DMSO followed by methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol. The influence of high NaCl and KCl concentrations was tested. The inhibition effect of 10-50 mM Zn(2+) and 50 mM Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) ions was observed for both esterases. One to five millimolar PMSF deactivated the enzymes, whereas beta-mercaptoethanol, DTT and EDTA had no effect on the enzymes activity.
TI  - Antibacterial and xanthine oxidase inhibitory cerebrosides from Fusarium sp. IFB-121, an endophytic fungus in Quercus variabilis.
AB  - Two antibacterial and xanthine oxidase inhibitory cerebrosides, one of which is chemically new, were characterized from the chloroform-methanol (1:1) extract of Fusarium sp. IFB-121, an endophytic fungus in Quercus variabilis. By means of chemical and spectral methods [IR, electrospray ionization MS (ESI-MS), tandem ESI-MS, 1H and 13C NMR, distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer, COSY, heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence, heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation, and 2-D nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy], the structure of the new metabolite named fusaruside was established as (2S,2'R,3R,3'E,4E,8E,10E)-1-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-2-N-(2'-hydroxy-3'-octadeceno yl)-3-hydroxy-9-methyl-4,8,10-sphingatrienine, and the structure of the other was identified as (2S,2'R,3R,3'E,4E,8E)-1-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-2-N-(2'-hydroxy-3'-octadecenoyl)- 3-hydroxy-9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine. Both new and known cerebrosides, although inactive to Trichophyton rubrum and Candida albicans, showed strong antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas fluorescens, with their minimum inhibitory concentrations being 3.9, 3.9, and 1.9 microg/mL, and 7.8, 3.9, and 7.8 microg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, both metabolites were inhibitory to xanthine oxidase, with the IC50 value of fusaruside being 43.8 +/- 3.6 microM and the known cerebroside being 55.5 +/- 1.8 microM.
TI  - Development of a hybrid delta-endotoxin and its expression in tobacco and cotton  for control of a polyphagous pest Spodoptera litura.
AB  - A hybrid delta-endotoxin protein was designed against a polyphagous lepidopteran  insect pest Spodoptera litura, which is tolerant to most of the known delta-endotoxins. The hybrid delta-endotoxin was created by replacing amino acid residues 530-587 in a poorly active natural Cry1Ea protein, with a highly homologous 70 amino acid region of Cry1Ca in domain III. The truncated delta-endotoxins Cry1Ea, Cry1Ca and the hybrid protein Cry1EC accumulated in Escherichia coli to form inclusion bodies. The solubilised Cry1EC made from E. coli was 4- fold more toxic to the larvae of S. litura than Cry1Ca, the best known delta-endotoxin against Spodoptera sp. None of the two truncated toxins, solubilised from E. coli caused larval mortality. However, trypsinised Cry1Ca protoxin obtained from E. coli and solubilised from inclusion bodies caused mortality of S. litura with LC50 513 ng/ml semi synthetic diet. A synthetic gene coding for the hybrid delta-endotoxin Cry1EC was designed for high level expression in plants, taking into consideration several features found in the highly expressed plant genes. Transgenic, single copy plants of tobacco as well as cotton were developed. The selected lines expressed Cry1EC at 0.1-0.7% of soluble leaf protein. Such plants were completely resistant to S. litura and caused 100% mortality in all stages of larval development. Hence, unlike in E. coli, the hybrid delta-endotoxin folded into a functionally active conformation in both tobacco and cotton leaves. The truncated Cry1EC expressed in tobacco leaves was about 8-fold more toxic (LC50 58 ng/ml diet) compared to expression in E. coli.
TI  - New luffariellolide derivatives from the Indonesian sponge Acanthodendrilla sp.
AB  - Investigation of the Indonesian sponge Acanthodendrilla sp. afforded five new luffariellolide-related sesterterpenes, acantholides A-E (1-5), in addition to luffariellolide and its 25-O-methyl and 25-O-ethyl derivatives. All structures were unambiguously established by 1D and 2D NMR and MS spectroscopy. Acantholide D and E are derivatives comprising the 1-acetylcyclopentan-5-ol moiety, which are new variants of the C(14)-C(20) segment for this type of linear sesterterpenes. Luffariellolide and its 25-O-methyl congener as well as acantholide E (5) were cytotoxic against the mouse lymphoma L5187Y cell line. Acantholide B (2), luffariellolide, and its 25-O-methyl congener were active against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, the yeast Candida albicans, and the plant pathogenic fungus Cladosporium herbarum.
TI  - Expression and secretion of a prokaryotic protein streptokinase without glycosylation and degradation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
AB  - Streptokinase (SK) is an important thrombolytic protein that is secreted by pathogenic strains of Streptococcus. Expression of streptokinase has been so far attempted in Pichia pastoris, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and shown to yield protein that was either highly glycosylated or degraded. Since the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, shares several molecular characteristics with higher eukaryotes, we decided to express the streptokinase gene in this yeast. A chimeric gene comprising the signal sequence of the Plus pheromone of Sz. pombe fused in-frame with the mature streptokinase from Streptococcus sp. was constructed and inserted into the expression vector containing the thiamine-regulated promoter. We obtained a high level of expression of streptokinase comparable to that in E. coli and P. pastoris, with 50-100% processing of the signal sequence and secretion of the mature streptokinase into the periplasmic fraction. The mature enzyme co-migrates with the authentic mature SK in SDS gels, lacks any major modification and is functional. Importantly, a higher level of expression under stationary phase conditions and improved extractability of the mature and undegraded streptokinase was achieved in a novel mutant of Sz. pombe defective for a potent extracellular protease activity. We suggest that the unique vector/strain system developed here could be advantageous for large-scale production of prokaryotic proteins without significant modification or degradation in Sz. pombe.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a beta-1,4-endoglucanase from an endophytic Bacillus pumilus strain.
AB  - Endophytes comprise mainly microorganisms that colonize inner plant tissues, often living with the host in a symbiotic manner. Several ecological roles have been assigned to endophytic fungi and bacteria, such as antibiosis to phytopathogenic agents and plant growth promotion. Nowadays, endophytes are viewed as a new source of genes, proteins and biochemical compounds that may be used to improve industrial processes. In this study, the gene EglA was cloned from a citrus endophytic Bacillus strain. The EglA encodes a beta-1,4-endoglucanase capable of hydrolyzing cellulose under in vitro conditions. The predicted protein, EglA, has high homology to other bacterial cellulases and shows a modular structure containing a catalytic domain of the glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GH9) and a cellulose-binding module type 3 (CBM3). The enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. EglA has an optimum pH range of 5-8, and remarkable heat stability, retaining more than 85% activity even after a 24-h incubation at pH 6-8.6. This characteristic is an important feature for further applications of this enzyme in biotechnological processes in which temperatures of 50-60 degrees C are required over long incubation periods.
TI  - Purification of a constitutive chitosanase produced by Bacillus sp. MET 1299 with cloning and expression of the gene.
AB  - A chitosanase produced constitutively by Bacillus sp. MET 1299 was purified by SP-Sephadex column chromatography. The molecular weight was estimated to be 52 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Optimal enzyme activity was observed at a pH of 5.5 and temperature of 60 degrees C. The purified chitosanase showed high activity on 90% deacetylated colloidal chitosan and beta-glucan, but not on hydrolyzed colloidal chitin, CMC, or their derivatives. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined. The cloned full length gene, 1362 bp in size, encoded a single peptide of 453 amino acids and had a conserved amino acid sequence of glycosyl hydrolase family 8. A search of the cDNA sequence with NCBI BLAST showed homology with chitosanase of Bacillus sp. KTCC 0377BP and Bacillus sp. No. 7-M. The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified using affinity chromatography and characterized.
TI  - Use of heterotrophic CO2 assimilation as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile bacteria.
AB  - We have examined whether assimilation of CO2 can be used as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile heterotrophic bacteria. CO2 assimilation by environmental samples and pure cultures of heterotrophic bacteria was studied using 14CO2 and 13CO2 as tracers. Heterotrophic growth on complex organic substrates resulted in assimilation of CO2 into cell biomass by activated sludge, drinking water biofilm, and pure cultures of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Es. coli ATCC 13706, Rhodococcus ruber, Burkholderia sp., Bacillus circulans, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Analysis of 13C-labelled phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) confirmed that heterotrophic bacteria may assimilate 13CO2 into cell macromolecules such as membrane lipids. All major PLFAs extracted from activated sludge and drinking water biofilm samples were enriched in 13C after incubation with CO2. Between 1.4% and 6.5% of the biomass produced by cultures of P. putida and a drinking water biofilm during growth in complex media was apparently derived from assimilation of CO2. Resting cells assimilated less CO2 compared to actively growing cells, and CO2 assimilation activity correlated with the amount of biomass produced during heterotrophic growth. The 14CO2 assimilation assay was evaluated as a tool to examine inhibitory effects of biocides on planktonic and sessile heterotrophs (biofilms). On the basis of 14CO2 assimilation activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of benzalkonium chloride was estimated to 21.1 and 127.2 mg l(-1) for planktonic and biofilm samples, respectively. The results indicate that assimilation of isotopically labelled CO2 can be used as a relatively simple measure of metabolic activity in heterotrophic bacteria. CO2 assimilation assays may be used to study the effects of antimicrobial agents on growth and survival of planktonic and sessile heterotrophic organisms.
TI  - Single amino acid mutations interchange the reaction specificities of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase and the acarbose-modifying enzyme acarviosyl transferase.
AB  - Acarviosyl transferase (ATase) from Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 is a bacterial enzyme that transfers the acarviosyl moiety of the diabetic drug acarbose to sugar acceptors. The enzyme exhibits 42% sequence identity with cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases (CGTase), and both enzymes are members of the alpha-amylase family, a large clan of enzymes acting on starch and related compounds. ATase is virtually inactive on starch, however. In contrast, ATase is the only known enzyme to efficiently use acarbose as substrate (2 micromol min(-1) mg(-1)); acarbose is a strong inhibitor of CGTase and of most other alpha-amylase family enzymes. This distinct reaction specificity makes ATase an interesting enzyme to investigate the variation in reaction specificity of alpha-amylase family enzymes. Here we show that a G140H mutation in ATase, introducing the typical His of the conserved sequence region I of the alpha-amylase family, changed ATase into an enzyme with 4-alpha-glucanotransferase activity (3.4 micromol min(-1) mg(-1)). Moreover, this mutation introduced cyclodextrin-forming activity into ATase, converting 2% of starch into cyclodextrins. The opposite experiment, removing this typical His side chain in CGTase (H140A), introduced acarviosyl transferase activity in CGTase (0.25 micromol min(-1) mg(-1)).
TI  - Expression of cyclodextrinase gene from Paenibacillus sp. A11 in Escherichia coli and characterization of the purified cyclodextrinase.
AB  - The expression of the Paenibacillus sp. A11 cyclodextrinase (CDase) gene using the pUC 18 vector in Escherichia coli JM 109 resulted in the formation of an insoluble CDase protein in the cell debris in addition to a soluble CDase protein in the cytoplasm. Unlike the expression in Paenibacillus sp. A11, CDase was primarily observed in cytoplasm. However, by adding 0.5 M sorbitol as an osmolyte, the formation of insoluble CDase was prevented while a three-fold increase in cytoplasmic CDase activity was achieved after a 24 h-induction. The recombinant CDase protein was purified to approximately 14-fold with a 31% recovery to a specific activity of 141 units/mg protein by 40-60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M, and Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B chromatography. It was homogeneous by non-denaturing and SDS-PAGE. The enzyme was a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 80 kDa, as determined by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. It showed the highest activity at pH 7.0 and 40 degrees C. The catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) values for alpha-, beta-, and gamma- CD were 3.0 x 10(5), 8.8 x 10(5), and 5.5 x 10(5) M(-1) min(-1), respectively. The enzyme hydrolyzed CDs and linear maltooligosaccharides to yield maltose and glucose with less amounts of maltotriose and maltotetraose. The rates of hydrolysis for polysaccharides, soluble starch, and pullulan were very low. The cloned CDase was strongly inactivated by N-bromosuccinimide and diethylpyrocarbonate, but activated by dithiothreitol. A comparison of the biochemical properties of the CDases from Paenibacillus sp. A11 and E. coli transformant (pJK 555) indicates that they were almost identical.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Identification of an alkaline-tolerant cyclodextrin-metabolizing bacterium and characterization of its cyclodextrinase gene.
AB  - Bacillus circulans A11, an alkaline-tolerant cyclodextrin-metabolizing bacterium  isolated from South-East Asian soil, was reidentified as Paenibacillus sp. A11 based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison, G + C content and cellular fatty acid composition. Levels of similarity of the 16S rRNA gene between strain A11 and the Paenibacillus species were 90-99%, while similarity with Bacillus circulans was only 86%. The major cellular fatty acid was anteiso-C15:0 which accounted for 59.3% of the total cellular fatty acids and the G+C content was 50.3 mol%. The CDase gene coding for this enzyme was cloned into E. coli. The open reading frame of the CDase gene was 1,959 bp encoding a CDase of 653 amino acid residues. At maximum growth, the specific activity of the recombinant CDase from E. coli was higher than that of Paenibacillus sp. A11. By SDS-PAGE, the translation product of the recombinant gene showed the same mobility as the purified CDase from the original strain. CDase from both Paenibacillus sp. A11 and E. coli produced glucose and maltose as dominant end-products of beta-CD hydrolysis. The ratio of maltose to glucose was 1:2.
TI  - Display of bacterial lipase on the Escherichia coli cell surface by using FadL as an anchoring motif and use of the enzyme in enantioselective biocatalysis.
AB  - We have developed a novel cell surface display system by employing FadL as an anchoring motif, which is an outer membrane protein involved in long-chain fatty acid transport in Escherichia coli. A thermostable Bacillus sp. strain TG43 lipase (44.5 kDa) could be successfully displayed on the cell surface of E. coli in an active form by C-terminal deletion-fusion of lipase at the ninth external loop of FadL. The localization of the truncated FadL-lipase fusion protein on the cell surface was confirmed by confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis. Lipase activity was mainly detected with whole cells, but not with the culture supernatant, suggesting that cell lysis was not a problem. The activity of cell surface-displayed lipase was examined at different temperatures and pHs and was found to be the highest at 50 degrees C and pH 9 to 10. Cell surface-displayed lipase was quite stable, even at 60 and 70 degrees C, and retained over 90% of the full activity after incubation at 50 degrees C for a week. As a potential application, cell surface-displayed lipase was used as a whole-cell catalyst for kinetic resolution of racemic methyl mandelate. In 36 h of reaction, (S)-mandelic acid could be produced with the enantiomeric excess of 99% and the enantiomeric ratio of 292, which are remarkably higher than values obtained with crude lipase or cross-linked lipase crystal. These results suggest that FadL may be a useful anchoring motif for displaying enzymes on the cell surface of E. coli for whole-cell biocatalysis.
TI  - Nagelamides A-H, new dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids from marine sponge Agelas species.
AB  - Eight new dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids, nagelamides A-H (1-8) and a monomeric one, 9,10-dihydrokeramadine (9), have been isolated from the Okinawan marine sponge Agelas sp., and the structures were elucidated from spectroscopic data. Nagelamides A-H (1-8) exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Nagelamide G (7) inhibited protein phosphatase 2A activity.
TI  - Thermostable flavin reductase that couples with dibenzothiophene monooxygenase, from thermophilic Bacillus sp. DSM411: purification, characterization, and gene cloning.
AB  - Flavin reductase is essential for the oxygenases involved in microbial dibenzothiophene (DBT) desulfurization. An enzyme of the thermophilic strain, Bacillus sp. DSM411, was selected to couple with DBT monooxygenase (DszC) from Rhodococcus erythropolis D-1. The flavin reductase was purified to homogeneity from Bacillus sp. DSM411, and the native enzyme was a monomer of M(r) 16 kDa. Although the best substrates were flavin mononucleotide and NADH, the enzyme also used other flavin compounds and acted slightly on nitroaromatic compounds and NADPH. The purified enzyme coupled with DszC and had a ferric reductase activity. Among the flavin reductases so far characterized, the present enzyme is the most thermophilic and thermostable. The gene coded for a protein of 155 amino acids with a calculated mass of 17,325 Da. The enzyme was overproduced in Escherichia coli, and the specific activity in the crude extracts was about 440-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain, Bacillus sp. DSM411.
TI  - Quinazolin-4-one derivatives from Streptomyces isolates.
AB  - From the ethyl acetate extract of the strain Streptomyces sp. isolate GW23/1540,  besides 16 known products, several 1H-quinazolin-4-one derivatives were isolated. (SR)-2-(1-Hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-quinazolin-4-one (4) and (RR)-2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-quinazolin-4-one (5) are new natural products. 2-Methyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one (2) and 1H-quinazoline-2,4-dione (3) are known from other bacteria and plants, respectively. From another Streptomyces sp., GW2/577, 5-methyl-1H-quinazoline-2,4-dione (6) was isolated and the structure proven by comparison with the isomeric 7. The new natural products showed no activity against the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella sorokiniana, and Scenedesmus subspicatus, the fungus Mucor miehei, the yeast Candida albicans, and the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Streptomyces viridochromogenes.
TI  - Mode of action of the microbial metabolite GE23077, a novel potent and selective  inhibitor of bacterial RNA polymerase.
AB  - GE23077, a novel microbial metabolite recently isolated from Actinomadura sp. culture media, is a potent and selective inhibitor of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). It inhibits Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) RNAPs with IC50 values (i.e. the concentration at which the enzyme activity is inhibited by 50%) in the 10(-8) m range, whereas it is not active on E. coli DNA polymerase or on eukaryotic (wheat germ) RNAP II (IC50 values > 10(-4) m in both cases). In spite of its potent activity on purified bacterial RNAPs, GE23077 shows a narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To investigate the molecular basis of this behaviour, the effects of GE23077 on macromolecular biosynthesis were tested in E. coli cells permeabilized under different conditions. The addition of GE23077 to plasmolyzed cells resulted in an immediate and specific inhibition of intracellular RNA biosynthesis, in a dose-response manner, strongly suggesting that cell penetration is the main obstacle for effective antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic. Biochemical studies were also conducted with purified enzymes to obtain further insights into the mode of action of GE23077. Interestingly, the compound displays a behaviour similar to that of rifampicin, an antibiotic structurally unrelated to GE23077: both compounds act at the level of transcription initiation, but not on the sigma subunit and not on the formation of the promoter DNA-RNAP complex. Tests on different rifampicin-resistant E. coli RNAPs did not show any cross-resistance between the two compounds, indicating distinct binding sites on the target enzyme. In conclusion, GE23077 is an interesting new molecule for future mechanistic studies on bacterial RNAP and for its potential in anti-infective drug discovery.
TI  - Fungistatic and bacteriostatic activities of alkamides from Heliopsis longipes roots: affinin and reduced amides.
AB  - This work demonstrates the fungistatic and bacteriostatic activities of affinin,  the main alkamide of Heliopsis longipes (Gray) Blake (Asteraceae) roots and two alkamides obtained by catalytic reduction of affinin: N-isobutyl-2E-decenamide and N-isobutyl-decanamide. The bioactivity was tested against Rhizoctonia solani groups AG3 and AG5, Sclerotium rolfsii, Sclerotium cepivorum, Fusarium sp., Vertcillium sp., phytopathogenic fungi; Phytophthora infestans, a phytopathogenic Chromista; Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a nonphytopathogenic ascomycete; and Escherichia coli, Erwinia carotovora, and Bacillus subtilis, bacteria. Affinin, being the primary component of the lipidic fraction, is expected to be responsible for the fungitoxic activity observed in roots of this plant species. Four of the assayed fungi showed an important sensitivity to the presence of affinin: S. rolfsii, S. cepivorum, P. infestans, and R. solani AG-3 and AG-5, displaying a growth inhibition of 100%. S. cerevisiaeshowed a similar growth inhibition with affinin. None of the alkamides obtained by catalytic reduction of affinin showed a fungitoxic activity. Affinin had a definite negative effect on the growth of E. coli and B. subtilis, but E. carotovora carotovora was not sensitive to the highest dose of affinin assayed. N-Isobutyl-2E-decenamide displayed a higher bacteriostatic activity against E. coli and E. carotovora carotovora. In both cases, this alkamide was more potent than affinin. On the other hand, only N-isobutyl-decanamide displayed a significant activity on the growth of B. subtilis.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and fibrin (ogen)olytic properties of a subtilisin DJ-4 gene from Bacillus sp. DJ-4.
AB  - Previously, we purified a strong fibrinolytic enzyme (subtilisin DJ-4) from Bacillus sp. DJ-4 and characterized its enzymatic activity. Here, we cloned the gene subtilisin DJ-4, and determines its nucleotide sequence, which showed 97% identity with subtilisin BPN' from B. amyloliquefacens. Recombinant full-subtilisin DJ-4 (rf-subDJ-4) and mature-subtilisin DJ-4 (rm-subDJ-4) were expressed using a pET29 vector system, and their fibrin (ogen)olytic and plasminogen activator activities were studied. rf-subDJ-4 was found to have a higher stability to heat (60 degrees C) and to acidic conditions (pH 3.0-4.0) than the native subtilisin DJ-4 of Bacillus sp. DJ-4. The plasminogen activator activity of rf-subDJ-4 was 2.75 times greater than that of plasmin on a molar basis. And its specific activity (F/C, the ratio of fibrinolytic activity to caseinolytic activity) was 2.67 and 3.97 times higher than those of subtilisin BPN' and subtilisin Carlsberg, respectively. rf-subDJ-4 rapidly hydrolyzed the Aalpha-, Bbeta-, and gamma-chains of fibrinogen within 5 min. But, unlike subtilisin BPN' at a very low concentration (50 ng), the gamma-chain was not cleaved. On the other hand, rm-subDJ-4 did not show enzyme activity.
TI  - Fusion of Bacillus stearothermophilus leucine aminopeptidase II with the raw-starch-binding domain of Bacillus sp. strain TS-23 alpha-amylase generates a chimeric enzyme with enhanced thermostability and catalytic activity.
AB  - Bacillus stearothermophilus leucine aminopeptidase II (LAPII) was fused at its C-terminal end with the raw-starch-binding domain of Bacillus sp. strain TS-23 alpha-amylase. The chimeric enzyme (LAPsbd), with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 61 kDa, was overexpressed in IPTG-induced Escherichia coli cells and purified to homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography. The purified enzyme retained LAP activity and adsorbed raw starch. LAPsbd was stable at 70 degrees C for 10 min, while the activity of wild-type enzyme was completely abolished under the same environmental condition. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, the twofold increase in the catalytic efficiency for LAPsbd was due to a 218% increase in the k(cat) value.
TI  - Identification of the Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 cyanophycin synthetase as suitable enzyme for production of cyanophycin in gram-negative bacteria like Pseudomonas putida and Ralstonia eutropha.
AB  - The cyanophycin synthetase gene cphA1 encoding the major cyanophycin synthetase (CphA) of Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 was expressed in Escherichia coli conferring so far the highest specific CphA activity to E. coli (6.7 nmol arginine per min and mg protein). CphA1 and cphA genes of Synechocystis sp. strains PCC6803 and PCC6308 and Synechococcus strain MA19 were also expressed in wild types and polyhydroxyalkanoate-negative (PHA) mutants of Pseudomonas putida and Ralstonia eutropha. Recombinant strains of these bacteria expressing cphA1 accumulated generally more cyanophycin (23.0 and 20.0% of cellular dry matter, CDM, respectively) than recombinants expressing any other cphA (6.8, 9.0, or 15.8% of CDM for P. putida strains and 7.3, 12.6, or 14.1% of CDM for R. eutropha). Furthermore, PHA-negative mutants of P. putida (9.7, 10.0, 17.5, or 24.0% of CDM) and R. eutropha (8.9, 13.8, 16.0, or 22.0% of CDM) accumulated generally more cyanophycin than the corresponding PHA-positive parent strains (6.8, 9.0, 15.8, and 23.0% of CDM for P. putida strains and 7.3, 12.6, 14.1, or 20.0% of CDM for R. eutropha strains). Recombinant strains of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium, Corynebacterium glutamicum) were not suitable for cyanophycin production due to accumulation of less cyanophycin and retarded release of cyanophycin. PHA-negative mutants of P. putida and R. eutropha expressing cphA1 of Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 are therefore preferred candidates for industrial production of cyanophycin.
TI  - Synergistic activity of Paenibacillus sp. BP-23 cellobiohydrolase Cel48C in association with the contiguous endoglucanase Cel9B and with endo- or exo-acting glucanases from Thermobifida fusca.
AB  - Cellobiohydrolase Cel48C from Paenibacillus sp. BP-23, an enzyme displaying limited activity on most cellulosic substrates, was assayed for activity in the presence of other bacterial endo- or exocellulases. Significant enhanced activity was observed when Cel48C was incubated in the presence of Paenibacillus sp. BP-23 endoglucanase Cel9B or Thermobifida fusca cellulases Cel6A and Cel6B, indicating that Cel48C acts synergistically with them. Maximum synergism rates on bacterial microcrystalline cellulose or filter paper were obtained with a mixture of Paenibacillus cellulases Cel9B and Cel48C, accompanied by T. fusca exocellulase Cel6B. Synergism was also observed in cell extracts from recombinant clone E. coli pUCel9-Cel48 expressing the two contiguous Paenibacillus cellulases Cel9B and Cel48C. The enhanced cellulolytic activity displayed by the cellulase mixtures assayed could be used as an efficient tool for biotechnological applications like pulp and paper manufacturing.
TI  - Production of autoproteolytically subunit-assembled 7-beta-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporanic acid (GL-7ACA) acylase from Pseudomonas sp. C427 using a chitin-binding domain.
AB  - 7-Beta-(4-Carboxybutanamido)cephalosporanic acid (GL-7ACA) acylase from Pseudomonas sp. C427 is known as a proteolytically processed bacterial enzyme. GL-7ACA acylase from Pseudomonas sp. C427 (C427) consists of alpha- and beta-subunits that are processed from a precursor peptide by removing the spacer peptide. A chitin-binding domain (CBD) of chitinase A1 derived from Bacillus circulans was genetically fused into four different positions of the C427-encoding gene. In the four enzymes thereby produced, Nalpha427, SP427, Calpha427, and Cbeta427, it was fused, respectively, to the N-terminal region of the alpha-subunit; the C-terminal region of the alpha-subunit; the three-amino-acid upper region of the C-terminal of the alpha-subunit; and to the C-terminal region of the beta-subunit. All of the fusion enzymes, expressed in Eschericha coli, were successfully processed into active forms and had GL-7ACA acylase activity. The affinity-binding activity to crystalline chitin was affected by the fusing position of CBD. Nalpha427, Calpha427, and Cbeta427 remained fused to the CBD after their processing steps and could bind to chitin, but in the case of SP427 the fused CBD was cleaved away during the processing steps and binding activity was no longer observed. These results indicate that CBD is functional in such autoproteolytically subunit-assembled acylases.
TI  - Identification and functional analysis of the genes encoding dibenzothiophene-desulfurizing enzymes from thermophilic bacteria.
AB  - Thermophilic bacteria Bacillus subtilis WU-S2B and Mycobacterium phlei WU-F1 desulfurize dibenzothiophene (DBT) and alkylated DBTs through specific cleavage of the carbon-sulfur bonds over a temperature range up to 52 degrees C. In order to identify and functionally analyze the DBT-desulfurization genes, the gene cluster containing bdsA, bdsB, and bdsC was cloned from B. subtilis WU-S2B. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of bdsABC show homologies to those of the other known DBT-desulfurization genes and enzymes; e.g. a nucleotide sequence homology of 61.0% to dszABC of the mesophilic bacterium Rhodococcus sp. IGTS8 and 57.8% to tdsABC of the thermophilic bacterium Paenibacillus sp. A11-2. Deletion and subcloning analysis of bdsABC revealed that the gene products of bdsC, bdsA and bdsB oxidized DBT to DBT sulfone (DBTO(2)), converted DBTO(2) to 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate (HBPSi), and desulfurized HBPSi to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP), respectively. Resting cells of a recombinant Escherichia coli JM109 harboring bdsABC converted DBT to 2-HBP over a temperature range of 30-52 degrees C, indicating that the gene products of bdsABC were functional in the recombinant. The activities of DBT degradation at 50 degrees C and DBT desulfurization (2-HBP production) at 40 degrees C in resting cells of the recombinant were approximately five times and twice, respectively, as high as those in B. subtilis WU-S2B. The recombinant E. coli cells also degraded alkylated DBTs, such as 2,8-dimethylDBT and 4,6-dimethylDBT. The nucleotide sequences of B. subtilis WU-S2B bdsABC and the corresponding genes from M. phlei WU-F1 were found to be completely identical to each other although the strains are genetically different.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of Bacillus subtilis type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, and phylogenetic distribution of isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways.
AB  - An open reading frame (Acc. no. P50740) on the Bacillus subtilis chromosome extending from bp 184,997-186,043 with similarity to the idi-2 gene of Streptomyces sp. CL190 specifying type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase was expressed in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain. The recombinant protein with a subunit mass of 39 kDa was purified to apparent homogeneity by column chromatography. The protein was shown to catalyse the conversion of dimethylallyl diphosphate into isopentenyl diphosphate and vice versa at rates of 0.23 and 0.63 micromol.mg(-1).min(-1), respectively, as diagnosed by 1H spectroscopy. FMN and divalent cations are required for catalytic activity; the highest rates were found with Ca2+. NADPH is required under aerobic but not under anaerobic assay conditions. The enzyme is related to a widespread family of (S)-alpha-hydroxyacid oxidizing enzymes including flavocytochrome b2 and L-lactate dehydrogenase and was shown to catalyse the formation of [2,3-13C2]lactate from [2,3-13C2]pyruvate, albeit at a low rate of 1 nmol.mg(-1).min(-1). Putative genes specifying type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerases were found in the genomes of Archaea and of certain eubacteria but not in the genomes of fungi, animals and plants. The analysis of the occurrence of idi-1 and idi-2 genes in conjunction with the mevalonate and nonmevalonate pathway in 283 completed and unfinished prokaryotic genomes revealed 10 different classes. Type II isomerase is essential in some important human pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis where it may represent a novel target for anti-infective therapy.
TI  - Significance of codon usage and irregularities of rare codon distribution in genes for expression of BspLU11III methyltransferases.
AB  - Genes of adenine-specific DNA-methyltransferase M.BspLU11IIIa and cytosine-specific DNA-methyltransferase M.BspLU11IIIb of the type IIG BspLU11III restriction-modification system from the thermophilic strain Bacillus sp. LU11 were expressed in E. coli. They contain a large number of codons that are rare in E. coli and are characterized by equal values of codon adaptation index (CAI) and expression level measure (E(g)). Rare codons are either diffused (M.BspLU11IIIa) or located in clusters (M.BspLU11IIIb). The expression level of the cytosine-specific DNA-methyltransferase was increased by a factor of 7.3 and that of adenine-specific DNA only by a factor of 1.25 after introduction of the plasmid pRARE supplying tRNA genes for six rare codons in E. coli. It can be assumed that the plasmid supplying minor tRNAs can strongly increase the expression level of only genes with cluster distribution of rare codons. Using heparin-Sepharose and phosphocellulose chromatography and gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 both DNA-methyltransferases were isolated as electrophoretically homogeneous proteins (according to the results of SDS-PAGE).
TI  - Cytoplasmic membrane polarization in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria grown in the absence and presence of tetracycline.
AB  - The ability of numerous diverse compounds and ions to cross the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by diffusion and active transport is highly dependent on cytoplasmic membrane fluidity, which can be measured using fluorescent probes to estimate membrane polarization values. However, membrane polarization data are lacking for most bacterial species. The cytoplasmic membrane polarization values for Arthrobacter sp. ATCC 21908, Bacillus cereus NRC 3045, Pseudomonas fluorescens R2F, Pseudomonas putida NRC 2986 and Escherichia coli C600 bacterial cells were spectrofluorometrically measured over a temperature range from 10 to 50 degrees C, and in the absence and presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline, using the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) to obtain new information on their membrane fluidity. At an assay temperature of 10 degrees C, E. coli cells grown in the absence of tetracycline exhibited the highest cytoplasmic membrane polarization value (least fluid membrane) of 0.446, followed by values of 0.392, 0.371, 0.344 and 0.293, respectively, for B. cereus, Arthrobacter sp., P. fluorescens and P. putida. At an assay temperature of 30 degrees C, the polarization values ranged from 0.357 to 0.288 for cells grown in the absence of tetracycline, regardless of the species. B. cereus grown in the presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline had lower polarization values than when grown in the absence of this antibiotic at all assay temperatures. Regardless of the absence or presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline in the growth medium, all bacterial species generally exhibited a more fluid membrane as the assay temperature increased from 10 to 50 degrees C. To our knowledge, these are some of the first cytoplasmic membrane polarization values reported for these Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria over a broad temperature range and also for cells grown in the presence of tetracycline.
TI  - Synthesis, absolute stereochemistry and molecular design of the new antifungal and antibacterial antibiotic produced by Streptomyces sp.201.
AB  - The absolute stereochemistry of the new antifungal and antibacterial antibiotic produced by Streptomyces sp.201 has been established by achieving the total synthesis of the product. A series of analogues have also been synthesized by changing the side chain and their bioactivity assessed against different microbial strains. Among them, 1e (R = C8H17) was found to be the most potent with MIC of 8 microg/mL against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 12 microg/mL against Escherichia coli and 16 microg/mL against Bacillus subtilis 6 microg/mL against Proteus vulgaris. This was followed by 1b (R = C5H11) with MIC of 10-20 microg/mL range and 1d (R = C7H15) with MIC of 14-24 g/mL, whereas 1a (R = C4H9) and 1f (R = C18H35) were found to be completely inactive. Besides, 1c (R = C6H13) showed certain extent of antibacterial activity in the range of 24-50 microg/mL. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was very sensitive to 1e (R = C8H17) with MIC of 8 microg/mL. Antifungal activity of analogues 1d (R = C7H15) and 1e, (R = C8H17) against Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani were found promising with MFCs in the 15-18 microg/mL range.
TI  - Overexpression, purification, and characterization of ATP-NAD kinase of Sphingomonas sp. A1.
AB  - The NAD kinase gene (nadK) of Sphingomonas sp. A1 was cloned and then overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the gene product (NadK) was purified from the E. coli cells through five steps with a 25% yield of activity. NadK was a homodimer of 32 kDa subunits, utilized ATP or other nucleoside triphosphates, but not inorganic polyphosphates, as phosphoryl donors for the phosphorylation of NAD, most efficiently at pH 8.0 and 50-55 degrees C, and was designated as ATP-NAD kinase (NadK). NadK showed no NADH kinase activity and was slightly inhibited by NADP(H). Precursors for NAD biosynthesis such as quinolinic acid, nicotinic acid mononucleotide, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, and nicotinic acid had no effect on the NadK activity, as observed in the cases of the NAD kinases of Micrococcus flavus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and E. coli. Taken together with the report that the NAD kinase of Bacillus subtilis is activated by quinolinic acid [J. Bacteriol. 185 (2003) 4844], it is indicated that the regulatory patterns of NAD kinases differ even among bacterial NAD kinases.
TI  - Heterologous gene expression in Thermus thermophilus: beta-galactosidase, dibenzothiophene monooxygenase, PNB carboxy esterase, 2-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol dioxygenase, and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase.
AB  - Enzymes from thermophiles are preferred for industrial applications because they  generally show improved tolerance to temperature, pressure, solvents, and pH as compared with enzymes from mesophiles. However, nearly all thermostable enzymes used in industrial applications or available commercially are produced as recombinant enzymes in mesophiles, typically Escherichia coli. The development of high-temperature bioprocesses, particularly those involving cofactor-requiring enzymes and/or multi-step enzymatic pathways, requires a thermophilic host. The extreme thermophile most amenable to genetic manipulation is Thermus thermophilus, but the study of expression of heterologous genes in T. thermophilus is in its infancy. While several heterologous genes have previously been expressed in T. thermophilus, the data reported here include the first examples of the functional expression of a gene from an archaeal hyperthermophile ( bglA from Pyrococcus woesei), a cofactor-requiring enzyme ( dszC from Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8), and a two-component enzyme ( carBa and carBb from Sphingomonas sp. GTIN11). A thermostable derivative of pnbA from Bacillus subtilis was also expressed, further expanding the list of genes from heterologous hosts that have been expressed in T. thermophilus.
TI  - Identification of the first archaeal Type 1 RNase H gene from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1: archaeal RNase HI can cleave an RNA-DNA junction.
AB  - All the archaeal genomes sequenced to date contain a single Type 2 RNase H gene.  We found that the genome of a halophilic archaeon, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, contains an open reading frame with similarity to Type 1 RNase H. The protein encoded by the Vng0255c gene, possessed amino acid sequence identities of 33% with Escherichia coli RNase HI and 34% with a Bacillus subtilis RNase HI homologue. The B. subtilis RNase HI homologue, however, lacks amino acid sequences corresponding to a basic protrusion region of the E. coli RNase HI, and the Vng0255c has the similar deletion. As this deletion apparently conferred a complete loss of RNase H activity on the B. subtilis RNase HI homologue protein, the Vng0255c product was expected to exhibit no RNase H activity. However, the purified recombinant Vng0255c protein specifically cleaved an RNA strand of the RNA/DNA hybrid in vitro, and when the Vng0255c gene was expressed in an E. coli strain MIC2067 it could suppress the temperature-sensitive growth defect associated with the loss of RNase H enzymes of this strain. These results in vitro and in vivo strongly indicate that the Halobacterium Vng0255c is the first archaeal Type 1 RNase H. This enzyme, unlike other Type 1 RNases H, was able to cleave an Okazaki fragment-like substrate at the junction between the 3'-side of ribonucleotide and 5'-side of deoxyribonucleotide. It is likely that the archaeal Type 1 RNase H plays a role in the removal of the last ribonucleotide of the RNA primer from the Okazaki fragment during DNA replication.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - New sesterterpenes from the Antarctic sponge Suberites sp.
AB  - Suberitenones C and D and suberiphenol, three new sesterterpenes of the suberitane class, were isolated from the sponge Suberites sp. collected from Antarctica. The structures of these compounds were determined on the basis of combined spectral and chemical analyses.
TI  - Improvement of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase as an antistaling enzyme by error-prone PCR.
AB  - In an effort to improve the properties of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) as an antistaling enzyme, error-prone PCR was used to introduce random mutations into a CGTase cloned from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. I-5 (CGTase I-5). A mutant CGTase[3-18] with the three mutations M234T, F259I and V591A was selected by agar plate assay. Sequence alignment of various CGTases indicated that M234 and F259 are located in the vicinity of the catalytic sites of the enzyme and V591 in the starch binding domain E. The cyclization activity of CGTase[3-18] was dramatically decreased by 10-fold, while the hydrolyzing activity was increased by up to 15-fold. These mutations near subsite +1 (M234T) and at subsite +2 (F259I) are likely to alter the enzyme activity in a concerted manner, promoting hydrolysis of substrate while retarding cyclization. The addition of CGTase[3-18] reduced the retrogradation rate of bread by as much as did the commercial antistaling enzyme Novamyl during 7-day storage at 4 degrees C. No cyclodextrin (CD) was detected in bread treated with CGTase[3-18], whereas 21 mg of CD per 10 g of bread was produced in bread treated with wild-type CGTase.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of xylanase A from the strain Bacillus sp. BP-7: comparison with alkaline pI-low molecular weight xylanases of family 11.
AB  - The xynA gene encoding a xylanase from the recently isolated Bacillus sp. strain  BP-7 has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant xylanase A showed high activity on xylans from hardwoods and cereals, and exhibited maximum activity at pH 6 and 60 degrees C. The enzyme remained stable after incubation at 50 degrees C and pH 7 for 3 h, and it was strongly inhibited by Mn(2+), Fe(3+), Pb(2+), and Hg(2+). Analysis of xylanase A in zymograms showed an apparent molecular size of 24 kDa and a pI of above 9. The amino acid sequence of xylanase A, as deduced from xynA gene, shows homology to alkaline pI-low molecular weight xylanases of family 11 such as XynA from Bacillus subtilis. Analysis of codon usage in xynA from Bacillus sp. BP-7 shows that the G+C content at the first and second codon positions is notably different from the mean values found for glycosyl hydrolase genes from Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - A global approach to identify novel broad-spectrum antibacterial targets among proteins of unknown function.
AB  - Attempted allelic replacement of 144 Streptococcus pneumoniae open reading frames of previously uncharacterized function led to the identification of 36 genes essential for growth under laboratory conditions. Of these, 14 genes (obg, spoIIIJ2, trmU, yacA, yacM, ydiC, ydiE, yjbN, yneS, yphC, ysxC, ytaG, yloI and yxeH4) were also essential in Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae or Escherichia coli, 2 genes (yrrK and ydiB) were only essential in H. influenzae as well as S. pneumoniae and 8 genes were necessary for growth of S.pneumoniae and S. aureus and did not have a homolog in H. influenzae(murD2, ykqC, ylqF, yqeH, ytgP, yybQ) or were not essential in that organism (yqeL, yhcT). The proteins encoded by these genes could represent good targets for novel antibiotics covering different therapeutic profiles. The putative functions of some of these essential proteins, inferred by bioinformatic analysis, are presented. Four mutants, with deletions of loci not essential for in vitro growth, were found to be severely attenuated in a murine respiratory tract infection model, suggesting that not all targets for antibacterial therapeutics are revealed by simple in vitro essentiality testing. The results of our experiments together with those collated from previously reported studies including Bacillus subtilis, E. coli and Mycoplasma sp. demonstrate that gene conservation amongst bacteria does not necessarily indicate that essentiality in one organism can be extrapolated to others. Moreover, this study demonstrates that different experimental procedures can produce apparently contradictory results.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activity of Syzygium jambolanum seeds.
AB  - The water and methanolic extracts of Syzygium jambolanum seeds were examined for  antibacterial and antifungal activity in vitro using the disc diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration. Activity against gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus), gram negative bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) and fungal strains (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus sp., Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Microsporum gypseum) is discussed.
TI  - Interactions between penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and two novel classes of  PBP inhibitors, arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones.
AB  - Several non-beta-lactam compounds were active against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The MICs of arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones were lower than those of ampicillin and cefotaxime for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MI339 and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium EF12. Several compounds were found to inhibit the cell wall synthesis of S. aureus and the last two steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis catalyzed by ether-treated cells of Escherichia coli or cell wall membrane preparations of Bacillus megaterium. The effects of the arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-one derivatives on E. coli PBP 3 and PBP 5, Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP 2xS (PBP 2x from a penicillin-sensitive strain) and PBP 2xR (PBP 2x from a penicillin-resistant strain), low-affinity PBP 2a of S. aureus, and the Actinomadura sp. strain R39 and Streptomyces sp. strain R61 DD-peptidases were studied. Some of the compounds exhibited inhibitory activities in the 10 to 100 microM concentration range. The inhibition of PBP 2xS by several of them appeared to be noncompetitive. The dissociation constant for the best inhibitor (Ki = 10 microM) was not influenced by the presence of the substrate.
TI  - Cloning and analysis of WF146 protease, a novel thermophilic subtilisin-like protease with four inserted surface loops.
AB  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding WF146 protease, an extracellular subtilisin-like protease from the thermophile Bacillus sp. WF146, revealed that the WF146 protease was translated as a 416-amino acid precursor consisting of a putative 18-amino acid signal peptide, a 10-kDa N-terminal propeptide and a 32-kDa mature protease region. The mature WF146 protease shares a high degree of amino acid sequence identity with two psychrophilic subtilisins, S41 (68.2%) and S39 (65.4%), and a mesophilic subtilisin, SSII (67.1%). Significantly, these closely related proteases adapted to different temperatures all had four inserted surface loops not found in other subtilisins. However, unlike those of S41, S39 and SSII, the inserted loops of the WF146 protease possessed stabilizing features, such as the introduction of Pro residues into the loop regions. Interestingly, the WF146 protease contained five of the seven mutations previously found in a hyperstable variant of subtilisin S41 obtained by directed evolution. The proform of WF146 protease (pro-WF146 protease) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli in an inactive soluble form. After heat treatment, the 42-kDa pro-WF146 protease converted to a 32-kDa active mature form by processing the N-terminal propeptide. The purified mature WF146 protease hydrolyzed casein with an optimum temperature of 85 degrees C, and lost activity with a half-life of 30 min at 80 degrees C in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2.
TI  - Posttranslational processing of polysaccharide lyase: maturation route for gellan lyase in Bacillus sp. GL1.
AB  - Cells of Bacillus sp. GL1 extracellularly secrete a gellan lyase with a molecular mass of 130 kDa responsible for the depolymerization of a heteropolysaccharide (gellan), although the gene is capable of encoding a huge protein with a molecular mass of 263 kDa. A maturation route for gellan lyase in the bacterium was determined using anti-gellan lyase antibodies. The fluid of the bacterial exponentially growing cultures on gellan contained two proteins with molecular masses of 260 and 130 kDa, both of which reacted with the antibodies. The 260 kDa protein was purified from the cultured fluid and characterized. The protein exhibited gellan lyase activity and showed similar enzyme properties, such as optimal pH and temperature, thermal stability, and substrate specificity, to those of the 130 kDa gellan lyase. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the 260 and 130 kDa enzymes were found to be identical. Determination of the C-terminal amino acid of the 130 kDa enzyme indicated that the 260 kDa enzyme is cleaved between the 1205Gly and 1206Leu residues to yield the mature form (130 kDa) of the gellan lyase. Therefore, the mature enzyme consists of 1170 amino acids (36Ala-1205Gly) with a molecular weight of 125,345, which is in good agreement with that calculated from SDS-PAGE analysis. Judging from these results, gellan lyase is first synthesized as a preproform (263 kDa) and then secreted as a precursor (260 kDa) into the medium through cleavage of the signal peptide. Finally, the precursor is post-translationally processed into the N-terminal half domain of 130 kDa as the mature form, the function of C-terminal half domain being unclear.
TI  - Thermobaculum terrenum gen. nov., sp. nov.: a non-phototrophic gram-positive thermophile representing an environmental clone group related to the Chloroflexi (green non-sulfur bacteria) and Thermomicrobia.
AB  - A novel bacterium was cultivated from an extreme thermal soil in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, that at the time of sampling had a pH of 3.9 and a temperature range of 65-92 degrees C. This organism was found to be an obligate aerobic, non-spore-forming rod, and formed pink-colored colonies. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed this organism in a clade composed entirely of environmental clones most closely related to the phyla Chloroflexi and Thermomicrobia. This bacterium stained gram-positive, contained a novel fatty-acid profile, had cell wall muramic acid content similar to that of Bacillus subtilis (significantly greater than Escherichia coli), and failed to display a lipopolysaccharide profile in SDS-polyacrylamide gels that would be indicative of a gram-negative cell wall structure. Ultrastructure examinations with transmission electron microscopy showed a thick cell wall (approximately 34 nm wide) external to a cytoplasmic membrane. The organism was not motile under the culture conditions used, and electron microscopic examination showed no evidence of flagella. Genomic G+C content was 56.4 mol%, and growth was optimal at 67 degrees C and at a pH of 7.0. This organism was able to grow heterotrophically on various carbon compounds, would use only oxygen as an electron acceptor, and its growth was not affected by light. A new species of a novel genus is proposed, with YNP1(T) (T=type strain) being Thermobaculum terrenum gen. nov., sp. nov. (16S rDNA gene GenBank accession AF391972). This bacterium has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC BAA-798) and the University of Oregon Culture Collection of Microorganisms from Extreme Environments (CCMEE 7001).
TI  - Bacillus subtilis ypgA gene is fni, a nonessential gene encoding type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase.
AB  - We previously identified the fni gene of Streptomyces sp. strain CL190 as type 2  isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) isomerase, which needs both FMN and NADPH for enzyme activity. An fni gene homolog, ypgA, was detected in the database of the Bacillus subtilis genome. However, the ypgA product was about 140 amino acids shorter in the N-terminal than the Streptomyces fni gene product. A database search found three new putative start codons in 129, 225, and 411 bases upstream of the original start codon of the ypgA gene. The longest gene product, which was named ypgA3, showed the most significant homology to the Streptomyces fni gene product. The ypgA3 gene was expressed with an N-terminal His-tag in Escherichia coli and the purified soluble protein was characterized in detail. The ypgA3 protein converted IPP to its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate in the presence of both FMN and NADPH. The enzyme also catalyzed the reverse reaction in the presence of both the cofactors. Disruption of the ypgA3 gene was not lethal to B. subtilis. These results indicate that Bacillus ypgA3 gene is fni, a nonessential gene encoding type 2 IPP isomerase.
TI  - Specificity and enzyme kinetics of the quorum-quenching N-Acyl homoserine lactone lactonase (AHL-lactonase).
AB  - N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing signals are the vital elements of  bacterial quorum-sensing systems, which regulate diverse biological functions, including virulence. The AHL-lactonase, a quorumquenching enzyme encoded by aiiA from Bacillus sp., inactivates AHLs by hydrolyzing the lactone bond to produce corresponding N-acyl homoserines. To characterize the enzyme, the recombinant AHL-lactonase and its four variants were purified. Kinetic and substrate specificity analysis showed that AHL-lactonase had no or little residue activity to non-acyl lactones and noncyclic esters, but displayed strong enzyme activity toward all tested AHLs, varying in length and nature of the substitution at the C3 position of the acyl chain. The data also indicate that the amide group and the ketone at the C1 position of the acyl chain of AHLs could be important structural features in enzyme-substrate interaction. Surprisingly, although carrying a (104)HX- HXDH(109) short sequence identical to the zinc-binding motif of several groups of metallohydrolytic enzymes, AHL-lactonase does not contain or require zinc or other metal ions for enzyme activity. Except for the amino acid residue His-104, which was shown previously to not be required for catalysis, kinetic study and conformational analysis using circular dichroism spectrometry showed that substitution of the other key residues in the motif (His-106, Asp-108, and His-109), as well as His-169 with serine, respectively, caused conformational changes and significant loss of enzyme activity. We conclude that AHL-lactonase is a highly specific enzyme and that the (106)HXDH(109) approximately H(169) of AHL-lactonase represents a novel catalytic motif, which does not rely on zinc or other metal ions for activity.
TI  - Identification of bacilysin, chlorotetaine, and iturin a produced by Bacillus sp. strain CS93 isolated from pozol, a Mexican fermented maize dough.
AB  - Three antimicrobial compounds produced by Bacillus sp. strain CS93 isolated from  pozol were identified by using high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The three compounds were iturin, bacilysin, and chlorotetaine. Production of these compounds by CS93 could account for the medicinal properties attributed to pozol.
TI  - Relationships among ecology, demography and diseases of European bison (Bison bonasus).
AB  - The bison population in the Bialowieza Forest in Poland has now grown to approximately 300, while the herds in the Belarusian part of the forest total about 240 bison. The first signs of a health problem in these herds appeared in 1980, when two cases of balanoposthitis were detected in two bulls (2 and 5 years of age). Since 1980 research has been conducted to explain the cause of diseases, particularly balanoposthitis, and to monitor the health of bison in Bialowieza Forest. A total number of 614 bison (294 male and 320 female) of different ages was eliminated between 1980 and 2000. Not all the culled bison were examined (postmortem analysis, histopathological, bacteriological, virological and toxicological examinations, serological tests, molecular research). Based on the increase in numbers, reproduction in this population for the past 21 years is generally considered successful. Among 182 male bison eliminated during 1990-2000, only 85, or 47%, of the animals had balanoposthitis. Thus, the percentage of balanoposthitis cases went from 100% during the 1980s down to 47% in the past decade. It appears that the culling process has been a major factor leading to this decrease. It can be assumed that a set of factors is involved in the appearance of the disease (Corynebacterium spp., Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Ureoplasma spp, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptoccocus spp., Staphyloccocus spp.) while opportunistic infections including nematodes (Onchocerca spp.) are responsible for the occurrence of secondary lesions.
TI  - Reconfirmation of antimicrobial activity in the coelomic fluid of the earthworm Eisenia fetida andrei by colorimetric assay.
AB  - A novel tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tet razolium (MTS) was used in the assessment of antimicrobial activity in earthworm in the presence of phenazine methosulphate (PMS) as an electron coupling reagent. This activity was purified from the coelomic fluid of the earthworm (ECF), Eisenia fetida andrei (Oligochaeta, Lumbricidae, annelids) using a series of column chromatography techniques and was tested against three Gram-negative strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and three Gram-positive strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus megaterium, Arthrobacter sp., respectively. Only the pigment-free eluate of coelomic fluid of the earthworm (ECFPE) showed activity against B. megaterium amongst three isolated active fractions. The anion (DEAE-52) exchange effluent of the ECFPE was reported to have the strongest activity against P. aeruginosa amongst the three active fractions. The 20% acetonitrile eluate (AE) by Sep-Pak C18 cartridge was also tested and showed fair resistance against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and Arthrobacter sp., respectively.
TI  - LexA-binding sequences in Gram-positive and cyanobacteria are closely related.
AB  - The lexA gene of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 has been cloned by PCR amplification with primers designed after TBLASTN analysis of its genome sequence using the Escherichia coli LexA sequence as a probe. After over-expression in E. coli and subsequent purification, footprinting experiments demonstrated that the Anabaena LexA protein binds to the sequence TAGTACTAATGTTCTA, which is found upstream of its own coding gene. Directed mutagenesis and sequence comparison of promoters of other Anabaena genes, as well as those of several cyanobacteria, allowed us to define the motif RGTACNNNDGTWCB as the LexA box in this bacterial phylum. Substitution of a single nucleotide in this motif present in the Anabena lexA promoter is sufficient to enable it to bind the Bacillus subtilis LexA protein. These data indicate that Cyanobacteria and Gram-positive bacteria are phylogenetically closely related.
TI  - Expression and secretion of an alpha-amylase gene from a native strain of Bacillus licheniformis in Escherichia coli by T7 promoter and putative signal peptide of the gene.
AB  - The gene encoding a hyperthermostable alpha-amylase from a Bacillus licheniformis native strain was cloned in pET24d transcription vector containing T7 promoter, and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Having confirmed the alpha-amylase activity through activity staining method on SDS-PAGE gel, the yields of production were determined in two separated intra and inter-cellular phases and compared using enzymatic assay methods. Extracellular production of the active recombinant enzyme implies the recognition of the putative signal peptide of this Bacillus sp. by E. coli secretory system. This may be because of the amino acid sequence of this signal peptide which covers all the structural parameters of a standard signal peptide processed by Lep B, the major signal peptidase in E. coli secretory system. This study recommends the use of this signal peptide for extracellular production of other foreign proteins in E. coli.
TI  - Production of soluble and functional engineered antibodies in Escherichia coli improved by FkpA.
AB  - Overproduction of genetically engineered antibodies, such as single-chain antibodies (scAbs) in Escherichia coli often results in insoluble and inactive products known as inclusion bodies. We now report that fusion or co-expression of FkpA, the E. coli periplasmic peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase with chaperone activity, substantially improves soluble and functional expression of scAbs. Anti-human bladder carcinoma scAb (PG) and anti-human CD3 x anti-human ovarian carcinoma-bispecific scAb (BH1) were fused with FkpA on the pTMF-based plasmid and expressed in E. coli. More than half of the amount of each expressed fusion protein FkpA-PG or FkpA-BH1 was soluble. In addition, the fusion protein cellulose-binding domain from Cellulomonas fimi (CBD)-PG and anti-human CD3 x anti-human CD28 x anti-human ovarian carcinoma-trispecific scAb (TRI) fused to the pelB (a signal peptide from pectate lysase B of a Bacillus sp.) signal sequence were co-expressed with FkpA under the control of the T7 promoter. A substantial portion of the co-expressed CBD-PG or TRI was soluble. Furthermore, PG, BH1, and TRI were biologically active as judged by ELISA and in vitro cytotoxicity assay. These results suggest that overexpression of FkpA should be useful in expressing heterologous proteins in E. coli.
TI  - Stable positional cloning of long continuous DNA in the Bacillus subtilis genome  vector.
AB  - Direct cloning of a long continuous genome segment in a Bacillus subtilis genome  vector was demonstrated for the first time. Two small DNA fragments had to be installed in the vector prior to cloning. The DNA between these two fragments was cloned via homologous recombination. The efficiency of cloning was estimated using the 3,573-kb genome of a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Recombinants were selected using the internal selection system of the Bacillus genome vector or with the antibiotic resistance marker in the cyanobacterial genome. Designated genomic segments as large as 77-kb were cloned by means of a single procedure. Cloning efficiency is affected by the molecular weight of the donor DNA and the size of the DNA to be cloned. The method is suitable for direct target cloning of large-sized DNA.
TI  - Expression, isolation, purification, and biochemical properties of trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase from thermoresistant strain Bacillus sp. GP16.
AB  - Here we describe cloning, expression, and purification of the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase from thermoresistant strain Bacillus sp. GP16. Principal biochemical properties of the enzyme at different pH and temperature values were determined. Entropy and enthalpy of activation of the enzyme for substrates trehalose-6-phosphate and p-nitrophenyl glucoside were calculated, and the dependence of the kinetic parameters from ionic strength was established.
TI  - A gene cluster responsible for alkylaldoxime metabolism coexisting with nitrile hydratase and amidase in Rhodococcus globerulus A-4.
AB  - An enzyme "alkylaldoxime dehydratase (OxdRG)" was purified and characterized from Rhodococcus globerulus A-4, in which nitrile hydratase (NHase) and amidase coexisted with the enzyme. The enzyme contains heme b as a prosthetic group, requires reducing reagents for the reaction, and is most active at a neutral pH and at around 30 degrees C, similar to the phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase from Bacillus sp. OxB-1 (OxdB). However, some differences were seen in subunit structure, substrate specificity, and effects of activators and inhibitors. The corresponding gene, oxd, encoding a 1059-base pair ORF consisting of 353 codons, was cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The predicted polypeptide showed 30.3% identity to OxdB. The gene is mapped just upstream of the gene cluster encoding the enzymes involved in the metabolism of aliphatic nitriles, i.e., NHase and amidase, and their regulatory and activator proteins. We report here the existence of an aldoxime dehydratase genetically linked with NHase and amidase, and responsible for the metabolism of alkylaldoxime in R. globerulus.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Bacillus sp. BP-6 LipA, a ubiquitous lipase among mesophilic Bacillus species.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to perform the isolation, cloning and characterization of a lipase from Bacillus sp. BP-6 bearing the features of a biotechnologically important group of enzymes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strain Bacillus sp. BP-6, showing activity on tributyrin plates, was used for isolation of lipase-coding gene lipA by means of inverse and direct PCR. The complete 633 nucleotide ORF isolated was cloned in Escherichia coli for further characterization. The amino acid sequence of the cloned protein was 98% identical to B. subtilis and B. megaterium lipases, the enzyme also showing similar molecular and biochemical features. CONCLUSIONS: The gene coding for Bacillus sp. BP-6 LipA was found in all mesophilic Bacillus species assayed, indicating its ubiquity in the genus. The cloned enzyme displayed the same properties as those of homologous lipases. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The overall profile of Bacillus sp. BP-6 LipA was found to be that of a ubiquitous and highly conserved subfamily I.4 bacterial lipase. Previously described lipases within this family have shown to be well suited for biotechnological applications, suggesting that the cloned enzyme could be used accordingly.
TI  - A novel chitosanase from Bacillus sp. strain K17: gene cloning and expression in  Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene encoding a novel chitosanase from Bacillus sp. strain K17 was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the gene contained an open reading frame corresponded to a protein of 453 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the K17 chitosanase exhibited the highest homology to those of family 8 glycanases, suggesting that the enzyme belonged to family 8.
TI  - Structure of MrsD, an FAD-binding protein of the HFCD family.
AB  - MrsD from Bacillus sp. HIL-Y85/54728 is a member of the HFCD (homo-oligomeric flavin-containing Cys decarboxylases) family of flavoproteins and is involved in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic mersacidin. It catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of the C-terminal cysteine residue of the MrsA precursor peptide of mersacidin, yielding a (Z)-enethiol intermediate as the first step in the formation of the unusual amino acid S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-methyl-D-cysteine. Surprisingly, MrsD was found to bind FAD, in contrast to the three other characterized members of the HFCD family, which bind FMN. To determine the molecular discriminators of FAD binding within the HFCD family, the crystal structure of MrsD was analyzed at a resolution of 2.54 A. Crystals of space group F432 contain one MrsD monomer in the asymmetric unit. However, a Patterson search with EpiD-derived models failed. Based on the consideration that the dodecameric MrsD particle of tetrahedral symmetry resembles the quaternary structure of EpiD, rotational and translational parameters were derived from the geometric consideration that the MrsD dodecamer is generated from a monomer by crystallographic symmetry around the position (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) of the unit cell. A structural comparison with the FMN-binding members of the HFCD family EpiD and AtHAL3a shows conserved sequence motifs in contact with the flavin's pyrimidine ring but divergent environments for the dimethylbenzene ring of the isoalloxazine moiety. The position of the ribityl chain differs in MrsD from that found in EpiD and AtHAL3a. However, the FMN-phosphate binding sites are also highly conserved in their exact positions. In all three cases, the flavin cofactor is bound to a structurally conserved region of the Rossmann-fold monomer, exposing its Re side for catalysis. The adenosyl phosphate of FAD is anchored in a well defined binding site and the adenosine moieties are oriented towards the interior of the hollow particle, where three of them pack against each other around the threefold axis of a trimeric facet.
TI  - Identification of essential histidine residues in a recombinant alpha-amylase of  thermophilic and alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain TS-23.
AB  - To understand the structure-function relationships of a truncated Bacillus sp. strain TS-23 alpha-amylase, each of His-137, His-191, His-239, His-269, His-305, His-323, His-361, His-436, and His-475 was replaced with leucine. The molecular masses of the purified wild-type and mutant enzymes were approximately 54 kDa. The specific activity of His323Leu and His436Leu was decreased by more than 52%, while His239Leu, His305Leu, and His475Leu showed activity similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. As compared with the wild-type enzyme, His323Leu and His436Leu exhibited a 62% decrease in the value of k(cat)/ K(m). Alterations in His-191, His-239, His-305, and His-475 did not cause a significant change in the K(m) or k(cat) values. At 70 degrees C, a decreased half-life was observed in His436Leu. These results indicate that His-137, His-269, and His-361 of Bacillus sp. strain TS-23 alpha-amylase are important for proper catalytic activity and that His-436 may contribute to the thermostability of the enzyme.
TI  - Molecular identification of an alpha-L-rhamnosidase from Bacillus sp strain GL1 as an enzyme involved in complete metabolism of gellan.
AB  - The genes (rhaA and rhaB) for two alpha-L-rhamnosidases of Bacillus sp. strain GL1, which assimilates a bacterial polysaccharide (gellan), were cloned from a genomic DNA library of the bacterium constructed in Escherichia coli, and the nucleotide sequences of the genes were determined. Gene rhaA (2661 bp) contained an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein (RhaA: 886 amino acids) with a molecular weight (MW) of 98280. Gene rhaB (2871 bp) contained an ORF encoding a protein (RhaB: 956 amino acids) with a MW of 106049. RhaA exhibited significant identity (41%) with alpha-L-rhamnosidase of Clostridium stercorarium, while RhaB showed slight homology with enzymes from other sources. An overexpression system for the two enzymes was constructed in E. coli, and the enzymes were purified and characterized. Both RhaA and RhaB were highly specific for rhamnosyl saccharides, including gellan disaccharide (rhamnosyl glucose) and naringin, and released rhamnose from substrates most efficiently at pH 6.5-7.0 and 40 degrees C. Bacillus sp. strain GL1 cells grown in a gellan medium produced only RhaB, indicating that RhaB plays a crucial role in the complete metabolism of gellan.
TI  - Exo-mode of action of cellobiohydrolase Cel48C from Paenibacillus sp. BP-23. A unique type of cellulase among Bacillales.
AB  - Sequence analysis of a Paenibacillus sp. BP-23 recombinant clone coding for a previously described endoglucanase revealed the presence of an additional truncated ORF with homology to family 48 glycosyl hydrolases. The corresponding 3509-bp DNA fragment was isolated after gene walking and cloned in Escherichia coli Xl1-Blue for expression and purification. The encoded enzyme, a cellulase of 1091 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 118 kDa and a pI of 4.85, displayed a multidomain organization bearing a canonical family 48 catalytic domain, a bacterial type 3a cellulose-binding module, and a putative fibronectin-III domain. The cloned cellulase, unique among Bacillales and designated Cel48C, was purified through affinity chromatography using its ability to bind Avicel. Maximum activity was achieved at 45 degrees C and pH 6.0 on acid-swollen cellulose, bacterial microcrystalline cellulose, Avicel and cellodextrins, whereas no activity was found on carboxy methyl cellulose, cellobiose, cellotriose, pNP-glycosides or 4-methylumbeliferyl alpha-d-glucoside. Cellobiose was the major product of cellulose hydrolysis, identifying Cel48C as a processive cellobiohydrolase. Although no chromogenic activity was detected from pNP-glycosides, TLC analysis revealed the release of p-nitrophenyl-glycosides and cellodextrins from these substrates, suggesting that Cel48C acts from the reducing ends of the sugar chain. Presence of such a cellobiohydrolase in Paenibacillus sp. BP-23 would contribute to widen up its range of action on natural cellulosic substrates.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of a novel unsaturated glucuronyl  hydrolase from Bacillus sp. GL1.
AB  - Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase from Bacillus sp. GL1 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of unsaturated glucuronic acids from oligosaccharides produced by the reactions of polysaccharide lyases such as gellan, xanthan, hyaluronate and chondroitin lyases. The enzyme was crystallized at 293 K from a droplet containing 56% MPD, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M glycine-NaOH pH 8.2 and 0.1 M dithiothreitol using the vapour-diffusion method. The crystals were hexagonal and belonged to space group P6(1)22 or P6(5)22, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 102.8, c = 223.4 A. Diffraction data to 2.4 A were collected from a single crystal.
TI  - AhlD, an N-acylhomoserine lactonase in Arthrobacter sp., and predicted homologues in other bacteria.
AB  - Quorum sensing is a signalling mechanism that controls diverse biological functions, including virulence, via N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. With the aim of isolating strains or enzymes capable of blocking quorum sensing by inactivating AHL, bacteria were screened for AHL degradation by their ability to utilize N-3-oxohexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (OHHL) as the sole carbon source. Among four isolates, strain IBN110, identified as Arthrobacter sp., was found to grow rapidly on OHHL, and to degrade various AHLs with different lengths and acyl side-chain substitutions. Co-culture of Arthrobacter sp. IBN110 and the plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora significantly reduced both the AHL amount and pectate lyase activity in co-culture medium, suggesting the possibility of applying Arthrobacter sp. IBN110 in the control of AHL-producing pathogenic bacteria. The ahlD gene from Arthrobacter sp. IBN110 encoding the enzyme catalysing AHL degradation was cloned, and found to encode a protein of 273 amino acids. A mass spectrometry analysis showed that AhlD probably hydrolyses the lactone ring of N-3-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone, indicating that AhlD is an N-acylhomoserine lactonase (AHLase). A comparison of AhlD with other known AHL-degrading enzymes, Bacillus sp. 240B1 AiiA, a Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kyushuensis AiiA homologue and Agrobacterium tumefaciens AttM, revealed 25, 26 and 21 % overall identities, respectively, in the deduced amino acid sequences. Although these identities were relatively low, the HXDH approximately H approximately D motif was conserved in all the AHLases, suggesting that this motif is essential for AHLase activity. From a genome database search based on the conserved motif, putative AhlD-like lactonase genes were found in several other bacteria, and AHL-degrading activities were observed in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus stearothermophilus. Furthermore, it was verified that ahlK, an ahlD homologue, encodes an AHL-degrading enzyme in K. pneumoniae. Accordingly, the current results suggest the possibility that AhlD-like AHLases could exist in many other micro-organisms.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the ces10 gene encoding a Sphingomonas paucimobilis esterase.
AB  - The ces10 gene of the gellan gum-producing strain Sphingomonas paucimobilis ATCC  31461 was cloned and sequenced. Multi-sequence alignment of the deduced protein indicated that Ces10 belongs to the serine hydrolase family with a potential catalytic triad comprising Ser(153) (within the G-X-S-X-G consensus sequence), His(75) and Asp(125). The mixed block results obtained following pattern search and the low identities detected in a BLAST analysis indicate that Ces10 is significantly different from other characterised bacterial esterases/lipases. Nevertheless, the Ces10 amino acid sequence showed 45% similarity with Rhodococcus sp. heroin esterase and 48% with Bacillus subtilis p-nitrobenzyl esterase. Ces10, with a predicted molecular mass of 30,641 Da, was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity in a histidine-tagged form. Enzyme assays using p-nitrophenyl-esters (p-NP-esters) with different acyl chain-lengths as the substrate confirmed the anticipated esterase activity. Ces10 exhibited a marked preference for short-chain fatty acids, yielding the highest activity with p-NP-propionate (optimal pH 7.4, optimal temperature 37 degrees C).
TI  - A novel member of glycoside hydrolase family 88: overexpression, purification, and characterization of unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of Bacillus sp. GL1.
AB  - Unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of Bacillus sp. GL1 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of unsaturated glucuronic acids from oligosaccharides produced through the reactions of polysaccharide lyases such as gellan, xanthan, hyaluronate, and chondroitin lyases. An overexpression system for the enzyme was constructed in Escherichia coli cells involving regulation of the enzyme gene under the T7 promoter and terminator. The expression level of the enzyme in E. coli cells was 250-fold higher than that in Bacillus sp. GL1 cells. The enzyme expressed in E. coli cells was purified and characterized. The optimal pH and temperature, and substrate specificity of the purified enzyme were similar to those of the native enzyme from Bacillus sp. GL1 cells, although the enzyme expressed in E. coli cells underwent self-assembly into polymeric forms through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Circular dichroism analysis indicated that the secondary structure of the enzyme was rich in alpha-helices. Genes showing high identity (over 40% identity) with that of the enzyme were found in the genomes of some pathogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause serious diseases (e.g., meningitis and pneumonia). Therefore, the enzyme of Bacillus sp. GL1 and the streptococcal proteins form a new glycoside hydrolase family, 88.
TI  - Crystal structure of thermostable aspartase from Bacillus sp. YM55-1: structure-based exploration of functional sites in the aspartase family.
AB  - The crystal structure of the thermostable aspartase from Bacillus sp. YM55-1 has  been solved and refined for 2.5A resolution data with an R-factor of 22.1%. The present enzyme is a homotetramer with subunits composed of three domains. It exhibits no allosteric effects, in contrast to the Escherichia coli aspartase, which is activated by divalent metal cation and L-aspartate, but is four-times more active than the E.coli enzyme. The overall folding of the present enzyme subunit is similar to those of the E.coli aspartase and the E.coli fumarase C, both of which belong to the same superfamily as the present enzyme. A local structural comparison of these three enzymes revealed seven structurally different regions. Five of the regions were located around putative functional sites, suggesting the involvement of these regions into the functions characteristic of the enzymes. Of these regions, the region of Gln96-Gly100 is proposed as a part of the recognition site of the alpha-amino group in L-aspartate for aspartase and the hydroxyl group in L-malate for fumarase. The region of Gln315-Gly323 is a flexible loop with a well-conserved sequence that is suggested to be involved in the catalytic reaction. The region of Lys123-Lys128 corresponds to a part of the putative activator-binding site in the E.coli fumarase C. The region in the Bacillus aspartase, however, adopts a main-chain conformation that prevents the activator binding. The regions of Gly228-Glu241 and Val265-Asp272, which form a part of the active-site wall, are suggested to be involved in the allosteric activation of the E.coli aspartase by the binding of the metal ion and the activator. Moreover, an increase in the numbers of intersubunit hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges is observed in the Bacillus aspartase relative to those of the E.coli enzyme, implying a contribution to the thermostability of the present aspartase.
TI  - Evaluation of preservative systems in a sunscreen formula by linear regression method.
AB  - A sunscreen formula with eight different preservative systems was evaluated by linear regression, pharmacopeial, and the CTFA (Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association) methods. The preparations were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Shewanella putrefaciens, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus sp. The linear regression method proved to be useful in the selection of the most effective preservative system used in cosmetic formulation.
TI  - High-level expression of a novel FMN-dependent heme-containing lyase, phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase of Bacillus sp. strain OxB-1, in heterologous hosts.
AB  - We examined the overexpression of a novel FMN-dependent heme-containing lyase, phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) of Bacillus sp. strain OxB-1, in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Several plasmids were constructed to express the enzyme under the control of the lac promoter or its own promoter, together with or without nitrilase and a possible regulatory protein that is present in the wild-type genome. The enzyme was expressed using E. coli transfected with the plasmid pOxD-9OF. Expression was under the control of the lac promoter in the pUC18 vector and was much more effective when the start codon was changed from TTG to ATG. When the transfected cells were grown at 37 degrees C, the enzyme was produced mainly in inactive inclusion bodies, whereas the enzyme was largely soluble and active when the cells were grown at 30 degrees C. The production of active enzyme was markedly enhanced by increasing the volume of culture medium. This had the effect of slowing the rate of apoenzyme synthesis. A slow rate of synthesis allows for a more efficient incorporation of heme cofactor into the apoenzyme than a fast rate of synthesis. Under optimized conditions, the enzyme was produced in an active and soluble form at 15,000U/L of culture, which is about 1500-fold higher than the amount produced by the wild-type strain. Moreover, the enzyme comprised over 40% of total extractable cellular protein.
TI  - Eudistomins W and X, two new beta-carbolines from the micronesian tunicate Eudistoma sp.
AB  - Chemical investigation of the Micronesian ascidian Eudistoma sp. afforded two new eudistomin congeners, which were designated eudistomins W (1) and X (2). The structures of the new compounds were unambiguously established on the basis of NMR spectroscopic ((1)H, (13)C, COSY, (1)H detected direct, and long-range (13)C-(1)H correlations) and mass spectrometric (EI and ESIMS) data. Compound 2 exhibited antibiotic activity toward Bacillus subtilis, Staphyloccocus aureus, and Escherichia coli and was also found to be fungicidal against Candida albicans in an agar diffusion assay. Compound 1 was selectively active against C. albicans but showed no antibacterial activity.
TI  - Replacement of methionine 208 in a truncated Bacillus sp. TS-23 alpha-amylase with oxidation-resistant leucine enhances its resistance to hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The methionine residues at positions 17, 104, 208, 214, 292, 315, 324, and 446 in the primary amino acid sequence of a truncated Bacillus sp. TS-23 alpha-amylase (His(6)-tagged BLADeltaNC) was changed to oxidative-resistant leucine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant enzymes with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 54 kDa were overexpressed in recombinant Escherichia coli. The specific activity for Met315Leu and Met446Leu was decreased by more than 76%, while Met17Leu, Met104Leu, Met208Leu, Met214Leu, Met292Leu, and Met324Leu showed 247, 128, 37, 260, 232, and 241%, respectively, higher activity than the wild-type enzyme. In comparison with wild-type enzyme, a lower K(m) value was observed for all mutant enzymes. The 3.2- and 4.5-fold increases in the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) for Met208Leu and Met324Leu, respectively, were partly contributed by a 68% and 38% decrease in K(m) values. Wild-type enzyme was sensitive to chemical oxidation, but Met208Leu was stable even in the presence of 500 mM H(2)O(2). Except for Met214Leu, which was quite sensitive to H(2)O(2), the other mutants showed a profile of oxidative inactivation similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. These observations indicate that the oxidative stability of His(6)-tagged BLADeltaNC can be improved by replacement of the critical methionine residue with leucine.
TI  - [Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of oligo-1,6-glucosidase gene from Bacillus subtilis HB002].
AB  - The gene coding for oligo-1,6-glucosidase of Bacillus subtilis HB002 was cloned by the shotgun-cloning method and sequenced by the chain-termination method of Sanger et al. It consists of an open reading frame of 1683 bp. The amino acid sequence of oligo-1,6-glucosidase deduced from its nuecleotide sequence predicts a protein of 561 amino acid residues with a Mr of 65.985 kD, which is 81% and 67% identical to those of oligo-1,6-glucosidase from Bacillus sp. and Bacillus coagulans, respectively, 89% and 79% similar to those of oligo-1,6-glucosidase from Bacillus sp. and Bacillus coagulans, respectively. The oligo-1,6-glucosidase gene of Bacillus subtilis HB002 was cloned into Escherichia coli expression plasmid pBV220, the result of SDS-PAGE showed that the oligo-1,6-glucosidase gene had been expressed in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha, the expressed oligo-1, 6-glucosidase has enzymatic activity.
TI  - [Cloning and DNA sequencing of Bacillus pumilus endo-1,4-beta-glucanase gene].
AB  - Bacillus pumilus S-27 screened from marine environment produces an extracellular  endo-1,4-beta-glucanase. The enzyme has its optimal activity at pH 5.0-7.0 and 55 degrees C and still retained 79.0% of it at pH 9.0. The gene encoded this endo-1,4-beta-glucanase was cloned and sequenced. The structural gene contained an open reading frame of 1980 bp, corresponding to 660 amino acids, the amino acid sequence of this enzyme is very close to that of an EG of C. cellulovorans and an EG of Bacillus sp. KSM-522, all belong to the cellulase family E2.
TI  - Lethal factor to mice produced by Escherichia coli isolated from chickens with swollen head syndrome.
AB  - A lethal toxin similar to Bacillus cererus lethal toxin was detected in the culture supernatants of Escherichia coli isolated from chickens with swollen head syndrome. The lethal activity was heat-labile, protease-sensitive and killed mice within 10 min. The light microscopy of the histopathological studies revealed that the principal organ affected by this toxin was the lung but the liver and kidneys also showed lesions. The relevance of this lethal activity from E. coli remains to be determined.
TI  - Effects of ozone treatment on cell growth and ultrastructural changes in bacteria.
AB  - Ozone appeared to inhibit growth and caused the death of gram negative and gram positive tested bacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. Bacterial cultures at 10(3), 10(4), 10(5), 10(6), and 10(7) cfu/ml dilution were exposed to 0.167/mg/min/L of ozone at different time intervals (0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min). Cell viability was observed in all types of tested bacteria at 10(3), 10(4), 10(3) cfu/ml within 30 min after ozone exposure. However, cell inactivation was not significantly observed at concentrations of 10(6), 10(7) cfu/ml even after an exposure of 150 min. Ultrastructural changes of treated bacteria showed deformation, rough damage and surface destruction revealed by scanning electron microscopy. Some bacterial cells showed collapsed and shrunken patterns within 60 min and severe rupture and cellular lysis after 90 min of ozone treatment. This study supports the proposed mechanism of the bacteria inactivation by ozone that caused cell membrane destruction and finally lysis reaction. Thus, the precaution of using ozone as a biocide should be used to address appropriate concentrations of bacterial contamination in water.
TI  - Meroterpenes from Penicillium sp found in association with Melia azedarach.
AB  - A Penicillium sp was isolated from the root bark of Melia azedarach and cultivated over sterilized rice. After chromatographic procedures, two meroterpenes, named preaustinoid A and B, were obtained in addition to the known alkaloid verruculogen. Their structures were identified by extensive spectroscopic studies, and they exhibited moderate bacteriostatic effects on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus sp.
TI  - Limnazine, the first bacterial azine derivative from Bacillus sp. GW90a.
AB  - A novel dimeric azine derivative designated as limnazine (1) has been isolated from the culture broth of an aquatic Bacillus sp. strain GW90a. The structure has been elucidated, on the basis of spectral data, as N,N'-bis(2,2,6-trimethylchroman-4-ylidene)azine and was additionally confirmed by synthesis. Limnazine (1) is inactive against algae, fungi, and bacteria.
TI  - Pharacine, a natural p-cyclophane and other indole derivatives from Cytophaga sp. strain AM13.1.
AB  - From the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial strain Cytophaga sp. AM13.1, among many known compounds, the new natural products 2,5-bis(3-indolylmethyl)pyrazine (2) and a highly symmetrical p-cyclophane named pharacine (5) were identified. In addition, tryptamine isovalerate (1) and p-hydroxyphenylacetamide (4), known as plant metabolites, were isolated and characterized from a microorganism for the first time. The new natural products showed no activity against three microalgae, the fungus Mucor miehei, the yeast Candida albicans, and the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillussubtilis, Escherichia coli, and Streptomyces viridochromogenes.
TI  - Recognition and hydrolysis of noncrystalline cellulose.
AB  - Cellulase Cel5A from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. 1139 contains a family 17 carbohydrate-binding module (BspCBM17) and a family 28 CBM (BspCBM28) in tandem. The two modules have significantly similar amino acid sequences, but amino acid residues essential for binding are not conserved. BspCBM28 was obtained as a discrete polypeptide by engineering the cel5A gene. BspCBM17 could not be obtained as a discrete polypeptide, so a family 17 CBM from endoglucanase Cel5A of Clostridium cellulovorans, CcCBM17, was used to compare the binding characteristics of the two families of CBM. Both CcCBM17 and BspCBM28 recognized two classes of binding sites on amorphous cellulose: a high affinity site (K(a) approximately 1 x 10(6) M(-1)) and a low affinity site (K(a) approximately 2 x 10(4) M(-1)). They did not compete for binding to the high affinity sites, suggesting that they bound at different sites on the cellulose. A polypeptide, BspCBM17/CBM28, comprising the tandem CBMs from Cel5A, bound to amorphous cellulose with a significantly higher affinity than the sum of the affinities of CcCBM17 and BspCBM28, indicating cooperativity between the linked CBMs. Cel5A mutants were constructed that were defective in one or both of the CBMs. The mutants differed from the wild-type enzyme in the amounts and sizes of the soluble products produced from amorphous cellulose. This suggests that either the CBMs can modify the action of the catalytic module of Cel5A or that they target the enzyme to areas of the cellulose that differ in susceptibility to hydrolysis.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties and phytochemical constituents of the leaves of African  mistletoe (Tapinanthus dodoneifolius (DC) Danser) (Loranthaceae): an ethnomedicinal plant of Hausaland, Northern Nigeria.
AB  - African mistletoe (Tapinanthus dodoneifolius (DC) Danser) called 'Kauchi' in Hausa is a hemi-plant parasite used ethnomedicinally by the Hausa and the Fulani tribes of Northern Nigeria as a remedy for several human and animal ailments that include stomach ache, diarrhoea, dysentery, wound and cancer. Screening of the plant, obtained from 14 different hosts, revealed a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activities against certain multiple drug resistant bacterial and fungal isolates of farm animals. Interestingly, the inhibition of the growth of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bacillus sp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Proteus sp. and Pseudomonas sp., bacterial sp. known to be associated with either crown gall or gastrointestinal tract and wound infections, by extracts of T. dodoneifolius gives credence to the ethnomedicinal usage of the plant. Phytochemical screening showed the common occurrence of anthraquinones, saponins, and tannins, a rare presence of alkaloids and the absence of phlobatannins in the hemi-parasite. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity and the presence or distribution of phytochemical substances in T. dodoneifolius appeared to be partly dependent on the host plant species.
TI  - Localization of Mn(II)-oxidizing activity and the putative multicopper oxidase, MnxG, to the exosporium of the marine Bacillus sp. strain SG-1.
AB  - Dormant spores of the marine Bacillus sp. strain SG-1 catalyze the oxidation of manganese(II), thereby becoming encrusted with insoluble Mn(III,IV) oxides. In this study, it was found that the Mn(II)-oxidizing activity could be removed from SG-1 spores using a French press and recovered in the supernatant following centrifugation of the spores. Transmission electron microscopy of thin sections of SG-1 spores revealed that the ridged outermost layer was removed by passage through the French press, leaving the remainder of the spore intact. Comparative chemical analysis of this layer with the underlying spore coats suggested that this outer layer is chemically distinct from the spore coat. Taken together, these results indicate that this outer layer is an exosporium. Previous genetic analysis of strain SG-1 identified a cluster of genes involved in Mn(II) oxidation, the mnx genes. The product of the most downstream gene in this cluster, MnxG, appears to be a multicopper oxidase and is essential for Mn(II) oxidation. In this study, MnxG was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and used to generate polyclonal antibodies. Western blot analysis demonstrated that MnxG is localized to the exosporium of wild-type spores but is absent in the non-oxidizing spores of transposon mutants within the mnx gene cluster. To our knowledge, Mn(II) oxidation is the first oxidase activity, and MnxG one of the first gene products, ever shown to be associated with an exosporium.
TI  - Screening of eight alkaloids and ten flavonoids isolated from four species of the genus Boronia (Rutaceae) for antimicrobial activities against seventeen clinical microbial strains.
AB  - Eight alkaloids and ten flavonoids isolated from four species of Boronia of the Rutaceae were screened against 17 clinical microbial strains. Of the test compounds, three acridone and one quinolone alkaloids and eight flavonoids were reported as novel natural products. Screening was carried out by the standard disc diffusion method. Of the tested compounds, six alkaloids and seven flavonoids including the novel products were active against six clinical strains. The active compounds showed mild to moderate activities against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, exterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella sp. Of the active flavonoids, some exhibited fairly significant activity towards Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella sp. The flavonoids were observed to have higher spectrum and magnitude of activity than those of the alkaloids. A standard ampicillin disc was used to compare the results.
TI  - Effects of salts on the conformation and catalytic properties of d-amino acid aminotransferase.
AB  - The effects of salts on the biochemical properties of D-amino acid aminotransferase from Bacillus sp. YM-1 have been studied to elucidate both the inhibitory effects of salts on the activity and the protective effects of salts on the substrate-induced inactivation. The results from UV-visible spectroscopy studies on the reaction of the enzyme with D-serine revealed that salt significantly reduced the rate of the formation of the quinonoid intermediate and its accumulation. The kinetic and spectroscopy studies of the reaction with alpha-[(2)H]-DL-serine in different concentrations of NaCl provided evidence that the rate-limiting step was changed from the deprotonation of the external aldimine to another step(s), presumably to the hydrolysis of the ketimine. Gel filtration chromatography data in the presence of NaCl showed that the enzyme volume was reduced sharply with the increasing NaCl concentration, up to 100 mM. An additional increase of the NaCl concentration did not affect the elution volume, which suggests that the enzyme has a limited number of salt-binding groups. These results provide detailed mechanistic evidence for the way salts inhibit the catalytic activity of Damino acid aminotransferase
TI  - New estimation methods of bacterial concentration by measuring ATP changes during incubation.
AB  - New estimation methods of bacterial cell concentration in samples by measurement  of the increase in bacterial adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) content during incubation using a conventional firefly luminometer were established. When an Escherichia coli cell suspension was incubated in nutrient broth, the increase in the ATP content of the suspension during the incubation period followed a sigmoidal curve. The increase ratio of the ATP content of the suspension at a given period of incubation (5 hours in this study) to the initial ATP content was greater at higher initial cell concentrations. With this relationship, the initial cell concentration of a test suspension could be predicted from the measured ratio; this was called the end point method. On the other hand, the lag period in the ATP increase curve was longer at lower initial cell concentrations. A highly linear relationship was observed between the lag period and the logarithm of the initial cell concentrations. Based on this relationship, a delay method was developed for prediction. The two relationships were also observed for bacterial suspensions of Klebsiella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas sp. These results suggested that the two methods have the potential to estimate the bacterial cell concentration of a sample suspension.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - Specific phosphorothioate substitutions probe the active site of Bacillus subtilis ribonuclease P.
AB  - Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ribonucleoprotein that requires magnesium ions to catalyze the 5' maturation of transfer RNA. To identify interactions essential for catalysis, the properties of RNase P containing single sulfur substitutions for nonbridging phosphodiester oxygens in helix P4 of Bacillus subtilis RNase P were analyzed using transient kinetic experiments. Sulfur substitution at the nonbridging oxygens of the phosphodiester bond of nucleotide U51 only modestly affects catalysis. However, phosphorothioate substitutions at A49 and G50 decrease the cleavage rate constant enormously (300-4,000-fold for P RNA and 500-15,000-fold for RNase P holoenzyme) in magnesium without affecting the affinity of pre-tRNA(Asp), highlighting the importance of this region for catalysis. Furthermore, addition of manganese enhances pre-tRNA cleavage catalyzed by B. subtilis RNase P RNA containing an Sp phosphorothioate modification at A49, as observed for Escherichia coli P RNA [Christian et al., RNA, 2000, 6:511-519], suggesting that an essential metal ion may be coordinated at this site. In contrast, no manganese rescue is observed for the A49 Sp phosphorothioate modification in RNase P holoenzyme. These differential manganese rescue effects, along with affinity cleavage, suggest that the protein component may interact with a metal ion bound near A49 in helix P4 of P RNA.
TI  - The activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  - p-Methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from Lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and STD activity. MIC determinations were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrheae, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Psuedomanas aeruginosa. An in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microM (17,9 microg/mL) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living cells.
TI  - Genes encoding the N-acyl homoserine lactone-degrading enzyme are widespread in many subspecies of Bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria can communicate with each other by N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), which are quorum-sensing autoinducers. Recently, the aiiA gene (encoding an enzyme catalyzing the degradation of AHL) has been cloned from Bacillus sp. strain 240B1. During investigations in the course of the ongoing Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. morrisoni genome project, an aiiA homologue gene in the genome sequence was found. These results led to consideration of the possibility of the widespread existence of the gene in B. thuringiensis. aiiA homologue genes were found in 16 subspecies of B. thuringiensis, and their sequences were determined. Comparison of the Bacillus sp. strain 240B1 aiiA gene with the B. thuringiensis aiiA homologue genes showed high homologies of 89 to 95% and 90 to 96% in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence, respectively. Among the subspecies of B. thuringiensis having an aiiA gene, the subspecies aizawai, galleriae, kurstaki, kyushuensis, ostriniae, and subtoxicus were shown to degrade AHL. It was observed that recombinant Escherichia coli producing AiiA proteins also had AHL-degrading activity and could also attenuate the plant pathogenicity of Erwinia carotovora. These results indicate that insecticidal B. thuringiensis strains might have potential to compete with gram-negative bacteria in natural ecosystems by autoinducer-degrading activity.
TI  - Deletion analysis of the C-terminal region of the alpha-amylase of Bacillus sp. strain TS-23.
AB  - The alpha-amylase from Bacillus sp. strain TS-23 is a secreted starch hydrolase with a domain organization similar to that of other microbial alpha-amylases and an additional functionally unknown domain (amino acids 517-613) in the C-terminal region. By sequence comparison, we found that this latter domain contained a sequence motif typical for raw-starch binding. To investigate the functional role of the C-terminal region of the alpha-amylase of Bacillus sp. strain TS-23, four His(6)-tagged mutants with extensive deletions in this region were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. SDS-PAGE and activity staining analyses showed that the N- and C-terminally truncated alpha-amylases had molecular masses of approximately 65, 58, 54, and 49 kDa. Progressive loss of raw-starch-binding activity occurred upon removal of C-terminal amino acid residues, indicating the requirement for the entire region in formation of a functional starch-binding domain. Up to 98 amino acids from the C-terminal end of the alpha-amylase could be deleted without significant effect on the raw-starch hydrolytic activity or thermal stability. Furthermore, the active mutants hydrolyzed raw corn starch to produce maltopentaose as the main product, suggesting that the raw-starch hydrolytic activity of the Bacillus sp. strain TS-23 alpha-amylase is functional and independent from the starch-binding domain.
TI  - Cloning of a gene encoding raw-starch-digesting amylase from a Cytophaga sp. and  its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A raw-starch-digesting amylase (RSDA) gene from a Cytophaga sp. was cloned and sequenced. The predicted protein product contained 519 amino acids and had high amino acid identity to alpha-amylases from three Bacillus species. Only one of the Bacillus alpha-amylases has raw-starch-digesting capability, however. The RSDA, expressed in Escherichia coli, had properties similar to those of the enzyme purified from the Cytophaga sp.
TI  - Purification, characterization and cloning of a chitinase from Bacillus sp. NCTU2.
AB  - A chitin-degrading Bacillus strain, designated as NCTU2, was screened from soil and identified. An extracellular chitinase was purified to >90% homogeneity from the culture filtrate. The purification involved hydrophobic-interaction and gel-filtration chromatographic separations with a yield of 58%. The purified enzyme (ChiNCTU2) is a monomeric protein with an estimated molecular mass of 36.5 kDa and a pI of 6.3. It is thermally stable at 60 degrees C and pH 6-8 for more than 3 h. The optimal activity is in the range of 50-60 degrees C at pH 7.0. Chitobiose is the predominant product throughout the enzymic hydrolysis of the colloidal chitin, indicating that the purified chitinase is an exo-chitinase. Chito-oligosaccharides [with degree of polymerization (DP) values of 4-6] are good substrates of the purified enzyme, whereas a DP3 oligomer was slowly hydrolysed to form DP1 and DP2 sugars. The first 15 N-terminal amino acids of the enzyme were determined to be ANNLGSKLLVGYWHN, which is highly homologous to that of ChiA from Bacillus cereus. A PCR cloning technique was employed to obtain the corresponding gene from Bacillus NCTU2. The gene sequence was determined to be 1080 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 360 amino acids with the first 27 amino acids as the signal peptide.
TI  - Antifungal garcinia acid esters from the fruits of Garcinia atroviridis.
AB  - Two new garcinia acid derivatives, 2-(butoxycarbonylmethyl)-3-butoxycarbonyl-2-hydroxy-3-propanolide and 1',1"-dibutyl methyl hydroxycitrate, were isolated from the fruits of Garcinia atroviridis guided by TLC bioautography against the fungus Cladosporium herbarum. The structures of these compounds were established by spectral analysis. The former compound represents a unique beta-lactone structure and the latter compound is most likely an artefact of garcinia acid (= hydroxycitric acid). Both compounds showed selective antifungal activity comparable to that of cycloheximide (MID: 0.5 microg/spot) only against C herbarum at the MIDs of 0.4 and 0.8 microg/spot but were inactive against bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli), other fungi (Alternaria sp., Fusarium moniliforme and Aspergillus ochraceous) including the yeast Candida albicans.
TI  - CAY-I, a fungicidal saponin from Capsicum sp. fruit.
AB  - Saponins are steroidal or terpenoid-based glycosides with surface active properties. A steroidal saponin, CAY-1, with a molecular weight of 1243.35 Da, was isolated and purified to homogeneity from commercially available dry, ground fruit of Capsicum frutescens. CAY-1 was shown to be a potent fungicide for the germinating conidia of Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, A. parasiticus and A. niger with species-dependent LD90 values between 3 and 20 microM. Activity against some Aspergillus species was affected by the test medium used. In vitro assays, CAY-1 was effective against Pneumocystis carinii (IC50): 9.5 microM) and Candida albicans (IC90: 6.2 microM). CAY-1 had no effect on the viability of the nongerminating conidia of the two filamentous fungi, P. carinii and C. albicans, nor on the conidial type of Fusarium oxysporum. It was ineffective against the bacteria Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. CAY-1 was not cytotoxic to A 549 lung carcinoma cells or HeLa cells at effective fungicidal concentrations. The results indicate that CAY-1 is an effective fungicide for Aspergillus species, C. albicans and P. carinii at concentrations below the threshold for mammalian cell toxicity.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  - Germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after they were colonized with a pure culture of Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecalis not only induced IBD (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the IL-10 KO mice. Conventional (complex-intestinal flora) IL-10 KO mice developed IBD within 10 to 15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with E. faecalis-induced IBD in gnotobiotic IL-10 KO mice. Conversely, neither germ-free IL-10 mice nor IL-10 KO mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, L. reuteri, L. acidophilus, a Bifidobacterium sp., Lactococcus lactis, or a Bacillus sp. developed IBD during the 25- to 30-week study. E. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger IBD, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.
TI  - Cobalt activation of Bacillus BR449 thermostable nitrile hydratase expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Expression of nitrile hydratase enzymes utilized in a new "green" process for acrylamide production has proven difficult in Escherichia coli owing to lack of a cobalt transport system to introduce the required cobalt ion into this host. We describe the expression of a thermostable nitrile hydratase from a moderate thermophile Bacillus sp. BR449 in E. coliin which the cobalt required for enzyme activation is introduced by incubation of the apoenzyme in the presence of Co++ ion at 50 degrees C, yielding active and thermostable enzyme.
TI  - High yield synthesis of nitriles by a new enzyme, phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase, from Bacillus sp. strain OxB-1.
AB  - 3-Phenylpropionitrile was synthesized from Z-3-phenylpropionaldoxime (0.75 M) in  a quantitative yield (98 g/l) by the use of cells of Escherichia coli JM 109/pOxD-90F, a transformant harboring a gene for a new enzyme, phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase, from Bacillus sp. strain OxB-1. Other arylalkyl- and alkyl-nitriles were also synthesized in high yields from the corresponding aldoximes. Moreover, 3-phenylpropionitrile was successfully synthesized by the recombinant cells in 70 and 100% yields from 0.1 M unpurified E/Z-3-phenylpropionaldoxime, which is spontaneously formed from 3-phenylpropionaldehyde and hydroxylamine in a butyl acetate/water biphasic system and aqueous phase, respectively.
TI  - Flavones inhibit the hexameric replicative helicase RepA.
AB  - Helicases couple the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) to the unwinding of double-stranded nucleic acids and are essential in DNA metabolism. Thus far, no inhibitors are known for helicases except heliquinomycin isolated from Streptomyces sp. As the three-dimensional structure of the hexameric replicative DNA helicase RepA encoded by the broad host-range plasmid RSF1010 is known, this protein served as a model helicase to search for inhibitory compounds. The commercially available flavone derivatives luteolin, morin, myricetin and dimyricetin (an oxidation product of myricetin) inhibited the ATPase and double-stranded DNA unwinding activities of RepA. Dimyricetin was the most effective inhibitor for both activities. Single-stranded DNA-dependent RepA ATPase activity is inhibited non-competitively by all four compounds. This finding contrasts the inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by flavones that fit into the ATP binding pocket of this enzyme. Myricetin also inhibited the growth of a Gram-positive and a Gram-negative bacterial species. As we found other hexameric and non-hexameric prokaryotic helicases to be differentially sensitive to myricetin, flavones may provide substructures for the design of molecules helpful for unraveling the mechanism of helicase action and of novel pharmacologically useful molecules.
TI  - Antifungal alkyl amino alcohols from the tropical marine sponge Haliclona n. sp.
AB  - Three new amino alcohols presumably deriving from L-alanine were isolated from the tropical marine sponge Haliclona n. sp. and characterized by 2D NMR, while a fourth amino alcohol was characterized as an acetamide derivative. Relative stereochemistry was deduced from the NMR characteristics of oxazolidinone derivatives and absolute stereochemistry secured by preparation and analysis of an MPA ester. The amino alcohol fraction from Haliclona n. sp. acts as an antifungal agent and inhibits the development of larvae of the ascidian Herdmania curvata.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of Mn(2+)-dependent sphingomyelinase/hemolysin of an aquatic bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain TK4.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and expression of a hemolytic sphingomyelinase from an aquatic bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain TK4. The sphingomyelinase gene was found to consist of 1,548 nucleotides encoding 516 amino acid residues. The recombinant 57.7-kDa enzyme hydrolyzed sphingomyelin but not phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that the enzyme is a sphingomyelin-specific sphingomyelinase C. The hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the enzyme was found to be most efficient at pH 8.0 and activated by Mn(2+). The enzyme shows quite a broad specificity, i.e., it hydrolyzed 4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-sphingomyelin with short-chain fatty acids and NBD-sphingosylphosphorylcholine, the latter being completely resistant to hydrolysis by any sphingomyelinase reported so far. Significant sequence similarities were found in sphingomyelinases from Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria ivanovii, and Leptospira interrogans, as well as a hypothetical protein encoded in Chromobacterium violaceum, although the first three lacked one-third of the sequence corresponding to that from the C terminus of the TK4 enzyme. Interestingly, the deletion mutant of strain TK4 lacking 186 amino acids at the C-terminal end hydrolyzed sphingomyelin, whereas it lost all hemolytic activity, indicating that the C-terminal region of the TK4 enzyme is indispensable for the hemolytic activity.
TI  - The twin-arginine signal peptide of PhoD and the TatAd/Cd proteins of Bacillus subtilis form an autonomous Tat translocation system.
AB  - The bacterial twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway has been recently described for PhoD of Bacillus subtilis, a phosphodiesterase containing a twin-arginine signal peptide. The expression of phoD is co-regulated with the expression of tatA(d) and tatC(d) genes localized downstream of phoD. To characterize the specificity of PhoD transport further, translocation of PhoD was investigated in Escherichia coli. By using gene fusions, we analyzed the particular role of the signal peptide and the mature region of PhoD in canalizing the transport route. A hybrid protein consisting of the signal peptide of beta-lactamase and mature PhoD was transported in a Sec-dependent manner indicating that the mature part of PhoD does not contain information canalizing the selected translocation route. Pre-PhoD, as well as a fusion protein consisting of the signal peptide of PhoD (SP(PhoD)) and beta-galactosidase (LacZ), remained cytosolic in the E. coli. Thus, SP(PhoD) is not recognized by E. coli transport systems. Co-expression of B. subtilis tatA(d)/C(d) genes resulted in the processing of SP(PhoD)-LacZ and periplasmic localization of LacZ illustrating a close substrate specificity of the TatA(d)/C(d) transport system. While blockage of the Sec-dependent transport did not affect the localization of SP(PhoD)-LacZ, translocation and processing was dependent on the pH gradient of the cytosolic membrane. Thus, the minimal requirement of a functional Tat-dependent protein translocation system consists of a twin-arginine signal peptide-containing Tat substrate, its specific TatA/C proteins, and the pH gradient across the cytosolic membrane.
TI  - Characterization of the type IV restriction modification system BspLU11III from Bacillus sp. LU11.
AB  - We report the characterization and cloning of the genes for an unusual type IV restriction-modification system, BspLU11III, from Bacillus sp. LU11. The system consists of two methyltransferases and one endonuclease, which also possesses methyltransferase activity. The three genes of the restriction-modification system, bsplu11IIIMa, bsplu11IIIMb and bsplu11IIIR, are closely linked and tandemly arranged. The corresponding enzymes recognize the dsDNA sequence 5'-GGGAC-3'/5'-GTCCC-3', with M.BspLU11IIIa modifying the A (underlined) of one strand and M.BspLU11IIIb the inner C (underlined) of the other strand. R.BspLU11III has both endonuclease and adenine-specific methyltransferase activities and is able to protect the DNA against cleavage by itself. In contrast to all type IV restriction-modification systems described so far, which have only one adenine-specific methyltransferase, BspLU11III is the first type IV restriction-modification system that includes two methyltransferases, one of them being cytosine specific.
TI  - Cloning and expression of an endocellulase gene from a novel streptomycete isolated from an East African soda lake.
AB  - Alkaline cellulase-producing actinomycete strains were isolated from mud samples  collected from East African soda lakes. The strains were identified as novel Streptomyces spp. by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. A cellulase gene (cel12A) from Streptomyces sp. strain 11AG8 was cloned by expression screening of a genomic DNA library in Escherichia coli. From the nucleotide sequence of a 1.5-kb DNA fragment, an open reading frame of 1,113 nucleotides was identified encoding a protein of 371 amino acids. From computer analysis of the sequence, it was deduced that the Cel12A mature enzyme is a protein of 340 amino acids. The protein contained a catalytic domain, a glycine-rich linker region, and a cellulose-binding domain of 221, 12, and 107 amino acids, respectively. FASTA analysis of the catalytic domain of Cel12A classified the enzyme as a family 12 endoglucanase and the cellulose-binding domain as a family IIa CBD. Streptomyces rochei EglS was determined as nearest neighbor with a similarity of 75.2% and 61.0% to the catalytic domain and the cellulose-binding domain, respectively. The cell2A gene was subcloned in a Bacillus high-expression vector carrying the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens amylase regulatory sequences, and the construct was transformed to a Bacillus subtilis host strain. Crude enzyme preparations were obtained by ultrafiltration of cultures of the Bacillus subtilis recombinant strain containing the 11AG8 cell2A gene. The enzyme showed carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) activities over a broad pH range (5-10) with an optimum activity at pH 8 and 50 degrees C. The enzyme retained more than 95% of its activity after incubation for 30 min under these conditions.
TI  - Evaluation of extracts of the root of Landolphia owerrience for antibacterial activity.
AB  - Ethanolic and aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of Landolphia owerrience root parts (whole-root, root-bark and root-wood) were tested for activity against ten bacterial strains using agar-well diffusion and macro-broth dilution methods, respectively. The ethanolic extracts of the whole-root and root-wood were active against 100 and 80% of the test organisms, respectively. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of the root-bark were moderately active while the aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of the root-wood exhibited little or no activity. Out of the nine extracts prepared, 66.7% were active against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, 55.6% variously against each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and local clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi, 44.4% against Proteus sp., 33.3% against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051 and 22.2% against E. coli ATCC 11775. The agar-well-determined MIC values for the ethanolic whole-root extract (0.78-50 mg/ml) were higher (indicating lower activity) than the corresponding macro-broth-determined values (0.39-50 mg/ml) probably because of slow diffusion rates of the active constituents of the extract in agar. On the other hand, the differences could be due to the effects of DMSO used to dissolve the ethanolic extracts in the agar-well diffusion tests. Similar discrepancies in the MIC values detectable with the two test methods were apparent in the root-wood extract and the control drug, Gentamycin, except that in the latter the agar-well-determined MIC values (0.125-8.0 microg/ml) were lower than the macro-broth-determined values (0.125-64 microg/ml). The strong activity of the ethanolic extracts against known etiologic agents of diseases traditionally treated with L. owerrience root of similar preparations provides scientific justification for the use of the herb in ethnomedical practice in Nigeria.
TI  - nhaG Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene of Bacillus subtilis ATCC9372, which is missing in the complete genome sequence of strain 168, and properties of the antiporter.
AB  - We cloned a gene which enabled Escherichia coli mutant host cells lacking all of  the major Na(+)/H(+) antiporters to grow in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl from chromosomal DNA of Bacillus subtilis ATCC9372. An Na(+)/H(+) antiport activity was observed with membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli cells possessing the cloned gene, but not with vesicles from the host cells. Lithium ion was also a substrate for the antiporter. We sequenced the cloned DNA and found one open reading frame (designated nhaG) preceded by a promoter-like sequence and a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and followed by a terminator-like sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of NhaG suggested that it consisted of 524 residues and that the calculated molecular mass was 58.1 kDa. None of the bacterial Na(+)/H(+) antiporters so far reported, except NhaP of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and SynNhaP (NhaS1) of Synechocystis sp., showed significant sequence similarity with the NhaG. However, the NhaP, the SynNhaP, animal NHEs (Na(+)/H(+) exchangers), and some hypothetical Na(+)/H(+) antiporters of several organisms showed significant sequence similarities with the NhaG. Interestingly, the entire DNA region corresponding to the nhaG gene is missing in the reported complete genome sequence of B. subtilis strain 168. We detected a band that hybridized with the nhaG DNA in chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis ATCC9372 but not with that from strain 168. The missing DNA region (1,774 base pairs) is sandwiched by two identical sequences, TTTTCTT.
TI  - Secretory production of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF) is a glycoprotein, consisting of 174 amino acids, which plays an important role in hematopoietic cell proliferation, differentiation of hemopoietic precursor cells, and activation of mature neutrophilic granulocytes. In this study, secretory production of hG-CSF in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli using the Bacillus sp. endoxylanase signal peptide was examined. For the efficient expression of hG-CSF gene, the first five codons at the N-terminal were altered based on the E. coli high-frequency codon database. The hG-CSF gene fused to the endoxylanase signal sequence was expressed using an inducible trc promoter. However, recombinant E. coli cells were completely lysed after induction with 1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Insertion of a small oligopeptide (13 amino acids) containing the histidine hexamer and factor Xa cleavage site between the signal peptide and the mature hG-CSF protein allowed successful secretion of hG-CSF into the periplasm without cell lysis. Among the several E. coli strains examined, E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli MC4100 allowed production of hG-CSF to the highest levels (20-22% of total proteins) with the secretion efficiencies greater than 98%. The circular dichroism spectra showed that the conformation of purified hG-CSF is almost identical to native hG-CSF.
TI  - Bacillus sonorensis sp. nov., a close relative of Bacillus licheniformis, isolated from soil in the Sonoran Desert, Arizona.
AB  - Eight Bacillus strains isolated from Sonoran Desert soil were shown to belong to  a previously unidentified species, for which the name Bacillus sonorensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain L87-10T (= NRRL B-23154T). On the basis of phenotypic and genetic data, B. sonorensis is most closely related to Bacillus licheniformis. B. sonorensis can be distinguished from B. licheniformis by salt tolerance, pigmentation, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, reassociation of genomic DNA and sequence differences in protein-coding genes and 16S rRNA.
TI  - Cedarmycins A and B, new antimicrobial antibiotics from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0456.
AB  - Two novel butyrolactone antibiotics, cedarmycins A and B, were isolated from the  cultured broth of the actinomycete Streptomyces sp. TP-A0456. The new compounds were purified by HP-20 resin, silica gel, ODS column chromatographies and preparative HPLC, consecutively. The structure of cedarmycin was determined by spectroscopic methods as an alpha,beta-unsaturated butyrolactone with a fatty acid side chain. These compounds showed antibiotic activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and yeasts. Among the tested organisms, cedarmycins potently inhibited the growth of Candida glabrata IFO 0622 with the MIC of 0.4 microg/ml, comparable to that of amphotericin B.
TI  - Comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppGpp synthetases/hydrolases (the Rel, RelA and SpoT proteins).
AB  - In the gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppGpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, RelA and SpoT, whereas in the gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis only one enzyme named Rel is responsible for this activity. Rel and SpoT also possess (p)ppGpp hydrolase activity. BLAST searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. The construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. Four groups could be distinguished: With the exception of Neisseria and Bordetella (beta subdivision), the RelA and SpoT groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. Two Rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the Bacillus/Clostridium group were also identified. The SpoT proteins are related to the gram positive Rel proteins. RelA proteins carry substitutions in the HD domain (Aravind and Koonin, 1998, TIBS 23: 469-472) responsible for ppGpp degradation. A theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous relA and spoT genes is presented: After gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spoT and relA genes evolved from the duplicated genes. The distribution pattern of the paralogous RelA and SpoT proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (Gupta, 2000, FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 24: 367-402). This model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. However, two paralogous, closely related genes of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the RelA and SpoT proteins do not fit in this model. Completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia species, Rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont Buchnera sp. APS as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes but they are present in the Arabidopsis genome. In crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppGpp as crosslinking reagents and RNA polymerase preparations of Escherichia coli, binding of ppGpp to distinct regions at the C-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoB gene product) and/or at the N-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoC gene product) was observed previously. RpoB and RpoC sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppGpp binding regions.
TI  - Expression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase in human bile: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial beta-glucuronidase causes deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide resulting in the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate, which contributes to biliary sludge and stone formation. This process is attributed to enzyme activity produced by the aerobic enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. The presence of Clostridium sp. was detected in 48 of 56 intrahepatic stones by using polymerase chain reaction techniques and cultured Clostridium perfringens from 14 of 18 unblocked biliary stents. Such bacteria are reported to produce beta-glucuronidase activity. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of biliary bacteria isolated from pigment stones and stents that produce beta-glucuronidase and to compare the enzyme activity expressed by the different bacteria in human bile. METHODS: A total of 202 bacteria were isolated from blocked and unblocked biliary stents and pigment ductal stones recovered from patients. Of these, 61 bacteria expressed beta-glucuronidase activity in brain heart infusion broth. These 61 bacteria were subsequently grown in human bile under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to the early stationary phase and assayed for beta-glucuronidase activity by using rho-nitrophenyl beta-D glucuronide as substrate. Results were normalized and reported as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein of the bacteria. RESULTS: C. perfringens produced beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity that was 34-fold higher than that for E coli, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium sp., Bacillus sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp., Streptococcus sp., and Klebsiella sp. CONCLUSION: C. perfringens with its higher enzyme activity is more important in the deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide than E coli and Klebsiella sp.
TI  - Class II broad-spectrum mercury resistance transposons in Gram-positive bacteria  from natural environments.
AB  - We have studied the mechanisms of the horizontal dissemination of a broad-spectrum mercury resistance determinant among Bacillus and related species. This mer determinant was first described in Bacillus cereus RC607 from Boston Harbor, USA, and was then found in various Bacillus and related species in Japan, Russia and England. We have shown that the mer determinant can either be located at the chromosome, or on a plasmid in the Bacillus species, and is carried by class II mercury resistance transposons: Tn5084 from B. cereus RC607 and B. cereus VKM684 (ATCC10702) and Tn5085 from Exiguobacterium sp. TC38-2b. Tn5085 is identical in nucleotide sequence to TnMERI1, the only other known mer transposon from Bacillus species, but it does not contain an intron like TnMERI1. Tn5085 is functionally active in Escherichia coli. Tn5083, which we have isolated from B. megaterium MK64-1, contains an RC607-like mer determinant, that has lost some mercury resistance genes and possesses a merA gene which is a novel sequence variant that has not been previously described. Tn5083 and Tn5084 are recombinants, and are comprised of fragments from several transposons including Tn5085, and a relative of a putative transposon from B. firmus (which contains similar genes to the cadmium resistance operon of Staphylococcus aureus), as well as others. The sequence data showed evidence for recombination both between transposition genes and between mer determinants.
TI  - The N-terminal signal sequence and the last 98 amino acids are not essential for  the secretion of Bacillus sp. TS-23 alpha-amylase in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A truncated Bacillus sp. TS-23 alpha-amylase gene lacking 96 and 294 bp at its 5' and 3' end respectively was prepared by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into Escherichia coli expression vector, pQE-30, under the control of T5 promoter. SDS-PAGE and activity staining analyses showed that the His6-tagged amylase had a molecular mass of approximately 54 kDa. Isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction of E. coli M15 cells bearing the recombinant plasmid resulted in the extracellular production of active amylase. Western blot analysis also revealed that the truncated amylase was present in the periplasmic space and culture medium.
TI  - Structure and expression of an amylopullulanase gene from Bacillus stearothermophilus TS-23.
AB  - An amylopullulanase gene (apuTS) from Bacillus stearothermophilus TS-23 was cloned and characterized. apuTS consisted of an open reading frame of 6054 bp encoding a protein of 2018 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 223811. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed four highly conserved regions that are common among amylolytic enzymes. In the C-terminal region, a six-amino-acid sequence (Pro-Gly-Ser-Gly-Thr-Thr) is repeated nine times. It shared the highest degree of homology with the amylopullulanase of Bacillus sp. XAL601. The enzyme also had moderate homology with amylopullulanases from thermophilic anaerobic bacteria. Low levels of homology were observed between the ApuTS of B. stearothermophilus TS-23 and amylopullulanases of Pyrococcus abyssi Orsay, P. furiosus and Bacillus sp. KSM1378. When the intact coding region of apuTS was expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the lac promoter, the product was degenerate, as revealed by amylase activity staining after SDS/PAGE. The largest active polypeptide had an M(r) of about 220000, while the smallest one had an M(r) of about 105000. Upstream of the apuTS gene, a gene orfX was fortuitously cloned. The putative OrfX protein was weakly related to the myosin heavy chain. It was predicted to contain a central, 179-residue-long, coiled-coil domain.
TI  - Sequence analyses of a broad host-range plasmid containing ermT from a tylosin-resistant Lactobacillus sp. Isolated from swine feces.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria resistant to the macrolide antibiotics tylosin and erythromycin were isolated from the feces of swine. One of the strains, 121B, was initially identified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as an unknown Lactobacillus sp. The strain was found to contain at least two plasmids, one of which was capable of replicating and providing erythromycin and tylosin resistance to Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Escherichia coli. DNA sequence analyses of the 4,232-bp plasmid, p121BS, identified one open reading frame encoding a methylase gene highly similar (> 98% amino acid identity, > 99% DNA sequence identity) to the ermT gene from the Lactobacillus reuteri plasmid pGT633. This is only the second ermT gene to be reported. p121BS also contains two additional open reading frames with significant amino acid similarities to replication proteins from Lactobacillus and other Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Facilitation of bacteriophage lambda DNA injection by inner membrane proteins of  the bacterial phosphoenol-pyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS).
AB  - Infection of Escherichia coli by bacteriophage lambda depends on two membrane protein complexes: (i) maltoporin (LamB) in the outer membrane for adsorption and (ii) the IIC(Man)-IID(Man) complex of the mannose transporter in the inner membrane for DNA penetration. IIC(Man) and IID(Man) are components of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) which together with the IIAB(Man) subunit mediate transport and phosphorylation of sugars. To identify structural determinants important for penetration of lambda DNA, the homologous IIC-IID complexes of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and B. subtilis, and chimeric complexes between the IIC and IID were characterized. All three complexes support sugar transport in E. coli. Only IIC-IID of E. coli and B. subtilis also support bacteriophage lambda infection. The six chimeric complexes had lost transport activity, but three containing IIC of E. coli or B. subtilis continue to support bacteriophage lambda infection. Complexes containing IIC(Man) and fusion proteins between truncated IID(Man) and alkaline phosphatase or beta-galactosidase support penetration of lambda DNA if less than 100 residues are missing from the C-terminus of IID(Man). Truncation of IIC(Man) renders the complex unstable. Taken together, these results suggest, that IIC is the major specificity determinant for lambda infection but that the IIC subunit is stably expressed only in a complex with the IID subunit. Lambda DNA in transit across the periplasmic space, but not transforming plasmid DNA, is inaccessible to the non-specific nuclease NucA of Anabaena sp. targeted to the periplasmic space either in soluble form or as a fusion protein to the C-terminus of IID(Man).
TI  - Molecular cloning, DNA sequence, and expression of the gene encoding for thermostable pectate lyase of thermophilic Bacillus sp. TS 47.
AB  - The gene that encodes a thermostable pectate lyase (called PL 47), from Bacillus  sp. TS 47, was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in mesophilic B. subtilis. The gene contained an open reading frame consisting of 1326 bp, which encoded 441 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme (416 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47,262 Da), showed 52% similarity with PL (BsPel) from mesophilic B. subtilis SO113. The structure-based alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of PL 47 with that of BsPel suggested that PL 47 might have a parallel beta-helix structure with three long loops. The amino acids making up PL 47 are richer in hydrophobic amino acids and glutamic acid than BsPel. The hydropathy profile of PL 47 indicated that the amino acid sequences around putative calcium binding sites are more hydrophobic than the same region of BsPel. The gene product expressed in B. subtilis as the host was stable up to 70 degrees C and the reaction was optimal around 70 degrees C, as well as native PL 47.
TI  - rho is not essential for viability or virulence in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We have identified the gene for transcription termination factor Rho in Staphylococcus aureus. Deletion of rho in S. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. We also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of Rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. Exceptions include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, all of which appear not to possess a Rho homolog. Complementation studies indicate that S. aureus Rho possesses the same activity as Escherichia coli Rho and that the Rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against S. aureus Rho. Our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the aminoacylase-1 family. A new proposed signature for metalloexopeptidases.
AB  - The amino acid sequence analysis of the human and porcine aminoacylases-1, the carboxypeptidase S precursor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Corynebacterium glutamicum, the acetylornithine deacetylase from Escherichia coli and Dictyostelium discoideum and the carboxypeptidase G(2) precursor from Pseudomonas strain, using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and the Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST), allowed us to suggest that all these enzymes, which share common functional and biochemical features, belong to the same structural family. The three amino acid blocks which were found to be highly conserved, using the CLUSTAL W program, could be assigned to the catalytic active site, based on the general three-dimensional structure of the carboxypeptidase G(2) from the Pseudomonas strain precursor. Six additional proteins with the same signature have been retrieved after performing two successive PSI-BLAST iterations using the sequence of the conserved motif, namely Lactobacillus delbrueckii aminoacyl-histidine dipeptidase, Streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae aminopeptidase Y precursor, two Bacillus stearothermophilus N-carbamyl-L-amino acid amidohydrolases and Pseudomonas sp. hydantoin utilization protein C. The three conserved amino acid motifs corresponded to the following blocks: (i) [S, G, A]-H-x-D-x-V; (ii) G-x-x-D; and (iii) x-E-E. This new sequence signature is clearly different from that commonly reported in the literature for proteins belonging to the ArgE/DapE/CPG2/YscS family.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a multidomain endoglucanase from Paenibacillus sp BP-23: evaluation of its performance in pulp refining.
AB  - The gene celB encoding an endoglucanase from Paenibacillus sp. BP-23 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a 4161 bp DNA fragment containing the celB gene was determined, revealing an open reading frame of 2991 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 106,927 Da. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of endoglucanase B with known beta-glycanase sequences showed that the encoded enzyme is a modular protein and exhibits high homology to enzymes belonging to family 9 cellulases. The celB gene product synthesized in E. coli showed high activity on carboxymethyl cellulose and lichenan while low activity was found on Avicel. Activity was enhanced in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+ and showed its maximum at 53 degrees C and pH 5.5. The effect of the cloned enzyme in modifying the physical properties of pulp and paper from Eucalyptus was tested (CelB treatment). An increase in mechanical strength of paper and a decrease in pulp dewatering properties were found, indicating that CelB treatment can be considered as a biorefining. Treatment with CelB gave rise to an improvement in paper strength similar to that obtained with 1,000 revolutions increase in mechanical refining. Comparison with the performances of recently developed endoglucanase A from the same strain and with a commercial cellulase showed that CelB produced the highest refining effect.
TI  - Monoacylglycerol lipase from moderately thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain H-257: molecular cloning, sequencing, and expression in Escherichia coli of the gene.
AB  - Monoacylglycerol lipase [MGLP, EC 3.1.1.23] is produced intracellularly by the moderately thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain H-257. The gene encoding MGLP was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. A genomic library of Bacillus sp. strain H-257, prepared in the plasmid vector pACYC184, was screened with a 0.2-kbp DNA fragment amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide primers designed based on the amino acid sequence of a purified MGLP. The plasmid pMGLP31, identified by hybridization with the amplified DNA fragment, contained a 5.3-kbp insert from Bacillus sp. strain H-257 DNA. Sequence analysis of the MGLP gene revealed an open reading frame encoding MGLP consisting of 250 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 27.4 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of MGLP contained the consensus pentapeptide (-Gly-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Gly-), which is conserved among lipases, esterases, and serine proteases. The MGLP is homologous to a putative esterase/lipase from Streptomyces coelicolor (41.8% homology). When pMGLP31 was introduced into E. coli DH1, the transformants produced MGLP intracellularly as an active form to an approximately 13.8-fold greater extent than Bacillus sp. strain H-257. The purified recombinant MGLP was shown to be identical to the native enzyme in terms of chromatographic behavior, isoelectric point, and physicochemical and catalytic properties.
TI  - Microbiological survey of retail herbs and spices from Mexican markets.
AB  - In the present study, 304 samples of herbs and spices (garlic powder, cumin seeds, black pepper, oregano, and bay leaves) widely used in Mexico were analyzed for the presence of Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Escherichia coli, total and fecal coliforms, total mesophilic aerobic organisms, and fungi. Samples were nonpackaged or packaged in polyethylene bags or glass containers. High levels (10(5) to 10(7) CFU/g) of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms were found in most of the samples of garlic powder, cumin seed, and black pepper. Lower levels (<102 CFU/g) were found in oregano and bay leaves. Total and fecal coliforms counts were dependent on the type of packaging. More than 70% of the polyethylene-packaged samples had less than 10(3) CFU/g of microorganisms. Glass and nonpackaged spices showed lower levels of these microorganisms. B. cereus was present in 32 samples of which most were polyethylene packaged. The other pathogenic bacteria were not detected. Aspergillus niger was detected in 29% of the samples, Rhizopus sp. in 19%, and Penicillum sp. and Cunninghamella in 8%.
TI  - Bioactivity studies of extracts from Tridax procumbens.
AB  - An updated review on the biological activity of Tridax procumbens is presented. A detailed biological screening comprised of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi using crude extracts of this plant was undertaken. The n-hexane extract of the flowers showed activity against Escherichia coli. The same extract of the whole aerial parts was active against Mycobacterium smegmatis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella group C and Salmonella paratyphi. The ethyl-acetate extract of the flowers was active against Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella sp. The aerial parts extract also showed activity only against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Staphylococcus aureus, while the aqueous extract showed no antimicrobial activity. None of the tested extracts was active against the yeasts, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Rhodotorula rubra; or the fungi: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Mucor sp. and Trichophyton rubrum.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a bacterial cell-bound type B carboxylesterase from Bacillus sp. BP-7.
AB  - A clone producing halos on tributyrin plates was isolated from a genomic library  of Bacillus sp. BP-7. The insert contained an open reading frame that coded for a protein of 487 amino acids with homology to carboxylesterases. The cloned enzyme showed clear preference for esters of short-chain fatty acids, being classified as an esterase. Maximum activity was found at 45 degrees C and pH 7.5. The enzyme displayed stability in the pH range from 6 to 9.5, and at temperatures from 4 degrees to 45 degrees C. Zymogram analysis of the protein revealed a molecular mass of 53 kDa and a pI of 5.1. The enzyme showed homology to members of the bacterial subclass of type B carboxylesterases, a set of proteins potentially useful for biotechnological applications.
TI  - Antimicrobial and phytochemical studies on 45 Indian medicinal plants against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  - Ethanolic extracts of 45 Indian medicinal plants traditionally used in medicine were studied for their antimicrobial activity against certain drug-resistant bacteria and a yeast Candida albicans of clinical origin. Of these, 40 plant extracts showed varied levels of antimicrobial activity against one or more test bacteria. Anticandidal activity was detected in 24 plant extracts. Overall, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity was observed in 12 plants (L. inermis, Eucalyptus sp., H. antidysentrica, H. indicus, C. equistifolia. T. belerica, T. chebula, E. officinalis, C. sinensis, S. aromaticum and P. granatum). No correlation was observed between susceptibility of test strains with plant extracts and antibiotic resistance behaviour of the microbial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella dysenteriae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans). Qualitative phytochemical tests, thin layer chromatography and TLC-bioautography of certain active extracts demonstrated the presence of common phytocompounds in the plant extracts including phenols, tannins and flavonoids as major active constituents.
TI  - Cloning, sequences, and characterization of two chitinase genes from the Antarctic Arthrobacter sp. strain TAD20: isolation and partial characterization of the enzymes.
AB  - Arthrobacter sp. strain TAD20, a chitinolytic gram-positive organism, was isolated from the sea bottom along the Antarctic ice shell. Arthrobacter sp. strain TAD20 secretes two major chitinases, ChiA and ChiB (ArChiA and ArChiB), in response to chitin induction. A single chromosomal DNA fragment containing the genes coding for both chitinases was cloned in Escherichia coli. DNA sequencing analysis of this fragment revealed two contiguous open reading frames coding for the precursors of ArChiA (881 amino acids [aa]) and ArChiB (578 aa). ArChiA and ArChiB are modular enzymes consisting of a glycosyl-hydrolase family 18 catalytic domain as well as two and one chitin-binding domains, respectively. The catalytic domain of ArChiA exhibits 55% identity with a chitodextrinase from Vibrio furnissii. The ArChiB catalytic domain exhibits 33% identity with chitinase A of Bacillus circulans. The ArChiA chitin-binding domains are homologous to the chitin-binding domain of ArChiB. ArChiA and ArChiB were purified to homogeneity from the native Arthrobacter strain and partially characterized. Thermal unfolding of ArChiA, ArChiB, and chitinase A of Serratia marcescens was studied using differential scanning calorimetry. ArChiA and ArChiB, compared to their mesophilic counterpart, exhibited increased heat lability, similar to other cold-adapted enzymes.
TI  - Purification and characterization of PBP4a, a new low-molecular-weight penicillin-binding protein from Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Penicillin-binding protein 4a (PBP4a) from Bacillus subtilis was overproduced and purified to homogeneity. It clearly exhibits DD-carboxypeptidase and thiolesterase activities in vitro. Although highly isologous to the Actinomadura sp. strain R39 DD-peptidase (B. Granier, C. Duez, S. Lepage, S. Englebert, J. Dusart, O. Dideberg, J. van Beeumen, J. M. Frere, and J. M. Ghuysen, Biochem. J. 282:781-788, 1992), which is rapidly inactivated by many beta-lactams, PBP4a is only moderately sensitive to these compounds. The second-order rate constant (k(2)/K) for the acylation of the essential serine by benzylpenicillin is 300,000 M(-1) s(-1) for the Actinomadura sp. strain R39 peptidase, 1,400 M(-1) s(-1) for B. subtilis PBP4a, and 7,000 M(-1) s(-1) for Escherichia coli PBP4, the third member of this class of PBPs. Cephaloridine, however, efficiently inactivates PBP4a (k(2)/K = 46,000 M(-1) s(-1)). PBP4a is also much more thermostable than the R39 enzyme.
TI  - Polysaccharide lyase: molecular cloning, sequencing, and overexpression of the xanthan lyase gene of Bacillus sp. strain GL1.
AB  - When grown on xanthan as a carbon source, the bacterium Bacillus sp. strain GL1 produces extracellular xanthan lyase (75 kDa), catalyzing the first step of xanthan depolymerization (H. Nankai, W. Hashimoto, H. Miki, S. Kawai, and K. Murata, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:2520-2526, 1999). A gene for the lyase was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The gene contained an open reading frame consisting of 2,793 bp coding for a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 99,308. The polypeptide had a signal peptide (2 kDa) consisting of 25 amino acid residues preceding the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme and exhibited significant homology with hyaluronidase of Streptomyces griseus (identity score, 37.7%). Escherichia coli transformed with the gene without the signal peptide sequence showed a xanthan lyase activity and produced intracellularly a large amount of the enzyme (400 mg/liter of culture) with a molecular mass of 97 kDa. During storage at 4 degrees C, the purified enzyme (97 kDa) from E. coli was converted to a low-molecular-mass (75-kDa) enzyme with properties closely similar to those of the enzyme (75 kDa) from Bacillus sp. strain GL1, specifically in optimum pH and temperature for activity, substrate specificity, and mode of action. Logarithmically growing cells of Bacillus sp. strain GL1 on the medium with xanthan were also found to secrete not only xanthan lyase (75 kDa) but also a 97-kDa protein with the same N-terminal amino acid sequence as that of xanthan lyase (75 kDa). These results suggest that, in Bacillus sp. strain GL1, xanthan lyase is first synthesized as a preproform (99 kDa), secreted as a precursor (97 kDa) by a signal peptide-dependent mechanism, and then processed into a mature form (75 kDa) through excision of a C-terminal protein fragment with a molecular mass of 22 kDa.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the gene coding for azoreductase from Bacillus sp. OY1-2 isolated from soil.
AB  - Azo dyes are regarded as pollutants because they are not readily reduced under aerobic conditions. Bacillus sp. OY1-2 transforms azo dyes into colorless compounds, and this reduction is mediated by a reductase activity for the azo group in the presence of NADPH. A 1.2-kbp EcoRI fragment containing the gene that encodes azoreductase was cloned by screening the genomic library of Bacillus sp. OY1-2 with digoxigenin-labeled probe designed from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. An open reading frame encoding the azoreductase, consisting of 178 amino acids, was predicted from the nucleotide sequence. In addition, because only a Bacillus subtillis hypothetical protein was discovered in the public databases (with an amino acid identity of 52.8%), the gene encoding the azoreductase cloned in this study was predicted to be a member of a novel family of reductases. Southern blot analysis revealed that the azoreductase gene exists as a single copy gene on a chromosome. Escherichia coli-expressing recombinant azoreductase gave a ten times greater reducing activity toward azo dyes than the original Bacillus sp. OY1-2. In addition, the expressed azoreductase purified from the recombinant E. coli lysate by Red-Sepharose affinity chromatography showed a similar activity and specificity as the native enzyme. This is the first report describing the sequencing and characterization of a gene encoding the azo dye-reducing enzyme, azoreductase, from aerobic bacteria and its expression in E. coli.
TI  - Production and characterization of a new monoclonal antibody against Neisseria meningitidis: study of the cross-reactivity with different bacterial genera.
AB  - We have generated a hybridoma cell line which produces an 8C7Br1 clone of the IgM antibody isotype. It recognizes the 50-, 65-, and 60-kDa antigens and is reactive with strains of N. meningitidis in the 98% of local Neisseria genera by Dot-ELISA assays. Two percent of the strains of N. meningitidis B do not present reactivity with the 8C7Br1 monoclonal antibody (MAb). The antibody reacted against N. meningitidis of serogroups A, B, C, X, Y, Z, and different serotypes and subtypes of N. meningitidis B and C by means of Dot-ELISA and Immunoblot. It cross-reacted with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria lactamica, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Bordetella pertussis, and Bacillus subtilis. The 8C7Br1 MAb reacted with the 65-kDa protein present in the prototype meningococcal strains B:16:B6(B2a:P1.5.2) and 2996 (B2b:P1.5.2). In H. influenzae type b, E. coli and B. subtilis, the MAb recognized the protein of 60, 65, and 70 kDa, respectively. FACS analysis showed that 8C7Brl MAb could recognize the 50-kDa protein on the surface of N. meningitidis homologous (B:4:P1.9) strain. These results, together with the bactericidal activity of 8C7Br1, and an experiment of passive protection in mice, demonstrated the potential importance of the cross-reactive protein as a candidate antigen for N. meningitidis B vaccine composition.
TI  - Temporal secretion of a multicellulolytic system in Myxobacter sp. AL-1. Molecular cloning and heterologous expression of cel9 encoding a modular endocellulase clustered in an operon with cel48, an exocellobiohydrolase gene.
AB  - The Gram-negative soil micro-organism Myxobacter sp. AL-1 possesses at least five extracellular cellulases, the production of which is regulated by the growth cycle. We cloned the complete gene for one of these cellulases, termed cel9, which encoded a 67-kDa modular family 9 endoglycohydrolase, which was produced during the stationary phase of growth and was strongly enhanced by avicel. The predicted product of cel9 matches the structural architecture of family 9 cellulases such as Thermonospora fusca endo/exocellulase E4. Cel9 protein was synthesized in Escherichia coli from a multicopy plasmid and in Bacillus subtilis from the isopropyl thiogalactoside-inducible Pspac promoter and was purified from the culture medium. Thermal stability, optimum pH and temperature dependence of Cel9 were similar when expressed from either source, and were indistinguishable from related cellulases produced by thermophilic bacteria. Downstream from cel9 was found a partial ORF, designated cel48, the deduced product of which was highly similar to bacterial exocellobiohydrolases and processive endoglucanases belonging to family 48 of the glycosyl hydrolases. The cel9 and cel48 genes appear to be arranged as part of an operon.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Nostocyclyne A, a novel antimicrobial cyclophane from the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp.
AB  - A novel acetylene-containing para-[14]-cyclophane, nostocyclyne A (1), possessing antimicrobial activity, is the major active metabolite of the natural bloom of the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. (TAU strain IL-220). Homonuclear and heteronuclear 2D NMR techniques as well as HREIMS determined the gross structure of 1.
TI  - Genomic Analysis of the Genes Encoding Ribosomal Proteins in Eight Eubacterial Species and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - The complete genomic nucleotide sequence data of more than 10 unicellular organisms have become available. During the past years, we have been focusing our attention to the analysis of the structure and function of the ribosome and its protein components. By making use of the genomic sequence data, our work can now be extended to comparative analysis of the ribosomal components at the genomic level. Such analysis will contribute to our understanding of the structure-function relationship of the ribosome that is vital to the expression of genetic information. Bearing these in mind, the ribosomal protein genes of organisms whose genomic sequence data are available were analyzed, which included Aquifex aeolicus; Archaeoglobus fulgidus; Borrelia burgdorferi; Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Haemophilus influenzae; Helicobacter pylori; Methanococcus jannaschii; Mycoplasma genitalium; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Synechosystis sp., and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, the amino acid sequence data of Bacillus stearothermophilus ribosomal proteins were used in the evolutionary evaluation. The results indicate that, in eubacteria including two species of Mycoplasma, the operon structure of ribosomal protein genes is well conserved, while their relative orientation and chromosomal location are diverged into several classes. The operon structure in M. jannaschii on the other hand is quite different from the eubacterial one and we noticed that its many genes show similarity to rat ribosomal protein genes. The degrees of sequence conservation differ from one ribosomal protein gene to another, but several genes encoding proteins that are considered to be of structural importance are conserved throughout the bacterial species including archaebacteria and further in S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Phenol/cresol degradation by the thermophilic Bacillus thermoglucosidasius A7: cloning and sequence analysis of five genes involved in the pathway.
AB  - Bacillus thermoglucosidasius A7 degraded phenol at 65 degrees C via the meta cleavage pathway. Five enzymes used in the metabolism of phenol were cloned from B. thermoglucosidasius A7 into pUC18. Nine open reading frames were present on the 8.1kb insert, six of which could be assigned a function in phenol degradation using database homologies and enzyme activities. The phenol hydroxylase is a two-component enzyme encoded by pheA1 and pheA2. The larger component (50kDa) has 49% amino acid identity with the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase of Escherichia coli, while the smaller component (19kDa) is most related (30% amino acid identity) to the styrene monoxygenase component B from Pseudomonas fluorescens. Both components were neccessary for activity. The catechol 2, 3-dioxygenase encoded by pheB has 45% amino acid identity with dmpB of Pseudomonas sp. CF600 and could be assigned to superfamily I, family 2 and a new subfamily of the Eltis and Bolin grouping. The 2-hydroxymuconic acid semialdehyde hydrolase (2HMSH), encoded by pheC, revealed the highest amino acid identity (36%) to the equivalent enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. strain CF600, encoded by dmpD. Based on sequence identity, pheD and pheE were deduced to encode the 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate hydratase (2HDH), demonstrating 45% amino acid identity to the gene product of cumE from Pseudomonas fluorescens and the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) demonstrating 57% amino acid identity to the gene product of bphJ from Pseudomonas LB400.
TI  - Spore photoproduct (SP) lyase from Bacillus subtilis specifically binds to and cleaves SP (5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine) but not cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in UV-irradiated DNA.
AB  - The predominant photolesion in the DNA of UV-irradiated dormant bacterial spores  is the thymine dimer 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine, commonly referred to as spore photoproduct (SP). A major determinant of SP repair during spore germination is its direct reversal by the enzyme SP lyase, encoded by the splB gene in Bacillus subtilis. SplB protein containing an N-terminal tag of six histidine residues [(6His)SplB] was purified from dormant B. subtilis spores and shown to efficiently cleave SP but not cyclobutane cis,syn thymine-thymine dimers in vitro. In contrast, SplB protein containing an N-terminal 10-histidine tag [(10His)SplB] purified from an Escherichia coli overexpression system was incompetent to cleave SP unless the 10-His tag was first removed by proteolysis at an engineered factor Xa site. To assay the parameters of binding of SplB protein to UV-damaged DNA, a 35-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide was constructed which carried a single pair of adjacent thymines on one strand. Irradiation of the oligonucleotide in aqueous solution or at 10% relative humidity resulted in formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (Py lozengePy) or SP, respectively. (10His)SplB was assayed for oligonucleotide binding using a DNase I protection assay. In the presence of (10His)SplB, the SP-containing oligonucleotide was selectively protected from DNase I digestion (half-life, >60 min), while the Py lozengePy-containing oligonucleotide and the unirradiated oligonucleotide were rapidly digested by DNase I (half-lives, 6 and 9 min, respectively). DNase I footprinting of (10His)SplB bound to the artificial substrate was carried out utilizing the (32)P end-labeled 35-bp oligonucleotide containing SP. DNase I footprinting showed that SplB protected at least a 9-bp region surrounding SP from digestion with DNase I with the exception of two DNase I-hypersensitive sites within the protected region. (10His)SplB also caused significant enhancement of DNase I digestion of the SP-containing oligonucleotide for at least a full helical turn 3' to the protected region. The data suggest that binding of SP lyase to SP causes significant bending or distortion of the DNA helix in the vicinity of the lesion.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the nitrile hydratase and amidase genes from Bacillus sp. BR449 into Escherichia coli.
AB  - A moderate thermophile, Bacillus sp. BR449 was previously shown to exhibit a high level of nitrile hydratase (NHase) activity when growing on high levels of acrylonitrile at 55 degrees C. In this report, we describe the cloning of a 6.1 kb SalI DNA fragment encoding the NHase gene cluster of BR449 into Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequencing revealed six ORFs encoding (in order), two unidentified putative proteins, amidase, NHase beta- and alpha-subunits and a small putative protein of 101 amino acids designated P12K. Spacings and orientation of the coding regions as well as their gene expression in E. coli suggest that the beta-subunit, alpha-subunit, and P12K genes are co-transcribed. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicate that the amidase (348 aa, MW 38.6 kDa) belongs to the nitrilase-related aliphatic amidase family, and that the NHase beta- (229 aa, MW 26.5 kDa) and alpha- (214 aa, MW 24.5 kDa) subunits comprise a cobalt-containing member of the NHase family, which includes Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 and Pseudomonas putida 5B NHases. The amidase/NHase gene cluster differs both in arrangement and composition from those described for other NHase-producing strains. When expressed in Escherichia coli DH5alpha, the subcloned NHase genes produced significant levels of active NHase enzyme when cobalt ion was added either to the culture medium or cell extracts. Presence of the P12K gene and addition of amide compounds as inducers were not required for this expression.
TI  - [Genetic control of the biotransformation of plant terpenoids by Pseudomonas strain SP.1K1].
AB  - Bacterial strain Pseudomonas sp. 1K1 can grow on sesquiterpene lactones isolated  from medicinal plants of Kazakhstan due to 18-kb conjugative plasmid. This plasmid is stable in heterologous environment (E. coli and B. subtilis), which was proven by transformation transfer. The possibility of using salicylate as p1K1 selective agent has been demonstrated.
TI  - Subsite preferences of pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinases from prokaryotes: kumamolysin, a thermostable pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinase.
AB  - Kumamolysin, a carboxyl proteinase from Bacillus novosp. MN-32, is characterized  by its thermostability and insensitivity to aspartic proteinase inhibitors such as pepstatin, diazoacetyl-DL-norleucine methylester, and 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitro-phenoxy)propane. Here, its substrate specificity was elucidated using two series of synthetic chromogenic substrates: P(5)-P(4)-P(3)-P(2)-Phe*Nph (p-nitrophenylalanine: *cleavage site)-P(2)'-P(3)', in which the amino acid residues at the P(5)-P(2), P(2)' and P(3)' positions were systematically substituted. Among 74 substrates, kumamolysin was shown to hydrolyze Lys-Pro-Ile-Pro-Phe-Nph-Arg-Leu most effectively. The kinetic parameters of this peptide were K(m) = 41+/-5 microM, k(cat) = 176+/- 10 s(-1), and k(cat)/K(m) = 4.3+/-0.6 mM(-1) x s(-1). These systematic analyses revealed the following features: (i) Kumamolysin had a unique preference for the P(2) position. Kumamolysin preferentially hydrolyzed peptides having an Ala or Pro residue at the P(2) position; this was also observed for the pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinase from Bacillus coagulans J-4 [J-4; Shibata et al. (1998) J. Biochem. 124, 642-647]. Other carboxyl proteinases, including Pseudomonas sp. 101 pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinase (PCP) and Xanthomonas sp. T-22 pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinase (XCP), preferred peptides having hydrophobic and bulky amino acid residue such as Leu at the P(2) position. (ii) Kumamolysin preferred such charged amino acid residues as Glu or Arg at the P(2)' position, suggesting that the S(2)' subsite of kumamolysin is occupied by hydrophilic residues, similar to that of PCP, XCP, and J-4. In general, the S(2)' subsite of pepstatin-sensitive carboxyl proteinases (aspartic proteinases) is hydrophobic in nature. Thus, the hydrophilic nature of the S(2)' subsite was confirmed to be a distinguishing feature of pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinases from prokaryotes.
TI  - Efficient secretory production of alkaline phosphatase by high cell density culture of recombinant Escherichia coli using the Bacillus sp. endoxylanase signal sequence.
AB  - New secretion vectors containing the Bacillus sp. endoxylanase signal sequence were constructed for the secretory production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. The E. coli alkaline phosphatase structural gene fused to the endoxylanase signal sequence was expressed from the trc promoter in various E. coli strains by induction with IPTG. Among those tested, E. coli HB101 showed the highest efficiency of secretion (up to 25.3% of total proteins). When cells were induced with 1 mM IPTG, most of the secreted alkaline phosphatase formed inclusion bodies in the periplasm. However, alkaline phosphatase could be produced as a soluble form without reduction of expression level by inducing with less (0.01 mM) IPTG, and greater than 90% of alkaline phosphatase could be recovered from the periplasm by the simple osmotic shock method. Fed-batch cultures were carried out to examine the possibility of secretory protein production at high cell density. Up to 5.2 g/l soluble alkaline phosphatase could be produced in the periplasm by the pH-stat fed-batch cultivation of E. coli HB101 harboring pTrcS1PhoA. These results demonstrate the possibility of efficient secretory production of recombinant proteins in E. coli by high cell density cultivation.
TI  - estA, a gene coding for a cell-bound esterase from Paenibacillus sp. BP-23, is a  new member of the bacterial subclass of type B carboxylesterases.
AB  - Screening of a gene library from Paenibacillus sp. BP-23 generated in Escherichia coli led to identification of a clone that directed the production of lipolytic activity. From the sequencing data, we found an open reading frame encoding a protein of 485 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 53 kDa and a pI of 5.1. Absence of a signal peptide indicated that it was a cell-bound protein. Sequence analysis showed that the protein contained the signature G-XI-S-X2-G included in most serine-esterases and lipases. The cloned protein showed high homology with enzymes belonging to the bacterial subclass of type B carboxylesterases. The enzyme had a significant preference for esters of short-chain fatty acids and showed the kinetics behaviour of a true esterase. Maximum activity was found at pH 7.5 and 37 degrees C, although the enzyme was active in the pH range 6.0- 9.0 and at temperatures up to 45 degrees C. As expected for a serine-esterase, activity was inhibited by phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride.
TI  - ComP, a pilin-like protein essential for natural competence in Acinetobacter sp.  Strain BD413: regulation, modification, and cellular localization.
AB  - We recently identified a pilin-like competence factor, ComP, which is essential for natural transformation of the gram-negative soil bacterium Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413. Here we demonstrate that transcription and synthesis of the pilin-like competence factor ComP are maximal in the late stationary growth phase, whereas competence is induced immediately after inoculation of a stationary-phase culture into fresh medium. Western blot analyses revealed three forms of ComP, one with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa, which correlates with the molecular mass deduced from the DNA sequence, one 20-kDa form, which was found to be glycosylated, and one 23-kDa form. The glycosylation of ComP was not required for its function in DNA binding and uptake. The 20-kDa form was present in the cytoplasmic membrane, the periplasm, and the outer membrane, whereas the 23-kDa form was located in the outer membrane and might be due to a further modification. Immunological data suggest that ComP is not a subunit of the pilus structures. Possible functions of ComP in the DNA transformation machinery of Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413 are discussed.
TI  - Cry1Ac protoxin from Bacillus thuringiensis sp. kurstaki HD73 binds to surface proteins in the mouse small intestine.
AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), considered a safe insecticide, produces insecticidal proteins named Cry during sporulation, which possess exceptional immunological properties. In this work using an immunohistochemical test we demonstrated that Cry1Ac protoxin (pCry1Ac) binds to the mucosal surface of the mouse small intestine. Ligand blot assay allowed us to detect, under denaturing conditions, six pCry1Ac-binding polypeptides present in brush border membrane vesicles isolated from the small intestine. Moreover, this protein induced in situ temporal changes in the electrophysiological properties of the mouse jejunum. The data obtained indicate a possible interaction in vivo of Cry proteins with the animal bowel which could induce changes in the physiological status of the intestine.
TI  - comB, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of Acinetobacter sp. BD413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  - Here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging ORFs in Acinetobacter sp.  BD413, namely lytB, orfY, orfX, comB, and orfZ, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comC. The N-termini of the deduced proteins OrfY and ComB exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein ComB is similar to type IV pilins. LytB is similar to the Escherichia coli LytB, which has been implicated in the stringent response. No homologues of OrfX, OrfY and OrfZ could be identified. A mutation in orfY or orfZ led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comB resulted in a non-competent phenotype. Disruption of lytB did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. Complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comB is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfY and orfZ mutants were due to polar effects on comB and comC, respectively. Analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comB mutant suggested that the competence gene comB is not essential for the biogenesis of type IV pili and expression of the type IV pili-associated property of twitching motility. Transcriptional fusions between comB and a promoter-free lacZ gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comB during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Operon structure and functional analysis of the genes encoding thermophilic desulfurizing enzymes of Paenibacillus sp. A11-2.
AB  - Paenibacillus A11-2 can efficiently cleave two carbon&bond;sulfur bonds in dibenzothiophene (DBT) and alkyl DBTs, which are refractory by conventional petroleum hydrodesulfurization, to remove sulfur atom at high temperatures. An 8.7-kb DNA fragment containing the genes for the DBT desulfurizing enzymes of A11-2 was cloned in Escherichia coli and characterized. Heterologous expression analysis of the deletion mutants identified three open reading frames that were required for the desulfurization of DBT to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP). The three genes were designated tdsA, tdsB, and tdsC (for thermophilic desulfurization). Both the nucleotide sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences show significant homology to dszABC genes of Rhodococcus sp. IGTS8, but there are several local differences between them. Subclone analysis revealed that the product of tdsC oxidizes DBT to DBT-5,5'-dioxide via DBT-5-oxide, the product of tdsA converts DBT-5,5'-dioxide to 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzene sulfinate, and the product of tdsB converts 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzene sulfinate to 2-HBP. Cell-free extracts of a recombinant E. coli harboring all the three desulfurization genes converted DBT to 2-HBP at both 37 and 50 degrees C. In vivo and in vitro exhibition of desulfurization activity of the recombinant genes derived from a Paenibacillus indicates that an E. coli oxidoreductase can be functionally coupled with the monooxygenases of a gram-positive thermophile.
TI  - The role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  - The use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. Probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. There is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. However, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. Currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. However, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Bacteroides sp., Bacillus sp., Propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. Some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. Probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including Clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea caused by rotavirus, Shigella, Salmonella, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, Helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. Probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. There are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. Probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.
TI  - Polypurine.polypyrimidine sequences in complete bacterial genomes: preference for polypurines in protein-coding regions.
AB  - The genomes of Methanococcus jannaschii, Mycoplasma genitalium, Haemophilus influenzae, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Helicobacter pylori, Treponema pallidum, Borrelia burgdorferri, Rickettsia prowazekeii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Bacillus subtilis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Aquifex aeolicus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Escherichia coli have been analysed for the presence of polypurine.polypyrimidine tracts, in order to understand their distribution in these genomes. We observed a variation in abundance of such sequences in these bacteria, with the archaeal genomes forming a high-abundance group and the canonical eubacteria forming a low-abundance group. The genomes of M. tuberculosis and A. aeolicus are unique among the organisms analysed here in the abnormal underrepresentation and overrepresentation of polypurine.polypyrimidine, respectively. We also observe a strand bias, i.e., a preferential occurrence of polypurines in coding strands. It varies widely among the bacteria, from the very high bias in M. jannaschii to the slightly inverse bias in the parasitic genomes of T. pallidum and C. trachomatis. The extent of strand bias, however, cannot be explained on the basis of the GC-content of the genome, use of all-purine codons or an excess in the amino acids that are encoded by such codons. The probable causes and effects of this phenomenon are discussed.
TI  - Cloning and over-expression of thermostable Bacillus sp. YM55-1 aspartase and site-directed mutagenesis for probing a catalytic residue.
AB  - A thermostable aspartase gene (aspB) from Bacillus sp. YM55-1 was cloned and the  gene sequenced. The aspB gene (1407 bp ORF) encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 51 627 Da, consisting of 468 amino-acid residues. An amino-acid sequence comparison revealed that Bacillus YM55-1 aspartase shared 71% homology with Bacillus subtilis aspartase and 49% with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens aspartases. The E. coli TK237/pUCASPB strain, which was obtained by transforming E. coli TK237 (aspartase-null strain) with a vector plasmid (pUCASPB) containing the cloned aspB gene, produced a large amount of the enzyme corresponding to > 10% of the total soluble protein. The over-expressed recombinant enzyme (native molecular mass: 200 kDa) was purified effectively and rapidly using heat treatment and affinity chromatography. In order to probe the catalytic residues of this enzyme, two conserved amino-acid residues, Lys183 and His134, were individually mutated to alanine. Although the tertiary structure of each mutant was estimated to be the same as that of wild-type aspartase in CD and fluorescence measurements, the Lys183Ala mutant lost its activity completely, whereas His134Ala retained full activity. This finding suggests that Lys183 may be involved in the catalytic activity of this thermostable Bacillus YM55-1 aspartase.
TI  - An unusual pectate lyase from a Bacillus sp. with high activity on pectin: cloning and characterization.
AB  - The gene pelA encoding a pectate lyase from the strain Bacillus sp. BP-23 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a 1214 bp DNA fragment containing pelA gene was determined, revealing an ORF of 666 nucleotides that encoded a protein of 23233 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded enzyme showed homology to pectate lyases A, B, C and D from Fusarium solani, Pel-3 and PelB from Erwinia carotovora and Pell from Erwinia chrysanthemi. Homology was also found to the protein deduced from the Bacillus subtilis yvpA gene, the function of which is unknown. The heterologous expressed enzyme depolymerized polygalacturonate and pectins of methyl esterification degree from 22 to 89%, and exhibited similar activity on polygalacturonate and on 89% esterified citrus pectin. Optimum temperature and pH for enzymic activity were 50 degrees C and pH 10, respectively. Ca2+ was required for activity on pectic substrates, while the enzyme was strongly inhibited by Ba2+.
TI  - Novel heme-containing lyase, phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase from Bacillus sp. strain OxB-1: purification, characterization, and molecular cloning of the gene.
AB  - A novel dehydratase that catalyzes the stoichiometric dehydration of Z-phenylacetaldoxime to phenylacetonitrile has been purified 483-fold to homogeneity from a cell-free extract of Bacillus sp. strain OxB-1 isolated from soil. It has a M(r) of about 40 000 and is composed of a single polypeptide chain with a loosely bound protoheme IX. The enzyme is inactive unless FMN is added to the assay, but low activity is also observed when sulfite replaces FMN. The activity in the presence of FMN is enhanced 5-fold under anaerobic conditions compared to the activity measured in air. The enzyme has maximum activity at pH 7.0 and 30 degrees C, and it is stable at up to 45 degrees C at around neutral pH. The aerobically measured activity in the presence of FMN is also enhanced by Fe(2+), Sn(2+), SO(3)(2)(-), and NaN(3). Metal-chelating reagents, carbonyl reagents, electron donors, and ferri- and ferrocyanides strongly inhibit the enzyme with K(i) values in the micromolar range. The enzyme is active with arylalkylaldoximes and to a lesser extent with alkylaldoximes. The enzyme prefers the Z-form of phenylacetaldoxime over its E-isomer. On the basis of its substrate specificity, the enzyme has been tentatively named phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase. The gene coding for the enzyme was cloned into plasmid pUC18, and a 1053 base-pair open reading frame that codes for 351 amino acid residues was identified as the oxd gene. A nitrilase, which participates in aldoxime metabolism in the organism, was found to be coded by the region just upstream from the oxd gene. In addition an open reading frame (orf2), whose gene product is similar to bacterial regulatory (DNA-binding) proteins, was found just upstream from the coding region of the nitrilase. These findings provide genetic evidence for a novel gene cluster that is responsible for aldoxime metabolism in this microorganism.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Orobanche cernua extract.
AB  - The effect of the parasitic plant Orobanche cernua extract was evaluated on 5 different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Dilution experiments show that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; microgram/ml) of the extract was as follows: Staphylococcus aureus-1526.5; Streptococcus sp.-3125; Streptococcus pyogenes-25,000 and both for Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli-50,000 micrograms/ml. Data indicated that the MIC of 3125 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) and tobromycin (10 micrograms) activity against Streptococcus sp. and S. aureus, respectively; 25,000 and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) activity against S. pyogenes and B. cereus, respectively, and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to nalidixic acid (30 micrograms) activity against E. coli. It can be concluded that the O. cernua extract displays remarkable activity against some Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus.
TI  - Secretory production of human leptin in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Human leptin is a 16 kDa (146 amino acids) protein secreted from adipocytes and influences body weight homeostasis. In this study, human leptin was produced and secreted efficiently in Escherichia coli using a novel Bacillus sp. endoxylanase signal peptide. The endoxylanase signal sequence consisted of 28 amino acids (84 bp) was fused to the leptin structural gene. The fused gene was expressed using an inducible promoter (T7 or Trc) by adding 1 mM IPTG. Using T7 promoter in E. coli BL21(DE3), most of protein produced was in a premature form. Using the Trc promoter, which is weaker than T7, leptin was efficiently produced and secreted as a mature form (40% of total proteins) at 37 degrees C. However, most of leptin (about 90%) formed the inclusion bodies in the periplasmic space of E. coli. At 30 degrees C, ca. 90% of leptin was produced in a soluble form, but the total amount of leptin produced was 40% less than that obtained at 37 degrees C. When the periplasmic oxidoreductase of E. coli, DsbA, was co-expressed, 69% of the secreted leptin (26% of total proteins) was produced as soluble form at 37 degrees C without the decrease of the amount of leptin produced.
TI  - Kinetics and inhibition of cyclomaltodextrinase from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. I-5.
AB  - The cyclomaltodextrinase from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. I-5 (CDase I-5) was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified enzyme was used for characterization of the enzyme action. The hydrolysis products were monitored by both HPLC and high-performance ion chromatography analysis that enable the kinetic analysis of the cyclomaltodextrin (CD)-degrading reaction. Analysis of the kinetics of cyclomaltodextrin hydrolysis by CDase I-5 indicated that ring-opening of the cyclomaltodextrin was the major limiting step and that CDase I-5 preferentially degraded the linear maltodextrin chain by removing the maltose unit. The substrate binding affinity of the enzyme was almost same for those of cyclomaltodextrins while the rate of ring-opening was the fastest for cyclomaltoheptaose. Acarbose and methyl 6-amino-6-deoxy-alpha-d-glucopyranoside were relatively strong competitive inhibitors with K(i) values of 1.24 x 10(-3) and 8.44 x 10(-1) mM, respectively. Both inhibitors are likely to inhibit the ring-opening step of the CD degradation reaction.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activity of extracts from arrabidaea bilabiata.
AB  - Consumption of Arrabidaea bilabiata fresh leaves produces a paraplegic syndrome in cattle. For isolation of the active principle, isopropanol and methanol extracts were prepared from the aerial parts of the plant; these were administered to Sprague-Dawley rats at doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg, orally, to determine the presence of substances affecting spontaneous motor activity. The isopropanol extract produced significant increases of long-pause and short-pause movements (112 and 54%, respectively). The methanol extract tended to increase motor activity, but the effect did not reach statistical significance. Chemical and spectroscopic analysis of the isopropanol extract showed allantoin was the major constituent. It was administered to rats, at doses of 1.2, 12, and 120 mg/kg. A complex dose-response curve was observed, but at the highest dose, there was a 52% increase in the number of long-pause movements. It was inferred that allantoin and the constituents of the alcholic extracts might not be responsible for the paraplegic synndrome in cattle. The alteration of cattle motor activity could be caused by other non-alcoholic constituents. Additionally, extracts were assayed for in vitro activity against Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumonae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus sp. and Candida albicans . All microbial strains were found to be resistant to the extracts with the exception of C. albicans , suggesting a possible antifungal activity.
TI  - Calcium-mediated thermostability in the subtilisin superfamily: the crystal structure of Bacillus Ak.1 protease at 1.8 A resolution.
AB  - Proteins of the subtilisin superfamily (subtilases) are widely distributed through many living species, where they perform a variety of processing functions. They are also used extensively in industry. In many of these enzymes, bound calcium ions play a key role in protecting against autolysis and thermal denaturation. We have determined the crystal structure of a highly thermostable protease from Bacillus sp. Ak.1 that is strongly stabilized by calcium. The crystal structure, determined at 1.8 A resolution (R=0. 182, Rfree=0.247), reveals the presence of four bound cations, three Ca(2+) and one Na(+). Two of the Ca(2+) binding sites, Ca-1 and Ca-2, correspond to sites also found in thermitase and the mesophilic subtilisins. The third calcium ion, however, is at a novel site that is created by two key amino acid substitutions near Ca-1, and has not been observed in any other subtilase. This site, acting cooperatively with Ca-1, appears to give substantially enhanced thermostability, compared with thermitase. Comparisons with the mesophilic subtilisins also point to the importance of aromatic clusters, reduced hydrophobic surface and constrained N and C termini in enhancing the thermostability of thermitase and Ak.1 protease. The Ak.1 protease also contains an unusual Cys-X-Cys disulfide bridge that modifies the active site cleft geometry.
TI  - Studies of codon usage and tRNA genes of 18 unicellular organisms and quantification of Bacillus subtilis tRNAs: gene expression level and species-specific diversity of codon usage based on multivariate analysis.
AB  - We examined codon usage in Bacillus subtilis genes by multivariate analysis, quantified its cellular levels of individual tRNAs, and found a clear constraint of tRNA contents on synonymous codon choice. Individual tRNA levels were proportional to the copy number of the respective tRNA genes. This indicates that the tRNA gene copy number is an important factor to determine in cellular tRNA levels, which is common with Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Codon usage in 18 unicellular organisms whose genomes have been sequenced completely was analyzed and compared with the composition of tRNA genes. The 18 organisms are as follows: yeast S. cerevisiae, Aquifex aeolicus, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, B. subtilis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacterpylori, Methanococcusjannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Rickettsia prowazekii, Synechocystis sp., and Treponema pallidum. Codons preferred in highly expressed genes were related to the codons optimal for the translation process, which were predicted by the composition of isoaccepting tRNA genes. Genes with specific codon usage are discussed in connection with their evolutionary origins and functions. The origin and terminus of replication could be predicted on the basis of codon usage when the usage was analyzed relative to the transcription direction of individual genes.
TI  - Porcine pulmonary surfactant preparations contain the antibacterial peptide prophenin and a C-terminal 18-residue fragment thereof.
AB  - Surfactant preparations obtained from porcine lungs by extraction with chloroform/methanol followed by chromatography over Lipidex-5000 are used for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. These preparations contain about 98% phospholipids and 1-2% of the hydrophobic pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins B and C (SP-B and SP-C). Separation of the proteins in the surfactant preparation by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography revealed, in addition to SP-B and SP-C, the presence of three peptides derived from the cathelicidin family of antibacterial peptides. The 79-residue proline-rich peptide prophenin (identical to that isolated from leukocytes), an 80-residue prophenin with an N-terminal pyroglutamic acid residue, and a C-terminal 18-residue fragment of prophenin were found in approximate molar ratios of 1:20:5. A synthetic version of the C-terminal 18-residue peptide exhibits salt-dependent antibacterial activity (higher activity in the absence of salt) against the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium Bm11 and, to a lesser extent, against Gram-negative Escherichia coli D21 cells. It appears possible that the presence of prophenin peptides may contribute to the antibacterial properties of surfactant preparations.
TI  - Cold-adapted alanine dehydrogenases from two antarctic bacterial strains: gene cloning, protein characterization, and comparison with mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts.
AB  - The genes encoding NAD(+)-dependent alanine dehydrogenases (AlaDHs) (EC 1.4.1.1)  from the Antarctic bacterial organisms Shewanella sp. strain Ac10 (SheAlaDH) and Carnobacterium sp. strain St2 (CarAlaDH) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Of all of the AlaDHs that have been sequenced, SheAlaDH exhibited the highest level of sequence similarity to the AlaDH from the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio proteolyticus (VprAlaDH). CarAlaDH was most similar to AlaDHs from mesophilic and thermophilic Bacillus strains. SheAlaDH and CarAlaDH had features typical of cold-adapted enzymes; both the optimal temperature for catalytic activity and the temperature limit for retaining thermostability were lower than the values obtained for the mesophilic counterparts. The k(cat)/K(m) value for the SheAlaDH reaction was about three times higher than the k(cat)/K(m) value for VprAlaDH, but it was much lower than the k(cat)/K(m) value for the AlaDH from Bacillus subtilis. Homology-based structural models of various AlaDHs, including the two psychotropic AlaDHs, were constructed. The thermal instability of SheAlaDH and CarAlaDH may result from relatively low numbers of salt bridges in these proteins.
TI  - A multidomain xylanase from a Bacillus sp. with a region homologous to thermostabilizing domains of thermophilic enzymes.
AB  - The gene xynC encoding xylanase C from Bacillus sp. BP-23 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a 3538 bp DNA fragment containing xynC gene was determined, revealing an open reading frame of 3258 bp that encodes a protein of 120,567 Da. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of xylanase C with known beta-glycanase sequences showed that the encoded enzyme is a modular protein containing three different domains. The central region of the enzyme is the catalytic domain, which shows high homology to family 10 xylanases. A domain homologous to family IX cellulose-binding domains is located in the C-terminal region of xylanase C, whilst the N-terminal region of the enzyme shows homology to thermostabilizing domains found in several thermophilic enzymes. Xylanase C showed an activity profile similar to that of enzymes from mesophilic micro-organisms. Maximum activity was found at 45 degrees C, and the enzyme was only stable at 55 degrees C lower temperatures. Xylotetraose, xylotriose, xylobiose and xylose were the main products from birchwood xylan hydrolysis, whilst the enzyme showed increasing activity on xylo-oligosaccharides of increasing length, indicating that the cloned enzyme is an endoxylanase. A deletion derivative of xylanase C, lacking the region homologous to thermostabilizing domains, was constructed. The truncated enzyme showed a lower optimum temperature for activity than the full-length enzyme, 35 degrees C instead of 45 degrees C, and a reduced thermal stability that resulted in a complete inactivation of the enzyme after 2 h incubation at 55 degrees C.
TI  - The icfG gene cluster of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 encodes an Rsb/Spo-like protein kinase, protein phosphatase, and two phosphoproteins.
AB  - A set of open reading frames (ORFs) potentially encoding signal transduction proteins are clustered around icfG, a gene implicated in the regulation of carbon metabolism, in the genome of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. slr1860 is the ORF for icfG, whose predicted product resembles the protein phosphatases SpoIIE, RsbU, and RsbX from Bacillus subtilis. Bracketing slr1860/icfG are (i) ORF slr1861, whose predicted product resembles the SpoIIAB, RsbT, and RsbW protein kinases from B. subtilis, and (ii) ORFs slr1856 and slr1859, whose predicted products resemble the respective phosphoprotein substrates for the B. subtilis protein kinases: SpoIIAA, RsbS, and RsbV. In order to determine whether the protein products encoded by these ORFs possessed the functional capabilities suggested by sequence comparisons, each was expressed in Escherichia coli as a histidine-tagged fusion protein and analyzed for its ability to participate in protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes in vitro. It was observed that ORF slr1861 encoded an ATP-dependent protein kinase capable of phosphorylating Slr1856 and, albeit with noticeably lower efficiency, Slr1859. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that Slr1861 phosphorylated these proteins on Ser-54 and Ser-57, respectively. Slr1860 exhibited divalent metal ion-dependent protein-serine phosphatase activity. It catalyzed the dephosphorylation of Slr1856, but not Slr1859, in vitro.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the beta-fructofuranosidase gene from Bacillus sp. V230.
AB  - The beta-fructofuranosidase gene (bff) from Bacillus sp. V230 has been cloned in  Escherichia coli and its nucleotide sequence has been analyzed. The product of bff consists of a signal sequence of 32 amino acid (a.a.) residues for secretion and 455 a.a. residues of the extracellular beta-fructofuranosidase. The a.a. sequence of the bff product has similarities with those of the Bacillus subtilis levanscrase (63.7% identity), the Streptococcus mutans fructosyltransferase (33.7%), and the Zymomonas mobilis levanscrase and beta-fructofuranosidase (15%).
TI  - Establishing the independent culture of a strictly symbiotic bacterium Symbiobacterium thermophilum from its supporting Bacillus strain.
AB  - Symbiobacterium thermophilum is a strictly symbiotic thermophile, the growth of which is dependent on the coexistence of an associating thermophilic Bacillus sp., strain S. S. thermophilum grows only in mixed culture with the Bacillus strain in liquid media, and does not form visible colonies on solid media. To measure the growth of this symbiotic bacterium and to analyze its growth requirements, we developed a quantitative PCR method by using its specific sequences in a putative membrane translocator gene tnaT as primers. According to this method, independent growth of S. thermophilum was first confirmed in a dialyzing culture physically separated from Bacillus strain S with a cellulose membrane. Independent growth of S. thermophilum was also managed by adding conditioned medium prepared from the culture filtrate of the Bacillus strain, but the growth in the conditioned medium stopped at a very limited extent with appearance of filamentous cells, suggesting the uncoupling of cellular growth and cell division. Formation of micro-colonies of S. thermophilum was observed on the conditioned agar medium under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, but the colony-forming efficiencies remained below 1%. Several other bacterial species, such as Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Thermus thermophilus, and even Escherichia coli, were also found to support the growth of S. thermophilum. These results indicate that S. thermophilum essentially requires some ubiquitous metabolite(s) of low molecular weight produced by various bacterial species as growth factor(s) but coexistence of the living partner cells is still required, probably to maintain an effective level of the putative factor(s) in the medium.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tea as affected by the degree of fermentation and manufacturing season.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella sp. and Staphylococcus aureus were used to test the antimicrobial activity of tea flush extract and extracts of various tea products. Among the six test organisms, P. fluorescens was the most sensitive to the extracts, while B. subtilis was the least sensitive. In general, antimicrobial activity decreased when the extents of tea fermentation increased. The antimicrobial activities of tea flush extract and extracts of tea products with different extents of fermentation varied with test organisms. Tea flush and Green tea, the unfermented tea, exerted the strongest antimicrobial activity followed by the partially fermented tea products such as Longjing, Tieh-Kuan-Ying, Paochung, and Oolong teas. On the other hand, Black tea, the completely fermented tea, showed the least antimicrobial activity. It was also noted that extracts of Oolong tea prepared in summer exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity, followed by those prepared in spring, winter and fall.
TI  - Role of metal ions in the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by RNase P RNA from Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Precursor tRNA (ptRNA) substrates carrying a single Rp or Sp-phosphorothioate modification at the RNase P cleavage site were used as tools to study the cleavage mechanism of RNase P RNA from Bacillus subtilis. Both the Sp and the Rp-diastereomer reduced the rate of processing at least 10(4)-fold under conditions where the chemical step is essentially rate-limiting. Neither the Rp nor the Sp-phosphorothioate modification affected ptRNA ground state binding to B. subtilis RNase P RNA. Processing of the Rp-diastereomeric ptRNA could be restored in the presence of Mn2+or Cd2+, demonstrating direct metal ion coordination to the pro -Rp oxygen during catalysis. With Cd2+, processing required the presence of another metal ion, such as Ca2+or Mg2+, to mediate substrate binding. This is in contrast to Escherichia coli RNase P RNA, which promotes cleavage of Rp-diastereomeric ptRNA in the presence of Cd2+as the sole divalent metal ion. Analysis of [Cd2+]-dependent processing of the Rp-diastereomeric substrate by B. subtilis RNase P RNA was consistent with the involvement of at least two metal ions in catalysis. The presence of two catalytic metal ion binding sites is also supported by the inhibition mode of Ca2+on cleavage of unmodified ptRNA. In the presence of an Sp-phosphorothioate modification at the scissile bond, neither Mn2+nor Cd2+were able to restore significant cleavage at this location. Instead, the ribozyme promotes cleavage at the neighboring unmodified phosphodiester with low efficiency. Unaffected ground state binding of the Sp-diastereomeric ptRNA but a >/=10(4)-fold reduced hydrolysis rate may indicate a crucial role of the pro -Sp oxygen in transition state stabilization or may be attributed to steric exclusion of catalytic metal ions. Based on our comparative analyses of B. subtilis and E. coli RNase P RNA, each representing the main structural subtypes of bacterial RNase P RNA, common features in terms of active site constraints and role of catalytic metal ions can now be formulated for bacterial RNase P RNAs. On the other hand, substantial and unexpected differences with respect to the overall metal ion requirements and tRNA binding modes have been observed for the two catalytic RNAs.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of Paenibacillus polymyxa SCE2 against human pathogenic micro-organisms.
AB  - Paenibacillus polymyxa strain SCE2 was shown to inhibit the growth of different potential human pathogenic bacterial strains and fungi in vitro. To determine the genetic characterization of this antimicrobial substance, strain SCE2 was transformed with plasmid pTV32(Ts), a delivery vector for Tn917-lac. After transposition, four mutants were shown to have lost their capability to inhibit Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus RN450, but they continued to inhibit the growth of Corynebacterium fimi NCTC7547 and Escherichia coli HB101. Hybridization experiments using the DNA of the four mutants digested with different endonucleases and pTV32(Ts) as a probe showed that the place of insertion of Tn917-lac in the chromosome was the same in mutants 4 and 36 and in mutants 31 and 59, but different between these pairs. It is thought possible that more than one antimicrobial substance is being produced by strain SCE2.
TI  - Putative mechanism of natural transformation as deduced from genome data.
AB  - Genetic transformation is widely utilized in molecular biology as a tool for gene cloning in Escherichia coli and for gene mapping in Bacillus subtilis. Several strains of eubacteria can naturally take up exogenous DNA and integrate the DNA into their own genomes. Molecular details of natural transformation, however, remained to be elucidated. The complete genome of a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, has been sequenced. This bacterium has been used to examine functions of a particular gene. The genome is considered to carry information on natural transformable characteristics of Synechocystis. The first step in genetic transformation is the uptake of exogenous DNA. Proteins with non-specific DNA binding features are required, because specificity in the exogenous DNA has not been demonstrated. Such proteins have modules interacting with the phosphate backbone of DNA, including helix-turn-helix modules. Using a consensus pattern of the phosphate-binding helix-turn-helix module, we searched through the genome data of Synechocystis for genes or open reading frame (ORF) products with the pattern in primary structures. We found that an ORF, slr0197, has the pattern in duplicate at the C-terminal region. We also found that the ORF product has a hydrophobic segment at the N-terminal region, which is followed by two internal repeats of the endonuclease domain. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the initial stage of genetic transformation. This is apparently the first report on molecular mechanisms of natural transformation.
TI  - Evaluation of a modified enzymatic test for the detection of tetracyclines in milk.
AB  - The tetracycline galactosidase (TG) test, a new method for the detection of tetracycline residues in raw milk based on the inhibition of beta-galactosidase biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, was previously validated with spiked milk samples. It has now been applied to milk from cows treated with oxytetracycline. In view of the occurrence of false positives, related to highly elevated somatic cell counts (>10(6)/ml), the improved TG test was developed, in which a heating step (80 degrees C, 15 min) preceded the original TG test protocol. A good agreement with other assays (Delvotest SP, the Bacillus cereus microtiter test, the LacTek tetracycline milk screening test, the Charm HVS-8100 tetracycline test) as well as with high-pressure liquid chromatography was obtained. No false negatives were observed with reference to the established maximum residue limit for tetracyclines of 100 microg/kg milk.
TI  - Monomeric sarcosine oxidase: structure of a covalently flavinylated amine oxidizing enzyme.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monomeric sarcosine oxidases (MSOXs) are among the simplest members of a recently recognized family of eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes that catalyze similar oxidative reactions with various secondary or tertiary amino acids and contain covalently bound flavins. Other members of this family include heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase, N-methyltryptophan oxidase and pipecolate oxidase. Mammalian sarcosine dehydrogenase and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase may be more distantly related family members. RESULTS: The X-ray crystal structure of MSOX from Bacillus sp. B-0618, expressed in Escherichia coli, has been solved at 2.0 A resolution by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) from crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted enzyme. Fourteen selenium sites, belonging to two MSOX molecules in the asymmetric unit, were used for MAD phasing and to define the local twofold symmetry axis for electron-density averaging. The structures of the native enzyme and of two enzyme-inhibitor complexes were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: MSOX is a two-domain protein with an overall topology most similar to that of D-amino acid oxidase, with which it shares 14% sequence identity. The flavin ring is located in a very basic environment, making contact with sidechains of arginine, lysine, histidine and the N-terminal end of a helix dipole. The flavin is covalently attached through an 8alpha-S-cysteinyl linkage to Cys315 of the catalytic domain. Covalent attachment is probably self-catalyzed through interactions with the positive sidechains and the helix dipole. Substrate binding is probably stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the substrate carboxylate and two basic sidechains, Arg52 and Lys348, located above the re face of the flavin ring.
TI  - The physiological contribution of Acinetobacter PcaK, a transport system that acts upon protocatechuate, can be masked by the overlapping specificity of VanK.
AB  - VanK is the fourth member of the ubiquitous major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins to be identified that, together with PcaK, BenK, and MucK, contributes to aromatic catabolism in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1. VanK and PcaK have overlapping specificity for p-hydroxybenzoate and, most clearly, for protocatechuate: inactivation of both proteins severely impairs growth with protocatechuate, and the activity of either protein alone can mask the phenotype associated with inactivation of its homolog. Furthermore, vanK pcaK double-knockout mutants appear completely unable to grow in liquid culture with the hydroaromatic compound quinate, although such cells on plates convert quinate to protocatechuate, which then accumulates extracellularly and is readily visible as purple staining. This provides genetic evidence that quinate is converted to protocatechuate in the periplasm and is in line with the early argument that quinate catabolism should be physically separated from aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the cytoplasm so as to avoid potential competition for intermediates common to both pathways. Previous studies of aromatic catabolism in Acinetobacter have taken advantage of the ability to select directly strains that contain a spontaneous mutation blocking the beta-ketoadipate pathway and preventing the toxic accumulation of carboxymuconate. By using this procedure, strains with a mutation in structural or regulatory genes blocking degradation of vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoate, or protocatechuate were selected. In this study, the overlapping specificity of the VanK and PcaK permeases was exploited to directly select strains with a mutation in either vanK or pcaK. Spontaneous mutations identified in vanK include a hot spot for frameshift mutation due to contraction of a G6 mononucleotide repeat as well as point mutations producing amino acid substitutions useful for analysis of VanK structure and function. Preliminary second-site suppression analysis using transformation-facilitated PCR mutagenesis in one VanK mutant gave results similar to those using LacY, the prototypic member of the major facilitator superfamily, consistent with the two proteins having a similar mechanism of action. The selection for transport mutants described here for Acinetobacter may also be applicable to Pseudomonas putida, where the PcaK permease has an additional role in chemotaxis.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization of the rolling-circle plasmid pIP823 from Listeria monocytogenes BM4293 among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We determined the sequence and genetic organization of plasmid pIP823, which contains the dfrD gene; dfrD confers high-level trimethoprim resistance to Listeria monocytogenes BM4293 by synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase type S2. pIP823 possessed all the features of the pUB110/pC194 plasmid family, whose members replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. The rep gene encoded a protein identical to RepU, the protein required for initiation of the replication of plasmids pTB913 from a thermophilic Bacillus sp. and pUB110 from Staphylococcus aureus. The mob gene encoded a protein with a high degree of amino acid identity with the Mob proteins involved in conjugative mobilization and interplasmidic recombination of pTB913 and pUB110. The host range of pIP823 was broad and included L. monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. In all these species, pIP823 replicated by generating single-stranded DNA and was stable. Conjugative mobilization of pIP823 was obtained by self-transferable plasmids between L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis, between L. monocytogenes and E. coli, and between strains of E. coli, and by the streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn1545 from L. monocytogenes to E. faecalis, and from L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis to E. coli. These data indicate that the gene flux observed in nature from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria can occur by conjugative mobilization. Our results suggest that dissemination of trimethoprim resistance in Listeria spp. and acquisition of other antibiotic resistance determinants in this species can be anticipated.
TI  - Purification and characterization of thermostable aspartase from Bacillus sp. YM55-1.
AB  - A thermostable aspartase was purified from a thermophile Bacillus sp. YM55-1 and  characterized in terms of activity and stability. The enzyme was isolated by a 5-min heat treatment at 75 degrees C in the presence of 11% (w/v) ammonium sulfate and 100 mM aspartate, followed by Q-Sepharose anion-exchange and AF-Red Toyopearl chromatographies. The native molecular weight of aspartase determined by gel filtration was about 200,000, and this enzyme was composed of four identical monomers with molecular weights of 51,000 determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unlike Escherichia coli aspartase, the enzyme was not activated by the presence of magnesium ion at alkaline pH. At the optimum pH, the Km and Vmax were 28.5 mM and 700 units/mg at 30 degrees C and 32.0 mM and 2200 units/mg at 55 degrees C, respectively. The specific activity was four and three times higher than those of E. coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens enzymes at 30 degrees C, respectively. Eighty percent of the activity was retained after a 60-min incubation at 55 degrees C, and the enzyme was also resistant to chemical denaturants; 80% of the initial specific activity was detected in assay mixtures containing 1.0 M guanidine hydrochloride. The purified enzyme shared a high sequence homology in the N-terminal region with aspartases from other organisms.
TI  - Structure of the flavocoenzyme of two homologous amine oxidases: monomeric sarcosine oxidase and N-methyltryptophan oxidase.
AB  - Monomeric sarcosine oxidase (MSOX) and N-methyltryptophan oxidase (MTOX) are homologous enzymes that catalyze the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine (N-methylglycine) and N-methyl-L-tryptophan, respectively. MSOX is induced in various bacteria upon growth on sarcosine. MTOX is an E. coli enzyme of unknown metabolic function. Both enzymes contain covalently bound flavin. The covalent flavin is at the FAD level as judged by electrospray mass spectrometry. The data provide the first evidence that MTOX is a flavoprotein. The following observations indicate that 8alpha-(S-cysteinyl)FAD is the covalent flavin in MSOX from Bacillus sp. B-0618 and MTOX. FMN-containing peptides, prepared by digestion of MSOX or MTOX with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and phosphodiesterase, exhibited absorption and fluorescence properties characteristic of an 8alpha-(S-cysteinyl)flavin and could be bound to apo-flavodoxin. The thioether link in the FMN-containing peptides was converted to the sulfone by performic acid oxidation, as judged by characteristic absorbance changes and an increase in flavin fluorescence. The sulfone underwent a predicted reductive cleavage reaction upon treatment with dithionite, releasing unmodified FMN. Cys315 was identified as the covalent FAD attachment site in MSOX from B. sp. B-0618, as judged by the sequence obtained for a flavin-containing tryptic peptide (GAVCMYT). Cys315 aligns with a conserved cysteine in MSOX from other bacteria, MTOX (Cys308) and pipecolate oxidase, a homologous mammalian enzyme known to contain covalently bound flavin. There is only one conserved cysteine found among these enzymes, suggesting that Cys308 is the covalent flavin attachment site in MTOX.
TI  - Expression of prokaryotic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphatases in Escherichia coli increases carotenoid and ubiquinone biosynthesis.
AB  - Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) acts as the common, five-carbon building block in the biosynthesis of all isoprenoids. The first reaction of IPP biosynthesis in Escherichia coli is the formation of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate, catalysed by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS). E. coli engineered to produce lycopene, was transformed with dxps genes cloned from Bacillus subtilis and Synechocystis sp. 6803. Increases in lycopene levels were observed in strains expressing exogenous DXPS compared to controls. The recombinant strains also exhibited elevated levels of ubiquinone-8. These increases corresponded with enhanced DXP synthase activity in the recombinant E. coli strains.
TI  - The biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. Some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. The aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tyrosyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl). The enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The induction of differentiation in HT-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. Antibiotic properties against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilus and Streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion assay. Results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Three of the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. All the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. These results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.
TI  - Cloning and bacterial expression of adenosine-5'-triphosphate sulfurylase from the enteric protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - A gene encoding adenosine-5'-triphosphate sulfurylase (AS) was cloned from the enteric protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to conserved regions of the protein from a variety of organisms. The deduced amino acid sequence of E. histolytica AS revealed a calculated molecular mass of 47925 Da and an unusual basic pI of 9.38. The amebic protein sequence showed 23-48% identities with AS from bacteria, yeasts, fungi, plants, and animals with the highest identities being to Synechocystis sp. and Bacillus subtilis (48 and 44%, respectively). Four conserved blocks including putative sulfate-binding and phosphate-binding regions were highly conserved in the E. histolytica AS. The upstream region of the AS gene contained three conserved elements reported for other E. histolytica genes. A recombinant E. histolytica AS revealed enzymatic activity, measured in both the forward and reverse directions. Expression of the E. histolytica AS complemented cysteine auxotrophy of the AS-deficient Escherichia coli strains. Genomic hybridization revealed that the AS gene exists as a single copy gene. In the literature, this is the first description of an AS gene in Protozoa.
TI  - Small genes/gene-products in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Forty-two protein spots of observed M(r) 6-15 kDa were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, stained by Coomassie blue and subjected to Edman microsequencing. All of the proteins could be related back to their encoding open reading frames, thereby vindicating the bioinformatic tools currently utilised in their identification. However, only 14/42 gene-products were expressed as annotated. Translation was confirmed for 14 open reading frames with no attributed function (EcoGene Y-entries), while N-terminal sequence allowed the start codon to be accurately annotated for the genes yigF, yccU, yqiC, ynfD, and yeeX. The methionine start codon was cleaved in 11 gene-products (AtpE, Hns, RpoZ, RplL, CspC, YccJ, YggX, YjgF, HimA, InfA, RpsQ) and a further five showed loss of a signal peptide (PspE, HdeB, HdeA, YnfD, YkfE). Internal (Tig, AtpA, TufA) and N-terminal fragmentation (CspD, RpsF, AtcU) of much larger proteins was also detected, which may have resulted from physiological or translational processes. M(r) and pI isoforms were detected respectively for PtsH and GatB, each being phosphoproteins, as well as RplY which manifested differences with respect to predicted M(r) and pI. In addition, YjgF was shown to belong to a small gene family of unknown function with ancient conserved regions across procaryotes and eucaryotes. YgiN was revealed to have a paralogue and orthologues in Bacillus subtilis, Synechocystis sp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria gonorrhoea, and Rhodococcus erythropolis. Orthologues are also reported for YihD, YccU and YeeX. Of the 14 Y-genes, only YkfE possessed no detectable orthologues. These results highlight the need to complement genomic analysis with detailed proteomics in order to gain a better understanding of cellular molecular biology, while the confirmation of the open reading frame start codon using Edman degradation protein microsequencing has yet to be superseded by recent advances in mass spectrometry.
TI  - The serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine-specific protein kinases and protein phosphatases of prokaryotic organisms: a family portrait.
AB  - Inspection of the genomes for the bacteria Bacillus subtilis 168, Borrelia burgdorferi B31, Escherichia coli K-12, Haemophilus influenzae KW20, Helicobacter pylori 26695, Mycoplasma genitalium G-37, and Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 and for the archaeons Archaeoglobus fulgidus VC-16 DSM4304, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H, and Methanococcus jannaschii DSM2661 revealed that each contains at least one ORF whose predicted product displays sequence features characteristic of eukaryote-like protein-serine/threonine/tyrosine kinases and protein-serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphatases. Orthologs for all four major protein phosphatase families (PPP, PPM, conventional PTP, and low molecular weight PTP) were present in the bacteria surveyed, but not all strains contained all types. The three archaeons surveyed lacked recognizable homologs of the PPM family of eukaryotic protein-serine/threonine phosphatases; and only two prokaryotes were found to contain ORFs for potential phosphatases from all four major families. Intriguingly, our searches revealed a potential ancestral link between the catalytic subunits of microbial arsenate reductases and the protein-tyrosine phosphatases; they share similar ligands (arsenate versus phosphate) and features of their catalytic mechanism (formation of arseno-versus phospho-cysteinyl intermediates). It appears that all prokaryotic organisms, at one time, contained the genetic information necessary to construct protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation networks that target serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine residues on proteins. However, the potential for functional redundancy among the four protein phosphatase families has led many prokaryotic organisms to discard one, two, or three of the four.
TI  - Bacterial infection and endotoxin in female reproductive tract in rats: correlation with the developmental status of preimplantation embryos.
AB  - During mammalian preimplantation development, a substantial numbers of embryos are believed to be lost for reasons that are unclear. Using female rats, we investigated whether the developmental status of embryos is influenced by bacterial infection and endotoxin in the reproductive tract. From the vagina of cycling rats (n = 11), 21 bacterial isolates were identified; they were Streptococcus faecalis (S. faecalis; 38%), Escherichia coli (E. coli; 19%), Acinetobactor calcoaceticus (A. calcoaceticus; 14%), and coagulase negative staphylococcus (14%), Micrococcus sp. (5%), Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis; 5%) and Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris; 5%). From the vagina of day 4 pregnant rats (n = 12), 26 isolates were identified; they were S. faecalis (23%), A. calcoaceticus (23%), E. coli (15%), Micrococcus sp. (15%), B. subtilis (8%), P. vulgaris (4%), Staphylococcus aureus (4%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%). Gram negative bacteria found in the vagina of cycling and day 4 pregnant rats were 38% and 46%, respectively. In both, bacterial load was 10(3)-10(5) colony forming units and there was no association with the abnormality of the recovered embryos. However, in two day 4 pregnant animals, pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococcus) were isolated and embryos recovered from them were degenerated and deformed. The vagina of day 9 pregnant animals (n = 7) were, however, sterile. Consistently, in all animals, the upper reproductive tract (uterus and oviduct) was devoid of any bacteria and no anaerobic bacteria were isolated from any part of the tract. The levels of endotoxin in the vagina of cycling and day 4 pregnant rats were 1.35 +/- 0.1 and 1.17 +/- 0.1 endotoxin units (EU), respectively. It was undetectable in the oviduct and uterus of all animals (n = 5) except one which showed high levels of endotoxin in uterus (4.5 EU) and oviduct (2.2 EU) and the animal also produced degenerated and deformed embryos. These results indicate that common bacterial flora of vagina may not affect embryo development and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina and/or endotoxin in reproductive tract could be detrimental to viability of gametes and preimplantation embryos in rats.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the gene encoding RNA polymerase alpha subunit from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125.
AB  - The rpoA gene, encoding the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase, was isolated from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125 by the PCR method. A 3-kb HindIII fragment containing the complete rpoA gene was cloned and sequenced. The alpha subunit gene was found to encode a protein consisting of 314 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 34,805 Da. Compared with the amino acid sequences of other known eubacterial RNA polymerase alpha subunits, the gene has 84% identity to that of B. subtilis, while showing 48% and 47% identity to that of Streptomyces coelicolor and Escherichia coli, respectively. Six conserved regions, which are observed in the case of other eubacteria, were found in the RNA polymerase alpha subunit of this strain. Five of them are located in the N-terminal domain involved in assembly of the core enzyme, while one is located in the C-terminal domain, which interacts with several transcriptional factors and a specific DNA element. By means of recombinant plasmids, a hexahistidine-tagged derivative of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit of strain C-125 and two deletion derivatives (C- and N-terminal domains) of this protein were overexpressed in E. coli cells and purified to near homogeneity.
TI  - Molecular cloning of two genes for beta-D-glucosidase in Bacillus sp. GL1 and identification of one as a gellan-degrading enzyme.
AB  - In the bacterium Bacillus sp. GL1, gellan is depolymerized to give a tetrasaccharide by extracellular gellan lyase and then the tetrasaccharide is converted to constituent monosaccharides by intracellular glycosidases. Two genes encoding one of the glycosidases, beta-D-glucosidase (Bgl), were cloned in a genomic DNA library of the bacterium constructed in Escherichia coli and nucleotide sequences of the genes were determined. One of the genes, termed bglA, contained an open reading frame (ORF) consisting of 1344 base pairs coding a polypeptide (BglA) with a molecular mass of 51 kDa and the other, termed bglB, 2268 base pairs coding a protein (BglB) with a molecular mass of 82 kDa. By homology analyses of the ORFs against protein sequence databases, beta-D-glucosidase A (BglA) and beta-D-glucosidase B (BglB) were found to be classified into subfamilies BGA and BGB of cellulase family BG, respectively. BglA and BglB purified from E. coli were monomeric enzymes with molecular masses of 50 and 82 kDa and most active at pH 6.0 and 8.0, respectively. BglA showed broader substrate specificity than BglB. Only BglA acted on the tetrasaccharide produced from gellan by gellan lyase and released glucose from the molecule.
TI  - Characterization of the basic replicon of Rhodococcus plasmid pSOX and development of a Rhodococcus-Escherichia coli shuttle vector.
AB  - The replication region of a 100-kb desulfurization plasmid (pSOX) from Rhodococcus sp. strain X309 was localized to a 4-kb KpnI fragment, and its sequence was determined. The amino acid sequence of one of the predicted open reading frames (ORFs) was related to the putative replication (Rep) protein sequences of the mycobacterial pLR7 family of plasmids. Three of the five predicted ORF products were identified by radiolabelling with the Escherichia coli T7 polymerase/promoter system. In E. coli, the Rep protein of pSOX was apparently synthesized in a shortened form, 21.3 kDa instead of the predicted 41.3 kDa, as a result of an internal initiation. This situation is reminescent of that for some bacterial Rep proteins. A shuttle plasmid was constructed with the pSOX origin, pBluescript II KS-, and the chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr) gene from pRF29. This new shuttle plasmid was used to demonstrate expression of the Bacillus subtilis sacB gene in a strain of Rhodococcus, rendering it sensitive to the presence of sucrose.
TI  - Mutations in Bartonella bacilliformis gyrB confer resistance to coumermycin A1.
AB  - This study describes the first isolation and characterization of spontaneous mutants conferring natural resistance to an antibiotic for any Bartonella species. The Bartonella bacilliformis gyrB gene, which encodes the B subunit of DNA gyrase, was cloned and sequenced. The gyrB open reading frame (ORF) is 2,079 bp and encodes a deduced amino acid sequence of 692 residues, corresponding to a predicted protein of approximately 77.5 kDa. Sequence alignment indicates that B. bacilliformis GyrB is most similar to the GyrB protein from Bacillus subtilis (40.1% amino acid sequence identity) and that it contains the longest N-terminal tail (52 residues) of any GyrB characterized to date. The cloned B. bacilliformis gyrB was expressed in an Escherichia coli S30 cell extract and was able to functionally complement a temperature-sensitive E. coli Cour gyrB mutant (strain N4177). We isolated and characterized spontaneous mutants of B. bacilliformis resistant to coumermycin A1, an antibiotic that targets GyrB. Sequence analysis of gyrB from 12 Cour mutants of B. bacilliformis identified single nucleotide transitions at three separate loci in the ORF. The predicted amino acid substitutions resulting from these transitions are Gly to Ser at position 124 (Gly124-->Ser), Arg184-->Gln, and Thr214-->Ala or Thr214-->Ile, which are analogous to mutated residues found in previously characterized resistant gyrB genes from Borrelia burgdorferi, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haloferax sp. The Cour mutants are three to five times more resistant to coumermycin A1 than the wild-type parental strain.
TI  - A five-nucleotide sequence protects DNA from exonucleolytic degradation by AddAB, the RecBCD analogue of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Homologous recombination in Bacillus subtilis requires the product of the addA and addB genes, the AddAB enzyme. This enzyme, which is both a helicase and a powerful nuclease, is thought to be the counterpart of the Escherichia coli RecBCD enzyme. From this analogy, it is expected that the nuclease activity of AddAB can be downregulated by a specific DNA sequence, which would correspond to the chi site in E. coli. Using protection of linear double-stranded DNA as a criterion, we identified the five-nucleotide sequence 5'-AGCGG-3', or its complement 5'-CCGCT-3', as being sufficient for AddAB nuclease attenuation. We have shown further that this attenuation occurs only if the sequence is properly oriented with respect to the translocating AddAB enzyme. Finally, inspection of the complete B. subtilis genome revealed that this five-nucleotide sequence is over-represented and is, in a majority of cases, co-oriented with DNA replication. Based on these observations, we propose that 5'-AGCGG-3', or its complement, is the B. subtilis analogue of the E. coli chi sequence.
TI  - Universal ribotyping method using a chemically labelled oligonucleotide probe mixture.
AB  - Some of the present problems in ribotyping are associated with a lack of uniform  reactivity of probes when bacterial DNAs are of phylogenetically diverse origins. To overcome these problems, a set of five oligonucleotides (referred to as OligoMix5) was selected to react with conserved sequences located near both extremities of rrs (16S rRNA gene) and near both extremities and the middle of rrl (23S rRNA gene). DNA samples from 13 bacterial species selected to represent various phylogenetic branches within the Eubacteria were cleaved by a restriction endonuclease and electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose, and the fragments were vacuum-transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with digoxigenin-labelled OligoMix5, plasmid DNA from pKK3535 (cloned rrn operon from Escherichia coli) or pBA2 (cloned rrs from Bacillus subtilis), or acetylamino-fluorene-labelled E. coli 16 + 23S rRNA. The results showed OligoMix5 to visualize patterns in DNA from phylogenetically diverse bacteria with comparable intensity. Banding patterns (not band intensity) obtained with OligoMix5 were identical with those obtained with 16 + 23S rRNA or plasmid pKK3535 for each strain studied and represented complete ribotypes. For DNA from Gram-positive bacteria, complete ribotypes were observed after prolonged enzymatic detection of bands when probes were either E. coli 16 + 23S rRNA or pKK3535. Patterns given by plasmid pBA2 were subsets of the complete ribotypes for 9/13 strains. Each oligonucleotide of the OligoMix5 set was used as a probe to determine its contribution to the complete ribotype. The five oligonucleotide probes, used individually, visualized one to four patterns per DNA sample. Use of DNA from Xenorhabdus sp. CIP 105189 cleaved by EcoRI is suggested to control the quality of the oligonucleotide probes composing OligoMix5. Probe OligoMix5 was found to be an essential tool for ribotyping phylogenetically diverse eubacteria.
TI  - Spore photoproduct lyase from Bacillus subtilis spores is a novel iron-sulfur DNA repair enzyme which shares features with proteins such as class III anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases and pyruvate-formate lyases.
AB  - The major photoproduct in UV-irradiated spore DNA is the unique thymine dimer 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine, commonly referred to as spore photoproduct (SP). An important determinant of the high UV resistance of Bacillus subtilis spores is the accurate in situ reversal of SP during spore germination by the DNA repair enzyme SP lyase. To study the molecular aspects of SP lyase-mediated SP repair, the cloned B. subtilis splB gene was engineered to encode SP lyase with a molecular tag of six histidine residues at its amino terminus. The engineered six-His-tagged SP lyase expressed from the amyE locus restored UV resistance to spores of a UV-sensitive mutant B. subtilis strain carrying a deletion-insertion mutation which removed the entire splAB operon at its natural locus and was shown to repair SP in vivo during spore germination. The engineered SP lyase was purified both from dormant B. subtilis spores and from an Escherichia coli overexpression system by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) agarose affinity chromatography and was shown by Western blotting, UV-visible spectroscopy, and iron and acid-labile sulfide analysis to be a 41-kDa iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein, consistent with its amino acid sequence homology to the 4Fe-4S clusters in anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases and pyruvate-formate lyases. SP lyase was capable of reversing SP from purified SP-containing DNA in an in vitro reaction either when present in a cell-free extract prepared from dormant spores or after purification on nickel-NTA agarose. SP lyase activity was dependent upon reducing conditions and addition of S-adenosylmethionine as a cofactor.
TI  - New types of liposidomycins that inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis and are produced by Streptomyces. II. Isolation and structure elucidation.
AB  - Various new liposidomycins were isolated from a culture of the strain Streptomyces sp. SN-1061M by changing medium components and they were classified into four types (I-IV) based on their structures. They were purified by butanol extraction, silica gel and LH-20 column chromatographies, and high performance liquid chromatography on ODS columns. Type (I) has the original structure which has sulfate and 3-methylglutaric acid moieties. Type (II) has no 3-methylglutaric acid moiety and type (III) has no sulfate moiety. Type (IV) has neither moiety. Type (III) and (IV) compounds, which have no sulfate moiety, exhibited more potent antimicrobial activity.
TI  - High-level expression of an endoxylanase gene from Bacillus sp. in Bacillus subtilis DB104 for the production of xylobiose from xylan.
AB  - To produce xylobiose from xylan, high-level expression of an endoxylanase gene from Bacillus sp. was carried out in Bacillus sabtilis DB104. A 1.62-kb SmaI DNA fragment, coding for an endoxylanase of Bacillus sp., was ligated into the Escherichia coli/B. subtilis shuttle vector pJH27 delta 88, producing pJHKJ4, which was subsequently transformed into B. subtilis DB104. A maximum endoxylanase activity of 105 U/ml was obtained from the supernatant of B. subtilis DB104 harboring pJHKJ4. The endoxylanase was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography and the production profile of xylooligosaccharides from xylan by the endoxylanase was examined by HPLC with a carbohydrate analysis column. Xylobiose was the major product from xylan at 40 degrees C and its proportion in the xylan hydrolyzates increased with the reaction time; at 12 h, over 60% of the reaction products was xylobiose. These results suggest that xylobiose, which has a stimulatory effect on the selective growth of the intestinal bacterium Bifidobacterium, can be mass-produced effectively by the endoxylanase of Bacillus sp. cloned in B. subtilis.
TI  - Cloning of a new endoglucanase gene from Bacillus sp. BP-23 and characterisation  of the enzyme. Performance in paper manufacture from cereal straw.
AB  - The gene ce1A, encoding an endoglucanase from the strain Bacillus sp. BP-23, was  cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a 1867-bp DNA fragment containing the ce1A gene was determined, revealing an open reading frame of 1200 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 44,803 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded enzyme shows high homology to those of enzymes belonging to subtype 4 of the family-A cellulases. The ce1A gene product synthesized in E. coli showed activity on carboxymethylcellulose and lichenan but no activity was found on Avicel. Activity was enhanced in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ and Ca2+ and showed its maximum at 40 degrees C and pH 4.0. Study of the performance of Ce1A on paper manufacture from agricultural fibres showed that treatment with the enzyme improved the properties of the pulp and the quality of paper. Ce1A treatment enhanced the physical properties (stretch and tensile index) of paper from wheat straw, while dewatering properties were slightly diminished. Electron-microscope analysis showed that the surface of straw fibres was modified by Ce1A.
TI  - A 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase catalyzing the formation of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate in an alternative nonmevalonate pathway for terpenoid biosynthesis.
AB  - Several eubacteria including Esherichia coli use an alternative nonmevalonate pathway for the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate instead of the ubiquitous mevalonate pathway. In the alternative pathway, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol or its 4-phosphate, which is proposed to be formed from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate via intramolecular rearrangement followed by reduction process, is one of the biosynthetic precursors of isopentenyl diphosphate. To clone the gene(s) responsible for synthesis of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate, we prepared and selected E. coli mutants with an obligatory requirement for 2-C-methylerythritol for growth and survival. All the DNA fragments that complemented the defect in synthesizing 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate of these mutants contained the yaeM gene, which is located at 4.2 min on the chromosomal map of E. coli. The gene product showed significant homologies to hypothetical proteins with unknown functions present in Haemophilus influenzae, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pyroli, and Bacillus subtilis. The purified recombinant yaeM gene product was overexpressed in E. coli and found to catalyze the formation of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate in the presence of NADPH. Replacement of NADPH with NADH decreased the reaction rate to about 1% of the original rate. The enzyme required Mn2+, Co2+, or Mg2+ as well. These data clearly show that the yaeM gene encodes an enzyme, designated 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, that synthesizes 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, in a single step by intramolecular rearrangement and reduction and that this gene is responsible for terpenoid biosynthesis in E. coli.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the transglutaminase gene from Bacillus subtilis and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - We cloned and characterized a gene, tgl, encoding transglutaminase in Bacillus subtilis. The tgl gene contained a open reading frame 735-nucleotides long that encoded a 245-residue protein with the molecular weight of 28,300. The deduced amino acid sequence had little sequence similarity with sequences of other transglutaminases from a Streptoverticillium sp. or from mammals. The -10 and -35 regions of a putative promoter resembled the consensus sequence for the sigma K-dependent promoter. In addition, a sequence similar to the consensus sequence for the GerE binding site was found upstream from this region. These findings suggested that tgl was transcribed in the mother cells during a late stage of sporulation. Evidence for this suggestion was that transglutaminase activity was detected in sporulating cells during the same stage. Transglutaminase activity was detected in Escherichia coli cells transformed with a plasmid for expression of the tgl gene.
TI  - Immunoelectron microscopic studies indicate the existence of a cell shape preserving cytoskeleton in prokaryotes.
AB  - Immunoelectron microscopic studies of prokaryotes were performed with anti-actin  antibodies directed against the C terminus of actin. Studies on ultrathin sections revealed high proportions of the overall label close to the cell periphery in Escherichia coli, Ralstonia eutropha, Thermoanaerobacterium thermosulfurigenes, T. thermosaccharolyticum, and Methanococcus jannaschii. Substantial label also in the cytoplasm was observed in Bacillus sp., Methanococcus voltae, and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. Only very minor amounts of label were found in the nucleoid region of the cells. Whole-mount immunogold studies, combined with negative staining, revealed the existence of an intracellular network of fibrils which could be labeled by anti-actin antibodies. This network is assumed to be located below the cytoplasmic membrane all around the cytoplasm. It appears to have properties that would allow its function as a cytoskeleton-like structure preserving cell shape.
TI  - Biologically active polymers: synthesis and antimicrobial activity of modified glycidyl methacrylate polymers having a quaternary ammonium and phosphonium groups.
AB  - Polymers with antibacterial activity have been synthesized by chemical modification of poly(glycidyl methacrylate). The glycidyl methacrylate was polymerized by the free radical polymerization technique. The poly(glycidyl methacrylate) was hydrolyzed and was chloroacetylated using chloroacetyl chloride. The chloroacetylated product was modified to yield polymers with either quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts. The antimicrobial activity of the modified glycidyl methacrylate polymers has been examined against a variety of test microorganisms by the cut plug and the viable cell counting methods using shake flask of ten times diluted nutrient broth medium. All three polymers obtained were inhibitory to the growth of Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomones aeruginosa, Shigella sp. and Salmonella typhae) and Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and B. cereus) as well as the fungus (Trichophytun rubrum). It was found that the growth inhibitory effect varied according to the structure of the polymer and the composition of the active group and increased with increasing the concentration of the polymer. The tested polymers showed more antimicrobial activity against Gram negative bacteria and the fungus, whereas were less active against Gram positive bacteria.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase gene from Brevibacillus brevis CD162 and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) gene of Brevibacillus brevis CD162 was cloned into Escherichia coli using pUC19 as a vector. Determination of the nucleotide sequence showed the presence of an open reading frame of 2079 bp encoding a polypeptide of 693 amino acid residues, composed of a 20-amino acid signal sequence and a 673-amino acid mature enzyme. Neither a TATA- nor a TTGA-like sequence was observed within the cloned DNA fragment. However, the fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli by the lac promoter of pUC19 and 74% of the total activity was secreted into the fermentation medium. The amino acid sequence of the mature CGTase showed the highest homology of 86% to that of Bacillus sp. KC201. The CGTase purified to homogeneity from the recombinant E. coli exhibited the same properties as those of native CGTase from Brevibacillus brevis CD162 in terms of molecular mass, reaction conditions, stability and the production of cyclodextrins.
TI  - The extracytoplasmic function sigma factors: role and regulation.
AB  - Alternative sigma factors provide a means of regulating gene expression in response to various extracellular changes. One such class of sigma factors appears to control a variety of functions, including expression of heat-shock genes in Escherichia coli, biosynthesis of alginates and carotenoids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Myxococcus xanthus, respectively, iron uptake in E. coli and Pseudomonas spp., nickel and cobalt efflux in Alcaligenes europhus, plant pathogenicity in Pseudomonas syringae and synthesis of outer membrane proteins in Photobacterium sp. strain SS9. Most of these activities deal with extracytoplasmic functions, and such sigmas have been designated as ECF sigma factors. They have also been characterized in Mycobacteria as well as gram-positive bacteria such as Streptomyces coelicolor and Bacillus subtilus and the archaea Sulpholobus acidocaldarius. ECF factors belong to a subfamily of the sigma 70 class, based on their sequence conservation and function across bacterial species. The promoter consensus sequences recognized by the ECF factors are also highly conserved. In most of the cases, the activity of these factors is modulated by a cognate inner membrane protein that has been shown, both in E. coli and in P. aeruginosa, to act as an anti-sigma activity. This inner membrane protein is presumed to serve as a sensor and signalling molecule, allowing an adaptive response to specific environmental change. Presumably, an on-and-off switch of the anti-sigma activity leads to the release of the sigma factor and thereby to the co-ordinate transcription of the specific regulon it governs.
TI  - Molecular cloning of a Bacillus sp. KK-1 xylanase gene and characterization of the gene product.
AB  - A gene encoding cellulase-free xylanase was cloned from the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus sp. KK-1 into Escherichia coli and the gene product was purified from the recombinant E. coli. This xylanase gene, designated xylY, was composed of 1,302 base pairs and encoded a polypeptide of 434 amino acids. No similarity was found between the nucleotide sequence of the xylY gene and those reported for other xylanase genes. The deduced amino acid sequence was homologous to those of cellulases belonging to the beta-glycanase family D. The purified enzyme exhibited maximum activity at 55 degrees C but also lost 70% of this activity even after incubation for 30 min at 55 degrees C. Bacillus sp. KK-1 may have acquired the xylY gene by an interspecies gene transfer during adaptation to mesophilic environment.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the lactococcal plasmid-encoded type II restriction/modification system, LlaDII.
AB  - The LlaDII restriction/modification (R/M) system was found on the naturally occurring 8.9-kb plasmid pHW393 in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W39. A 2.4-kb PstI-EcoRI fragment inserted into the Escherichia coli-L. lactis shuttle vector pCI3340 conferred to L. lactis LM2301 and L. lactis SMQ86 resistance against representatives of the three most common lactococcal phage species: 936, P335, and c2. The LlaDII endonuclease was partially purified and found to recognize and cleave the sequence 5'-GC decreases NGC-3', where the arrow indicates the cleavage site. It is thus an isoschizomer of the commercially available restriction endonuclease Fnu4HI. Sequencing of the 2.4-kb PstI-EcoRI fragment revealed two open reading frames arranged tandemly and separated by a 105-bp intergenic region. The endonuclease gene of 543 bp preceded the methylase gene of 954 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence of the LlaDII R/M system showed high homology to that of its only sequenced isoschizomer, Bsp6I from Bacillus sp. strain RFL6, with 41% identity between the endonucleases and 60% identity between the methylases. The genetic organizations of the LlaDII and Bsp6I R/M systems are identical. Both methylases have two recognition sites (5'-GCGGC-3' and 5'-GCCGC-3') forming a putative stemloop structure spanning part of the presumed -35 sequence and part of the intervening region between the -35 and -10 sequences. Alignment of the LlaDII and Bsp6I methylases with other m5C methylases showed that the protein primary structures possessed the same organization.
TI  - Isolation of a beta-galactosidase-encoding gene from Bacillus licheniformis: purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Bacillus licheniformis beta-galactosidase gene, lacBl, was cloned on a 5.8-kb HindIII fragment into pBR322 and expressed by its own promoter in Escherichia coli. Deletion and complementation analysis showed that the enzyme-encoding region was located on a 4. 1-kb HindIII-ClaI fragment. The transcription region for the lacBl was identified on this fragment with promoter- and terminator-probe plasmids. The deduced sequence of 149 aa of the N-terminal part of lacBl showed aa sequence homology with beta-Gal from B. stearothermophilus, B. circulans, Haloferax alicantei, Clostridium perfringens, Arthrobacter sp.. No significant homology was shared with those found in the lacZ and lacS families. The recombinant beta-galactosidase (LacB1) was purified by FPLC. The molecular mass of the enzyme (80 kDa) and its optimal pH (5.7) and temperature (45 degrees C) were determined.
TI  - Polysaccharide lyase: molecular cloning of gellan lyase gene and formation of the lyase from a huge precursor protein in Bacillus sp. GL1.
AB  - A bacterium, Bacillus sp. GL1, produced constitutively the extracellular polysaccharide-degrading enzyme (gellan lyase) with a molecular mass of 140 kDa. A genomic DNA library of the bacterium was constructed in Escherichia coli using the cosmid vector, Charomid 9-36. The gene encoding the lyase was cloned by screening for a gellan-degrading phenotype in E. coli cells and the nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined. The gene contained an open reading frame consisting of 7425 base pairs coding a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 263 kDa. The polypeptide contained the same amino acid sequence as N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme and exhibited no homology with any previously published protein sequences. E. coli cells transformed with the gene exhibited gellan lyase activity and produced a protein with a molecular mass of about 260 kDa intracellularly. The protein was purified and shown to have the closely similar enzymatic properties to those of the native enzyme from Bacillus sp. GL1 with respect to optimal pH and temperature for activity, substrate specificity, and the mode of enzyme action. These results suggest that, in Bacillus sp. GL1, gellan lyase is first produced as a huge precursor protein (263 kDa) and then the protein is posttranslationally processed into extracellular mature form (140 kDa) through excising C-terminal peptide of about 120 kDa.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of an endoxylanase gene of Bacillus sp. in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A gene encoding an endoxylanase of Bacillus sp. was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The entire nucleotide sequence of a 1,620 bp SmaI fragment containing the endoxylanase gene was determined. The endoxylanase gene was 639 bp long and encoded 213 amino acids which showed up to 96% amino acid homology with other endoxylanases. The endoxylanase produced by E. coli harboring pKJX4 was purified by ion-exchange chromatography (DE-52 and CM-52) and its N-terminal sequence was determined to be Ala-Gly-Thr-Asp-Tyr-Trp-Gln-Asn-Trp-Thr-Asp-Gly-Gly-Gly-Thr. The endoxylanase expressed in E. coli was identical to that of the original Bacillus sp. whose molecular weight was approximately 20,400. Most of the produced endoxylanase was localized in the periplasmic space of E. coli. When the endoxylanase was reacted with 2% oat spelts xylan (w/v) at 40 degrees C for 10 h, the major product was xylobiose which is known to be a selective growth stimulant to one of the healthy intestinal microflora, Bifidobacteria.
TI  - Studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  - The specific growth rates of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the Food MicroModel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a Td, r = specific growth rate; T = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). The exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. A microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. The d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. The temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for B. thermosphacta and Y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as B. cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the d-value of C. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. The values of parameter a of the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. For all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. The lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. The change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. The influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in Chinese sausages. The d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of Enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from MRS cultures was 2.36. In refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. In this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.
TI  - Structure of the beta-galactosidase gene from Thermus sp. strain T2: expression in Escherichia coli and purification in a single step of an active fusion protein.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of both the bgaA gene, coding for a thermostable beta-galactosidase of Thermus sp. strain T2, and its flanking regions was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme predicts a polypeptide of 645 amino acids (Mr, 73,595). Comparative analysis of the open reading frames located in the flanking regions of the bgaA gene revealed that they might encode proteins involved in the transport and hydrolysis of sugars. The observed homology between the deduced amino acid sequences of BgaA and the beta-galactosidase of Bacillus stearothermophilus allows us to classify the new enzyme within family 42 of glycosyl hydrolases. BgaA was overexpressed in its active form in Escherichia coli, but more interestingly, an active chimeric beta-galactosidase was constructed by fusing the BgaA protein to the choline-binding domain of the major pneumococcal autolysin. This chimera illustrates a novel approach for producing an active and thermostable hybrid enzyme that can be purified in a single step by affinity chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, retaining the catalytic properties of the native enzyme. The chimeric enzyme showed a specific activity of 191,000 U/mg at 70 degrees C and a Km value of 1.6 mM with o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside as a substrate, and it retained 50% of its initial activity after 1 h of incubation at 70 degrees C.
TI  - Analysis of the gene encoding cyclomaltodextrinase from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. I-5 and characterization of enzymatic properties.
AB  - The gene encoding cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase) was cloned from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. I-5. The nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined and the physicochemical properties of the enzyme were investigated. The gene had an open reading frame of 559 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 64,884. The enzyme was purified to near homogeneity from Escherichia coli cells carrying a recombinant plasmid that contained the CDase gene. The enzyme hydrolyzed cyclomaltoheptaose (beta-CD) 13 times better than starch and 33 times better than pullulan, and it had transglycosylation activity. The enzyme also hydrolyzed acarbose, a pseudotetrasaccharide inhibitor of glucosidases. The enzyme was stabilized by Ca2+ and the activity was increased more than twofold in the presence of 5 mM EDTA. The optimum temperature of the enzyme was elevated from 40 to 50 degrees C by Ca2+ ion and the thermal activity was maintained more than 80% at 60 degrees C in the presence of Ca2+. Comparison of known amino acid sequences of several amylolytic enzymes with cyclomaltodextrinase activity, site-directed mutagenesis of the enzyme, and substrate specificity of the enzyme imply that the region between the third and the fourth conserved regions of the enzyme may play an important role in binding and degradation of cyclomaltodextrin.
TI  - Cloning of the thermostable phytase gene (phy) from Bacillus sp. DS11 and its overexpression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Phytase hydrolyzes phytate to release inorganic phosphate, which would decrease the addition of phosphorus to feedstuffs for monogastric animals and thus reduce environmental pollution. The gene encoding phytase from Bacillus sp. DS11 was cloned in Escherichia coli and its sequence determined. A 560-bp DNA fragment was used as a probe to screen the genomic library. It was obtained through PCR of Bacillus sp. DS11 chromosomal DNA and two oligonucleotide primers based on N-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified protein and the cyanogen bromide-cleaved 21-kDa fragment. The phy cloned was encoded by a 2.2-kb fragment. This gene comprises 1152 nucleotides and encodes a polypeptide of 383 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 41,808 Da. Phytase was produced to 20% content of total soluble proteins in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using the pET22b(+) vector with the inducible T7 promoter. This is the first nucleic sequence report on phytase from a bacterial strain.
TI  - The N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase encoded by the Bacillus subtilis 168 prophage SP beta.
AB  - Heat shock of Bacillus subtilis CU1147, a strain lysogenic for SP beta c2, a prophage with a thermosensitive repressor, results in phage induction and subsequent cell lysis. Cloning in Escherichia coli and sequencing of a DNA fragment of prophage SP beta led to the identification of blyA, the gene encoding a 367 amino acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of 39.6 kDa. Purified BlyA obtained from the E. coli clone exhibited an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase activity. Insertional mutagenesis confirmed that the latter enzyme was associated with SP beta-phage-mediated cell lysis. Analysis of the neighbouring sequence suggested that the two ORFs immediately downstream of blyA and belonging to the same operon encode polypeptides which may be involved in the release of the endolysin. The presence on the chromosomes of B. subtilis or related Bacillus spp. of other, similar genes, and their possible relationship, is discussed.
TI  - Strand compositional asymmetry in bacterial and large viral genomes.
AB  - Several bacterial genomes exhibit preference for G over C on the DNA leading strand extending from the origin of replication to the ter-region in the genomes of Escherichia coli, Mycoplasma genitalium, Bacillus subtilis, and marginally in Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori. Strand compositional asymmetry is not observed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. genome nor in the archaeal genomes of Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. A strong strand compositional asymmetry is observed in beta-type but not alpha- or gamma-type human herpesviruses featuring G > C downstream of oriL and C > G upstream of oriL. Dinucleotide relative abundances (i.e., dinucleotide representations normalized by the component nucleotide frequencies) are consonant with respect to the leading and lagging strands. Strand compositional asymmetry may reflect on differences in replication synthesis of the leading versus lagging strand, on differences between template and coding strand associated with transcription-coupled repair mechanisms, on differences in gene density between the two strands, on differences in residue and codon biases in relation to gene function, expression level, or operon organization, or on differences in single or context-dependent base mutational rates. The absence of strand asymmetry in the archaeal genomes may reflect the presence of multiple origins of replication.
TI  - Improved cloning vectors for Bifidobacterium spp.
AB  - The recombinant plasmids pDLI41, pDGA7 and pDCO7 were constructed by cloning in pDG7, a vector based on Bifidobacterium longum replicon pMB1, the following heterologous genes: Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase, Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase and Streptomyces sp. cholesterol oxidase. The hybrid plasmids efficiently transformed Bifidobacterium belonging to five different species. A novel Escherichia coli-Bifidobacterium set of shuttle vectors based on the replicon pMB1 (pLF5, pCLJ15, pSPEC1) featuring chloramphenicol, erythromycin and spectinomycin resistance genetic determinants as selection marker for bifidobacteria, was developed. The plasmid pTRE3, a derivative of pLF5, was the smallest (2.8 kb) Bifidobacterium vector, possessed a convenient multicloning site and presented high structural and segregational stability.
TI  - Unique organization of the dnaA region from Prochlorococcus marinus CCMP1375, a marine cyanobacterium.
AB  - In order to study DNA replication control elements in cyanobacteria we cloned and sequenced the dnaA gene from the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus. The dnaA gene is ubiquitous among bacteria and encodes the DNA replication initiation factor DnaA. The deduced amino acid sequence of the P. marinus DnaA protein shows highest similarity to the DnaA protein from the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Using a solid-phase DNA binding assay we demonstrated that both cyanobacterial DnaA proteins specifically recognize chromosomal origins, oriC, of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis in vitro. The genetic environment of dnaA is not conserved between the two cyanobacteria. Upstream of the P. marinus dnaA gene we identified a gene encoding a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport protein. The gor gene encoding glutathione reductase lies downstream of dnaA. Comparison of the genetic structure of dnaA regions from 15 representative bacteria shows that the pattern of genes flanking dnaA is not universally conserved among them.
TI  - Microbial production of hydrogen: an overview.
AB  - Production of hydrogen by anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, methylotrophs, and photosynthetic bacteria is possible. Anaerobic Clostridia are potential producers and immobilized C. butyricum produces 2 mol H2/mol glucose at 50% efficiency. Spontaneous production of H2 from formate and glucose by immobilized Escherichia coli showed 100% and 60% efficiencies, respectively. Enterobactericiae produces H2 at similar efficiency from different monosaccharides during growth. Among methylotrophs, methanogenes, rumen bacteria, and thermophilic archae, Ruminococcus albus, is promising (2.37 mol/mol glucose). Immobilized aerobic Bacillus licheniformis optimally produces 0.7 mol H2/mol glucose. Photosynthetic Rhodospirillum rubrum produces 4, 7, and 6 mol of H2 from acetate, succinate, and malate, respectively. Excellent productivity (6.2 mol H2/mol glucose) by co-cultures of Cellulomonas with a hydrogenase uptake (Hup) mutant of R. capsulata on cellulose was found. Cyanobacteria, viz., Anabaena, Synechococcus, and Oscillatoria sp., have been studied for photoproduction of H2. Immobilized A. cylindrica produces H2 (20 ml/g dry wt/h) continually for 1 year. Increased H2 productivity was found for Hup mutant of A. variabilis. Synechococcus sp. has a high potential for H2 production in fermentors and outdoor cultures. Simultaneous productions of oxychemicals and H2 by Klebseilla sp. and by enzymatic methods were also attempted. The fate of H2 biotechnology is presumed to be dictated by the stock of fossil fuel and state of pollution in future.
TI  - Results of quantitative cultures of urine by free catch and catheterization from  healthy adult horses.
AB  - Quantitative urine cultures were performed on 11 male and 11 female healthy adult horses. Urine was collected by free catch and catheterization using standard methods. Results showed that all samples collected by free catch contained less than 20,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. All samples collected by catheterization contained 500 CFU/mL or less. A significant difference was found between collection methods (P < .005), with catheterization having less contamination. In samples collected by free catch, females had significantly greater contamination than did males (P < .03). Predominant bacterial species isolated included Streptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp., Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus spp., Diptheroids sp., Proteus spp., and Enterococcus sp. Many samples contained multiple bacterial species. Bacterial isolates were representative of the normal bacterial flora of the equine urogenital tract. This paper establishes reference values for quantitative urine culture results in healthy adult horses to aid in the diagnosis of urinary tract infections.
TI  - A cysteine-dependent serine protease associated with the dormant spores of Bacillus cereus: purification of the protein and cloning of the corresponding gene.
AB  - Subtilisin-like serine protease, which is associated with the dormant spores of Bacillus cereus, was solubilized by washing the spores with 2 M KCl and purified to homogeneity by carbobenzoxy-D-phenylalanine-liganded affinity column chromatography and hydrophobic interaction column chromatography. Enzyme activity was completely inhibited by reagents for sulfhydryl groups such as HgCl2 as well as by conventional subtilisin inhibitors, suggesting the enzyme to be cysteine-dependent. The enzyme retained activity in 5 M urea at 4 degrees C for at least 2 months, and the specific activity was 50 times that of subtilisin BPN when measured for a common chromogenic substrate, carbobenzoxy-glycyl-glycyl-L-leucine p-nitroanilide. The gene encoding this protease was cloned in Escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed. The deduced amino acid sequence suggested that the protease is produced as a precursor comprising three portions; a signal sequence (28 amino acid residues), a prosequence (80 amino acid residues) and a mature enzyme (289 amino acid residues). The mature region of the enzyme had high similarity with a thermitase from Thermoactinomyces vulgaris (72% identity) and a thermostable alkaline protease from Thermoactinomyces sp. E79 (66% identity), which have the N-terminal sequence showing scarcely noticeable similarity with corresponding stretches of subtilisins and mercuric ion-sensitive free cysteine in the equivalent position of the primary structure.
TI  - Amino acid sequence and stereoselective hydrolytic reaction of an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from a Bacillus strain.
AB  - Bacillus sp. KSM-522 produces three different extracellular endo-1,4-beta-glucanases [EGs; Okoshi et al., Agric. Biol. Chem., 54, 83-89 (1990)]. Here, we report the molecular cloning and sequencing of the gene for the fourth EG (EG-IV) of the organism and the mechanism of its hydrolytic reaction. The structural gene contained an open reading frame of 1911 bp, corresponding to 636 amino acids, the amino acid sequence of which was very close to that of an EG of Clostridium cellulovorans, belonging to the cellulase family E2. The molecular mass of the extracellular mature enzyme (Ser26 through Lys636) was calculated to be 69,076 Da, a value close to the 69.2 kDa measured for the recombinant EG-IV expressed in Bacillus subtilis. The optimum pH and temperature for activity of the recombinant enzyme were pH 8.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. By 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl beta-D-cellotrioside by EG-IV proceeded with inversion of the anomeric configuration.
TI  - Thermostable tyrosine phenol-lyase of Symbiobacterium sp. SC-1: gene cloning, sequence determination, and overproduction in Escherichia coli.
AB  - During the screening for tyrosine phenol-lyase-producing thermophiles, we isolated an obligatory symbiotic thermophile, Symbiobacterium sp. SC-1, which grew only in coculture with Bacillus sp. SK-1. A gene encoding thermostable tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL) was cloned from the genomic DNA of the Symbiobacterium sp. SC-1 and the nucleotide sequence of the TPL structural gene was determined. The gene consists of 1374 base pairs encoding a polypeptide of 458 amino acid residues; the molecular mass of the enzyme subunit is estimated to be 52,196 Da. The structural gene of TPL was amplified by PCR, blunt-ended, and ligated into the NcoI-HindIII site of plasmid pTrc99A to construct an expression vector for the overproduction of the thermostable TPL. The level of thermostable TPL production was about 15% of the total soluble proteins of Escherichia coli extract. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from the E. coli extract with an overall yield of 48%.
TI  - Physical map of the Bacillus subtilis 166 genome: evidence for the inversion of an approximately 1900 kb continuous DNA segment, the translocation of an approximately 100 kb segment and the duplication of a 5 kb segment.
AB  - An I-CeuI-NotI-SfiI endonuclease map of the Bacillus subtilis 166 genome was constructed. It was almost identical to that of B. subtilis 168 except for the inversion of an approximately 1900 kb DNA segment, the translocation of an approximately 100 kb segment and the duplication of a 5 kb segment. Continuity of the inverted segment was investigated by direct measurement of the distances between the two genomic loci where I-SceI recognition sites were created in the 168 and the 166 genomes. Size difference of the I-SceI fragments between the two strains fully demonstrated the inversion of an approximately 1900 kb long 'continuous' DNA segment and the 'location' of the two inversion junctions in the genome. The 100 kb DNA segment including the lysogenic SP beta prophage was translocated close to one of the inversion junctions and was probably associated with the duplication of a 5 kb segment. These rearrangements are consistent with those indicated by genetic analyses.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - Mosquito larvicidal activity of transgenic Anabaena strain PCC 7120 expressing combinations of genes from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis.
AB  - Various combinations of the genes cryIVA (cry4A), cryIVD (cry11A), and p20 from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis were introduced into the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 by means of Escherichia coli-Anabaena shuttle vector pRL488p and were expressed under control of two tandem strong promoters, a cyanobacterial promoter (PpsbA) and an E. coli T7 promoter (PA1). Two of the clones carrying cryIVA plus cryIVD, one with p20 and one without p20, displayed toxicity against third-instar larvae of Aedes aegypti at levels greater than any level previously reported for transgenic cyanobacteria.
TI  - Bacterial flavohaemoglobins: a consensus sequence and identification of a discrete enterobacterial group and of further bacterial globins.
AB  - The amino acid sequences of haemoglobin-like proteins from the bacteria Alcaligenes eutrophus, Bacillus subtilis, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Escherichia coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vitreoscilla sp. and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied. Phylogenies based on distance and parsimony analysis showed that the eubacterial group can be easily distinguished from the other haemoglobin-like proteins. The construction of a consensus bacterial flavohaemoglobin based on the alignment of six bacterial and one yeast globins allowed the design of consensus primers to search for haemoglobin-like genes in other bacteria. PCR products of the expected size were found in Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Isolation, analysis, and expression of two genes from Thermoanaerobacterium sp. strain JW/SL YS485: a beta-xylosidase and a novel acetyl xylan esterase with cephalosporin C deacetylase activity.
AB  - The genes encoding acetyl xylan esterase 1 (axe1) and a beta-xylosidase (xylB) have been cloned and sequenced from Thermoanaerobacterium sp. strain JW/SL YS485. axe1 is located 22 nucleotides 3' of the xylB sequence. The identity of axe1 was confirmed by comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence to peptide sequence analysis data from purified acetyl xylan esterase 1. The xylB gene was identified by expression cloning and by sequence homology to known beta-xylosidases. Plasmids which independently expressed either acetyl xylan esterase 1 (pAct1BK) or beta-xylosidase (pXylo-1.1) were constructed in Escherichia coli. Plasmid pXylAct-1 contained both genes joined at a unique EcoRI site and expressed both activities. Substrate specificity, pH, and temperature optima were determined for partially purified recombinant acetyl xylan esterase 1 and for crude recombinant beta-xylosidase. Similarity searches showed that the axe1 and xylB genes were homologs of the ORF-1 and xynB genes, respectively, isolated from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum. Although the deduced sequence of the axe1 product had no significant amino acid sequence similarity to any reported acetyl xylan esterase sequence, it did have strong similarity to cephalosporin C deacetylase from Bacillus subtilis. Recombinant acetyl xylan esterase 1 was found to have thermostable deacetylase activity towards a number of acetylated substrates, including cephalosporin C and 7-aminocephalosporanic acid.
TI  - Expression of small RNAs by Bacillus sp. strain PS3 and B. subtilis cells during  sporulation.
AB  - A small RNA sequence identified in an rRNA-tRNA cluster from the thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain PS3 was examined. An oligonucleotide probe specific for the RNA bound to multiple restriction fragments in Bacillus sp. strain PS3 DNA, thus several copies of this sequence occur in its genome. Similar findings were observed using DNA from B. subtilis, B. stearothermophilus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Thermus thermophilus. This sequence apparently is widespread in the eubacteria. Northern analysis of RNA from sporulating Bacillus sp. strain PS3 and B. subtilis cells revealed RNA species homologous to the probe in both bacteria. Expression of the small RNA in B. subtilis depended on sigma H.
TI  - A Bacillus subtilis gene encoding a protein similar to nucleotide sugar transferases influences cell shape and viability.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis gene ypfP, which is located at 196 degrees on the genetic map,  shows similarity to both the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase gene of Cucumis sativus, which encodes a galactosyltransferase, and the murG genes of B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, which encode N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Cells containing a null mutation of ypfP are shorter and rounder than wild-type cells during growth in Luria-Bertani medium and glucose minimal medium. In addition, the mutant cells preferentially undergo lysis when grown on solid Luria-Bertani medium.
TI  - Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C: kinetic and stereochemical evidence for an interaction between arginine-69 and the phosphate group of phosphatidylinositol.
AB  - A new substrate analogue, (2R)-1,2-dipalmitoyloxypropanethiophospho-1-D-myo-inositol (DPsPI), has been used in a new, continuous assay for phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). DPsPI is superior to other substrate analogs that have been used for assaying PI-PLC since it is synthesized as a pure diastereomer and maintains both acyl chains of the natural substrate, dipalmitoylphosphatidylinositol (DPPI). The assay that has been developed using this new analogue has allowed us to elucidate detailed kinetic data so far lacking in the field. In addition, several mutants of PI-PLC were constructed and assayed. The results show that Arg-69 is essential for catalysis, since mutations at this position led to a 10(3)- 10(4)-fold decrease in activity with respect that of to the wild-type (WT) enzyme. An alanine mutant of Asp-67, a residue also found at the active site, displays activity similar to that of WT. We have also used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to analyze the structural integrity and conformational stability of the mutants. The results show that the overall global conformation of the enzyme is not perturbed by the mutants. The 15N-1H HSQC NMR spectrum of WT PI-PLC is also reported at 600 MHz. The stereoselectivity of the reaction toward the stereoisomers of another analogue, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-thiophospho-1-myo-inositol (DPPsI), was used to probe whether Arg-69 interacts with the phosphate moiety of the substrate. We have calculated that the WT enzyme shows a stereoselectivity ratio of 160000:1 in favor of the Rp isomer versus the Sp isomer. The R69K mutant displayed a significant 10(4)-fold relaxation of stereoselectivity. Our data support the role of Arg-69 in stabilizing the negative charge on the pentacoordinate phosphate in the transition state during catalysis.
TI  - Dihydrophencomycin methyl ester, a new phenazine derivative from a marine Streptomycete.
AB  - The novel 5,10-dihydrophencomycin methyl ester (4) and the known microbial metabolites (2-hydroxyphenyl)-acetamide (1), menaquinone MK9 (II, III, VIII, IX-H8) (2), and phencomycin (3a) were isolated from an unidentified marine Streptomyces sp. and the structures were elucidated by NMR methods. Compound 4 shows weak antibiotic activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Structure and expression of a pyrimidine gene cluster from the extreme thermophile Thermus strain ZO5.
AB  - On a 4.7-kbp HindIII clone of Thermus strain ZO5 DNA, complementing an aspartate  carbamoyltransferase mutation in Escherichia coli, we identified a cluster of four potential open reading frames corresponding to genes pyrR, and pyrB, an unidentified open reading frame named bbc, and gene pyrC. The transcription initiation site was mapped at about 115 nucleotides upstream of the pyrR translation start codon. The cognate Thermus pyr promoter also functions in heterologous expression of Thermus pyr genes in E. coli. In Thermus strain ZO5, pyrB and pyrC gene expression is repressed three- to fourfold by uracil and increased twofold by arginine. Based on the occurrence of several transcription signals in the Thermus pyr promoter region and strong amino acid sequence identities (about 60%) between Thermus PyrR and the PyrR attenuation proteins of two Bacillus sp., we propose a regulatory mechanism involving transcriptional attenuation to control pyr gene expression in Thermus. In contrast to pyr attenuation in Bacillus spp., however, control of the Thermus pyr gene cluster would not involve an antiterminator structure but would involve a translating ribosome for preventing formation of the terminator RNA hairpin. The deduced amino acid sequence of Thermus strain ZO5 aspartate carbamoyltransferase (ATCase; encoded by pyrB) exhibits the highest similarities (about 50% identical amino acids) with ATCases from Pseudomonas sp. For Thermus strain ZO5 dihydroorotase (DHOase; encoded by pyrC), the highest similarity scores (about 40% identity) were obtained with DHOases from B. caldolyticus and Bacillus subtilis. The enzyme properties of ATCase expressed from truncated versions of the Thermus pyr gene cluster in E. coli suggest that Thermus ATCase is stabilized by DHOase and that the translation product of bbc plays a role in feedback inhibition of the ATCase-DHOase complex.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase from Pseudomonas sp. WO24.
AB  - A dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (DCP) activity was detected in cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas sp. WO24. After purification and characterization the enzyme was found to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE, and had a molecular mass of 74,000 Da by SDS-PAGE and 72,000 Da by gel filtration, indicating that it is monomeric. The isoelectric point was 5.2 and optimum pH was 6.5-7.0. It showed a specific activity of 780 mumol/min/mg, which is the highest of the values shown by known enzymes. The enzyme hydrolyzed angiotensin I to angiotensin II and sequentially released Phe-Arg and Ser-Pro from the C-terminus bradykinin. The DCP could not cleave imido-bonds, Gly-Gly bonds, or tripeptides. The enzymatic activity was completely inhibited by 0.001 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM O-phenanthroline, but it was not affected by general serine and cysteine protease inhibitors. Addition of Zn2+ completely restored the original activity of the inactivated DCP treated with EDTA. These results suggest that this enzyme is a zinc metalloprotease. The characteristics of the purified enzyme are slightly different from those of the DCPs from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Corynebacterium equi, and considerably from those of the DCP from Bacillus pumilus.
TI  - Lactose-induced expression of Bacillus sp. TS-23 amylase gene in Escherichia coli regulated by a T7 promoter.
AB  - Bacillus sp. TS-23 amylase gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pET23(+) transcription vector. Lactose induction of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harbouring this recombinant plasmid resulted in the extracellular production of gene products. By the addition of 20 mmol l-1 lactose, the amylase activity of fermentation broth had a specific activity of 21 U mg-1 of protein.
TI  - Three Bacillus cereus bacteriophage endolysins are unrelated but reveal high homology to cell wall hydrolases from different bacilli.
AB  - The ply genes encoding the endolysin proteins from Bacillus cereus phages Bastille, TP21, and 12826 were identified, cloned, and sequenced. The endolysins could be overproduced in Escherichia coli (up to 20% of total cellular protein), and the recombinant proteins were purified by a two-step chromatographical procedure. All three enzymes induced rapid and specific lysis of viable cells of several Bacillus species, with highest activity on B. cereus and B. thuringiensis. Ply12 and Ply21 were experimentally shown to be N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases (EC 3.5.1.28). No apparent holin genes were found adjacent to the ply genes. However, Ply21 may be endowed with a signal peptide which could play a role in timing of cell lysis by the cytoplasmic phage endolysin. The individual lytic enzymes (PlyBa, 41.1 kDa; Ply21, 29.5 kDa, Ply12, 27.7 kDa) show remarkable heterogeneity, i.e., their amino acid sequences reveal only little homology. The N-terminal part of Ply21 was found to be almost identical to the catalytic domains of a Bacillus sp. cell wall hydrolase (CwlSP) and an autolysin of B. subtilis (CwlA). The C terminus of PlyBa contains a 77-amino-acid sequence repeat which is also homologous to the binding domain of CwlSP. Ply12 shows homology to the major autolysins from B. subtilis and E. coli. Comparison with database sequences indicated a modular organization of the phage lysis proteins where the enzymatic activity is located in the N-terminal region and the C-termini are responsible for specific recognition and binding of Bacillus peptidoglycan. We speculate that the close relationship of the phage enzymes and cell wall autolysins is based upon horizontal gene transfer among different Bacillus phages and their hosts.
TI  - Structure-function relationships within the peptide deformylase family. Evidence  for a conserved architecture of the active site involving three conserved motifs and a metal ion.
AB  - Thermus thermophilus peptide deformylase was characterized. Its enzymatic properties as well as its organization in domains proved to share close resemblances with those of the Escherichia coli enzyme despite few sequence identities. In addition to the HEXXH signature sequence of the zinc metalloprotease family, a second short stretch of strictly conserved amino acids was noticed, EGCLS, the cysteine of which corresponds to the third zinc ligand. The study of site-directed mutants of the E. coli deformylase shows that the residues of this stretch are crucial for the structure and/or catalytic efficiency of the active enzyme. Both aforementioned sequences were used as markers of the peptide deformylase family in protein sequence databases. Seven sequences coming from Haemophilus influenzae, Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilus and Synechocystis sp. could be identified. The characterization of the product of the open reading frame from B. stearothermophilus confirmed that it actually corresponded to a peptide deformylase with properties similar to those of the E. coli enzyme. Alignment of the nine peptide deformylase sequences showed that, in addition to the two above sequences, only a third one, GXGXAAXQ, is strictly conserved. This motif is also located in the active site according to the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli enzyme. Site-directed variants of E. coli peptide deformylase showed the involvement of the corresponding residues for maintaining an active and stable enzyme. Altogether, these data allow us to propose that the three identified conserved motifs of peptide deformylases build up the active site around a metal ion. Finally, an analysis of the location of the other conserved residues, in particular of the hydrophobic ones, was performed using the three-dimensional model of the E. coli enzyme. This enables us to suggest that all bacterial peptide deformylases adopt a constant overall tertiary structure.
TI  - A gene encoding for an alpha-amylase from thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain TS-23  and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - An alpha-amylase gene from Bacillus sp. strain TS-23 was cloned and expressed by  using its own promoter on the recombinant plasmid pTS917 in Escherichia coli. A cell fractionation experiment revealed that approximately 60% of the amylase activity was in the periplasmic space. Analysis and activity staining of the concentrated supernatant fraction by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed an apparent protein band with a mol. wt of approximately 65,000. The amylase gene (amyA) consisted of an open reading frame of 1,845 bp encoding a protein of 613 amino acids with a calculated mol. wt of 69,543. The predicted amino acid sequence showed high homology with Bacillus species, E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium alpha-amylases. Deletion of 96 amino acids from the C-terminal portion of the amylase did not result in the loss of amylolytic activity. The truncated amylase, deletion of the first 50 amino acids from the N-terminus, was overexpressed in E. coli system and refolded to yield an activable enzyme.
TI  - A novel transporter involved in cobalt uptake.
AB  - Cobalt is an essential component of a low molecular-mass nitrile hydratase (L-NHase) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1. We have found a new gene, nhlF, in the DNA region sandwiched between nhlBA encoding L-NHase and amdA encoding amidase, which are involved in the degradation of nitriles. The product of nhlF, NhlF, shows a significant sequence similarity with those of hoxN from Alcaligenes eutrophus, hupN from Bradyrhizobium japonicum, nixA from Helicobacter pylori, and ureH from Bacillus sp., which are considered to be involved in nickel uptake into these cells. Sequence and hydropathy plot analyses have shown that NhlF encodes a 352-amino acid (aa) protein with eight hydrophobic putative membrane-spanning domains. nhlF expression in R. rhodochrous ATCC 12674 and Escherichia coli JM109 confers uptake of 57Co in their cells, but not of 63Ni. The expression of both nhlF and nhlBA in R. rhodochrous ATCC 12674 exhibited higher NHase activity than nhlBA expression. These findings together with the inhibitory effect by uncouplers (CCCP and SF6847) for the cobalt uptake suggest that NhlF mediates the cobalt transport into the cell energy-dependently finally to provide L-NHase.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of heavy metals resistant bacteria from Lagos Lagoon.
AB  - A total of 228 bacteria with an ability to resist toxic heavy metals were isolated from 8 selected sites of the Lagos Lagoon. The bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Streptococcus sp., Moraxella sp., Escherichia coli, Proteus sp., Klebsiella sp. and Salmonella sp. The heavy metals to which resistance was recorded were mercury, lead, zinc, cobalt, copper and chromium. The lagoon sites from which the highest number of resistant bacteria were isolated were Marina and Ebute-Ero. The heavy metal to which most bacteria were resistant was cobalt, while the least was chromium. The significance of the result is discussed in relation to the Nigerian environment and human health.
TI  - Risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  - The epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994, the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in England and Wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). Salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and S. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. Small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, Clostridium perfringens in four, Bacillus cereus in two, and Campylobacter sp and Escherichia coli in one each. No pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. Outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. The commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. Salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight outbreaks. Raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. Inappropriate storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. Outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. Public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
TI  - Isocitrate dehydrogenase from Thermus aquaticus YT1: purification of the enzyme and cloning, sequencing, and expression of the gene.
AB  - Isocitrate dehydrogenase from an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus aquaticus YT1, was purified to homogeneity, and the gene was cloned by using a degenerate oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal sequence. The gene consisted of a single open reading frame of 1,278 bp preceded by a Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding site, and a terminator-like sequence was detected downstream of the open reading frame. The G+C content of the coding region was 65%, and that of the third nucleotide of the codons was 93%. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed a relatively low level of similarity to the counterpart from T. thermophilus (35% identity) but showed higher levels of similarity (54 to 69% identity) to the other bacterial counterparts so far reported, including those from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Vibrio sp., and Anabaena sp. The cloned gene was highly expressed in E. coli and easily purified to homogeneity by heat treatment (70 degrees C, 30 min) and DEAE column chromatography to yield approximately 10 mg of protein from 1 g of wet cells. The recombinant enzyme showed high thermostability and almost the same heat denaturation profile as the intact enzyme purified from the thermophile cells, implying that the recombinant protein has the same structure as the intact one.
TI  - Sequence and transcriptional analysis of clpX, a class-III heat-shock gene of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of clpX, which is localized between the tig (trigger factor) and the lon (ATP-dependent protease) genes at 245 degrees on the standard Bacillus subtilis (Bs) genetic map, was determined. The putative clpX gene codes for a 46-kDa protein of 421 amino acid (aa) residues. A comparison of the deduced aa sequence with those of the recently described bacterial clpX gene products from Synechocystis sp., Escherichia coli (Ec), Haemophilus influenzae and Azotobacter vinelandii revealed strong similarities. However, in contrast to Ec, clpX and clpP of Bs are located at different loci on the chromosome and are transcribed as monocistronic genes. A heat-inducible sigma A-like promoter was mapped upstream of the clpX structural gene, but no CIRCE element, characteristic of class-I heat-shock genes (e.g., groESL and dnaK), was found between the transcriptional and translational start sites. Although the majority of the heat-inducible general stress genes in Bs are under the control of the alternative sigma factor, sigma B, the heat induction of clpX appears to be sigma B-independent. The latter indicates that clpX belongs to class-III heat-inducible genes.
TI  - Organization of the Bacillus subtilis 168 chromosome between kdg and the attachment site of the SP beta prophage: use of Long Accurate PCR and yeast artificial chromosomes for sequencing.
AB  - Within the Bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, the region between lysA and ilvA was assigned to our laboratory. In this report we present the sequence of the last 36 kb of this region, between the kdg operon and the attachment site of the SP beta prophage. A two-step strategy was used for the sequencing. In the first step, total chromosomal DNA was cloned in phage M13-based vectors and the clones carrying inserts from the target region were identified by hybridization with a cognate yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) from our collection. Sequencing of the clones allowed us to establish a number of contigs. In the second step the contigs were mapped by Long Accurate (LA) PCR and the remaining gaps closed by sequencing of the PCR products. The level of sequence inaccuracy due to LA PCR errors appeared to be about 1 in 10,000, which does not affect significantly the final sequence quality. This two-step strategy is efficient and we suggest that it can be applied to sequencing of longer chromosomal regions. The 36 kb sequence contains 38 coding sequences (CDSs), 19 of which encode unknown proteins. Seven genetic loci already mapped in this region, xpt, metB, ilvA, ilvD, thyB, dfrA and degR were identified. Eleven CDSs were found to display significant similarities to known proteins from the data banks, suggesting possible functions for some of the novel genes: cspD may encode a cold shock protein; bcsA, the first bacterial homologue of chalcone synthase; exol, a 5' to 3' exonuclease, similar to that of DNA polymerase I of Escherichia coli; and bsaA, a stress-response-associated protein. The protein encoded by yplP has homology with the transcriptional NifA-like regulators. The arrangement of the genes relative to possible promoters and terminators suggests 19 potential transcription units.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis Ffh, a homologue of mammalian SRP54, can intrinsically bind to  the precursors of secretory proteins.
AB  - We analyzed the binding activity of B. subtilis Ffh to the precursors of secretory proteins by purifying mature and precursor proteins of beta-lactamase derived from pUC18 and its derivatives, of which the signal peptide region was replaced with that of E. coli OmpA, B. subtilis AprE, PBP5* or an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. #1011 CGTase. Each of them was mixed with purified B. subtilis Ffh in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC). The tested precursor proteins, including those of E. coli, of which the signal sequences differ from those of B. subtilis in the number of charged amino acids and hydrophobicity, cross-linked with Ffh, whereas mature proteins did not. The addition of scRNA, the B. subtilis counterpart of mammalian SRP 7S RNA, into the mixture did not affect the complex formation. These findings suggest that B. subtilis Ffh intrinsically binds to several precursor proteins.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the groEL gene from the alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125 and reactivation of thermally inactivated alpha-glucosidase by recombinant GroEL.
AB  - The groEL gene of the alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125 was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. The groEL gene encoded a polypeptide of 544 amino acids and was preceded by the incomplete groES gene, lacking its 5'-end. The sequence of the derived amino acids was 87.5% identical to that of B. subtilis, 85.4% identical to that of B. stearothemophilus, and 60.9% identical to that of E. coli. The GroEL protein was expressed in E. coli. Purified GroEL protected yeast alpha-glucosidase from irreversible aggregation at a high temperature and the addition of Mg-ATP was essential for reactivation of the alpha-glucosidase. The addition of E. coli GroES increased recovery of the enzyme activity, indicating that C-125 GroEL could function in coordination with E. coli GroES.
TI  - A cellulase gene from a new alkalophilic Bacillus sp. (strain N186-1). Its cloning, nucleotide sequence and expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Several alkalophilic Bacillus spp. strains were selected for their capacity to produce alkaline cellulases. Culture supernatants of these strains showed optimal cellulase activities between pH 8 and 9 and they were stable from pH 6 to pH 12. A cellulase gene (celB1) from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain N186-1 was cloned in Escherichia coli using polymerase chain reaction techniques. The cloned gene was present in a 2.539-bp HindIII fragment and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The coding sequence showed an open-reading frame encoding 389 amino acids. The amino acid sequence, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, permitted us to include it in family 5 (or A) of the glycosyl hydrolases. The complete open-reading frame of celB1 was cloned in the plasmid pET-11d and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), in which a protein of 39 kDa was obtained in the cytoplasm; however, no endoglucanase activity was detected. A second construction in pET-12a allowed the production of a 39-kDa protein located in the periplasmic space of E. coli that had endoglucanase activity. The protein produced has optimal activity at pH 7 and 50 degrees C and it retains more than 70% of its activity after incubation for 1 h at pH 12.
TI  - Organization of the XYL genes in a thermophilic Bacillus species.
AB  - The organization of the genes involved in xylose catabolism in a thermophilic Bacillus sp. LW2 was found to be different from that of mesophiles such as B. subtilis and Escherichia coli. We have reported previously the cloning and characterization of the xylose isomerase gene (xylA) from this thermophilic Bacillus sp. A xylose transport permease gene (xylP) was located immediately upstream of xylA. This gene encoded a hydrophobic protein (392 amino acids) with a calculated molecular weight of 42,307. Further upstream of xylP, another related gene xylO encoding a sugar transport ATP-binding protein was observed. A xylulose kinase gene (xylB) was identified downstream of xylA. Its open reading frame extended up to 1122 bp and represented a part (372 aa) of the enzyme. The order of the xyl genes in the thermophilic Bacillus sp. is therefore 5'-xylO (ATP-binding protein)-xylP (xylose permease)-xylA (xylose isomerase)-xylB (xylulose kinase)-3'. The polarity of expression of these four genes was found to be unidirectional from xylO to xylB.
TI  - Sequence of the gene encoding a highly thermostable neutral proteinase from Bacillus sp. strain EA1: expression in Escherichia coli and characterisation.
AB  - The gene for a highly thermostable neutral proteinase (Npr) was isolated from Bacillus sp. strain EA1 by the polymerase chain reaction using consensus primers based on the sequences of npr genes from related species. The gene was sequenced and shown to be closely related to a neutral proteinase gene from Bacillus caldolyticus strain YP-T; the mature form of the enzyme differing by only a single amino acid. Enzyme samples were prepared from both the native organisms and also from recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the two npr genes. The proteinase from strain EA1 was shown to be significantly more thermostable than that from B. caldolyticus and that this difference is the result of a single amino acid substitution which is situated proximal to a region of the enzyme known to be crucial to conferring thermal stability. The phylogenetic relationship of EA1 to other Bacilli is also described.
TI  - Variation in sessile microflora during biofilm formation on AISI-304 stainless steel coupons.
AB  - Coupons of stainless steel type AISI-304 were exposed to the industrial cooling system of a petrochemical plant fed by seawater from the Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in order to study the in situ formation of biofilms. Bacteria, microalgae and fungi were detected on the coupons as soon as 48 h after exposure. Their respective numbers were determined at times 48, 96 and 192 h and over the following 8 weeks. Aerobic, anaerobic and sulfate-reducing bacteria were quantified according to the technique of the most probable number, and fungi by the pour plate technique. The number of microorganisms present in the forming biofilm varied over the experimental period, reaching maximal levels of 14 x 10(11) cells cm-2, 30 x 10(13) cells cm-2, 38 x 10(11) cells cm-2 and 63 x 10(5) cells cm-2, respectively, for aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria and fungi, and the dynamics of this variation depended on the group of microorganisms. Bacillus sp, Escherichia coli, Serratia sp and Pseudomonas putrefaciens were identified among the aerobic bacteria isolated. Additionally, microalgae and bacteria of the genus Gallionella were also detected. Nonetheless, no evidence of corrosion was found on the stainless steel type AISI-304 coupons over the experimental period.
TI  - Cloning of a Bacillus sp. BP-23 gene encoding a xylanase with high activity against aryl xylosides.
AB  - The xynB gene encoding a xylanase from the recently isolated Bacillus sp. strain  BP-23 has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme produced in this host shows a molecular size of 41 kDa and a pI of 4.5. The pH and temperature at which the highest activity was found were 5.5 and 50 degrees C respectively. Crude xylanase B showed activity on xylan, aryl xylosides, xylotetraose and xylotriose, while xylobiose was not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. Xylanase B showed high specific activity on aryl xylosides, probably as a result of the transxylosidase activity detected.
TI  - Cloning of a cluster of chitinase genes from Aeromonas sp. No. 10S-24.
AB  - A gene encoding chitinases from Aeromonas sp. No. 10S-24 was cloned into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha using pUC19, and its nucleotides were sequenced. The chitinase gene was clustered in ORFs (open reading frame) 1 to 4, in a 8-kb fragment of DNA. ORF-1 consisted of 1608 bp encoding 535 amino acid residues, and ORF-2 consisted of 1425 bp encoding 474 amino acid residues. ORF-3 was 1617 bp long and encodes a protein consisting of 538 amino acids. ORF-4 encodes 287 amino acids of the N-terminal region. The amino acid sequences of ORF-1 and ORF-3 share sequence homology with chitinase D from Bacillus circulans, and chitinase A and B from Streptomyces lividans. The amino acid sequence of ORF-2 shared sequence homology with chitinase II from Aeromonas sp. No. 10S-24, and chitinase from Saccharopolyspora erythraea. A region of the sequence starting from Ala-28 of the amino acid sequence of ORF-3 coincided with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of chitinase III from Aeromonas sp. No. 10S-24.
TI  - A ribosomal protein from Thermus thermophilus is homologous to a general shock protein.
AB  - The gene encoding the ribosomal protein from Thermus thermophilus, TL5, which binds to the 5S rRNA, has been cloned and sequenced. The codon usage shows a clear preference for G/C rich codons that is characteristic for many genes in thermophilic bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 206 residues. The sequence of TL5 shows a strong similarity to a general shock protein from Bacillus subtilis, named CTC. The protein CTC is homologous in its N-terminal part to the 5S rRNA binding protein, L25, from E coli. An alignment of the TL5, CTC and L25 sequences displays a number of residues that are totally conserved. No clear sequence similarity was found between TL5 and other proteins which are known to bind to 5S rRNA. The evolutionary relationship of a heat shock protein in mesophiles and a ribosomal protein in thermophilic bacteria as well as a possible role of TL5 in the ribosome are discussed.
TI  - An aspartate aminotransferase from an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus HB8.
AB  - The aspartate aminotransferase gene (AspAT, EC 2.6.1.1) of an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus HB8, was cloned and sequenced, and its gene product was overproduced. The purified T. thermophilus AspAT was stable up to about 80 degrees C at neutral pH. T. thermophilus AspAT was strictly specific for acidic amino acid substrates, such as aspartate, glutamate, and the respective keto acids. The gene coding for T. thermophilus AspAT showed that it comprised 1,155 bp with a high G+C content (70 mol%), and encoded a 385-residue protein with a molecular weight of 42,050. The amino acid sequence of T. thermophilus AspAT deduced from its gene showed about 15, 46, and 29% homology with those from Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp. YM-2, and Sulfolobus solfataricus, respectively. When the amino acid sequence of T. thermophilus AspAT was compared with that of E. coli AspAT, the number of Cys was found to have decreased from 5 to 1, that of Asn from 23 to 9, that of Gln from 16 to 8, and that of Asp from 20 to 13, all of which are known to be relatively labile at high temperatures. Conversely, the number of Pro was increased from 15 to 25, Arg from 22 to 32, and Glu 27 to 37. As shown by the E. coli AspAT structure, there was a marked tendency for the extra prolyl residues to be located around the surface of the molecule. This was quite different from that in the case of RecA protein, which shows an increased number of prolyl residues in the interior of its molecule. Different strategies of different proteins as to prolyl contribution to thermostability have been suggested. Despite the high degree of conservation of active-site residues, Arg292 in E. coli AspAT, which interacts with the distal carboxylate of the substrate, was not found in T. thermophilus AspAT. Arg89 may complement the function of Arg292.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the uricase gene from Bacillus sp. TB-90.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the uricase gene from the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus sp. TB-90 was determined. The primary structure of the uricase deduced from the nucleotide sequence comprised 332 amino acids, with a total molecular mass of 37,994 Da. The molecular mass of the subunit of the uricase produced by the transformant of Escherichia coli agreed well with this value. However, the molecular mass of a subunit of the uricase produced by Bacillus sp. TB-90 was found to be 34,000 Da by SDS-PAGE. The difference between these molecular masses was attributed to processing of the C-terminal 13 amino acid residue in Bacillus sp. TB-90. Comparison of the enzymatic properties of both uricases showed that the thermostability of the uricase produced by the transformant was enhanced by about 10 degrees C in comparison to that produced by Bacillus sp. TB-90.
TI  - Characterization of a bifunctional cellulase and its structural gene. The cell gene of Bacillus sp. D04 has exo- and endoglucanase activity.
AB  - Bacillus sp. D04 secreted a bifunctional cellulase that had a molecular weight of 35,000. This cellulase degraded Cm-cellulose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside, and avicel PH101. Based on the high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the degradation products, this cellulase randomly cleaved internal beta-1, 4-glycosidic bonds in cellotetraose and cellopentaose as an endoglucanase. It also hydrolyzed the aglycosidic bond in p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside and cleaved avicel to cellobiose as an exoglucanase. Cellobiose competitively inhibited the p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside degrading activity but not Cm-cellulose degrading activity. Ten mM p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibited p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside degrading activity completely, but Cm-cellulose degrading activity incompletely. Cm-cellulose increased p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside degrading activity, and vice versa, whereas methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobiose strongly inhibited p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside degrading activity. The cellulase gene (cel gene), 1461 base pairs, of Bacillus sp. D04 was cloned. The nucleotide sequence of the cel gene was highly homologous to those of Bacillus subtilis DLG and B. subtilis BSE616. The cel gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its product was purified. The substrate specificity and substrate competition pattern of the purified recombinant cellulase were the same as those of the purified cellulase from Bacillus sp. D04. These results suggest that a single polypeptide cellulase had both endo- and exoglucanase activities and each activity exists in a separate site.
TI  - 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase is conserved among different phylogenic kingdoms.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that maize (Zea mays) 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM-i) is not related to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase. With the aid of specific anti-maize PGAM-i antibodies, we demonstrate here the presence of a closely related PGAM-i in other plants. We also describe the isolation and sequencing of a cDNA-encoding almond (Prunus amygdalus) PGAM-i that further demonstrates this relationship among plant PGAM-i. A search of the major databases for related sequences allowed us to identify some novel PGAM-i from different sources: plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Antithamniom sp.), monera (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium) and animals (Caenorhabditis elegans). All of these amino acid sequences share a high degree of homology with plant PGAM-i. These observations suggest that the PGAM-i from several biological kingdoms constitute a family of protein different from other proteins with related enzymatic function and arose from a common ancestral gene that has diverged throughout its evolution.
TI  - Construction, purification, and properties of a truncated alkaline endoglucanase  from Bacillus sp. KSM-635.
AB  - Part of a 2.4-kb DNA fragment that encoded the amino-terminal 584 residues (65 kDa) of an alkaline endoglucanase from Bacillus sp. KSM-635 (941 amino acid residues; 105 kDa) was spontaneously deleted during subcloning of the fragment. The remaining 1.1-kb insert of the deleted plasmid encoded amino acids from Ala228 to Leu584 of the enzyme. However, Escherichia coli HB101 cells harboring this plasmid produced an active endoglucanase. After addition of a termination codon, TAA, immediately downstream of the codon for Leu584, the 1.1-kb fragment was inserted into an expression vector, pHSP64. The resultant plasmid was introduced into Bacillus subtilis ISW1214 for extracellular production of the truncated endoglucanase. The enzyme was then purified to homogeneity from a culture of the recombinant B. subtilis cells. Amino-terminal sequencing of the enzyme showed that the enzyme consisted of 7 amino acid residues encoded by the vector and 357 amino acid residues encoded by the truncated gene, with a molecular mass of 40.2 kDa. The purified enzyme was very active against carboxymethylcellulose and its pH and temperature profiles were almost identical to those of the enzyme produced by Bacillus sp. KSM-635.
TI  - Genetic structure of the dnaA region of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced the dnaA region of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, a bacterium with a light-dependent cell cycle. The dnaA gene product, DnaA, is the central factor for replication initiation in bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the cyanobacterial dnaA gene is 45% identical to DnaA of Bacillus subtilis and fits very well into the homology pattern of the known eubacterial DnaA proteins. The genetic environment of the Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 dnaA gene is completely different from the one in other eubacteria. An open reading frame of unknown function, orf134, was detected upstream of dnaA. The purT gene homolog encoding the glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase T starts about 200 bp away from this open reading frame in the opposite direction. Downstream of the dnaA gene we detected the start of the psbDC operon, which codes for the photosystem II reaction center proteins D2 and CP43 that are involved in the positioning of chlorophyll a.
TI  - [Gene technology to overproduce the enzymes useful as diagnostic reagents].
AB  - We cloned the genes encoding the microbial enzymes described below and discussed  the possibility as the diagnostic reagents: Creatinase(CR) and sarcosine oxidase(SOX) are useful for a diagnostic measurement of creatinine in combination with creatinase. Bacillus sp. B-0618 produces both CR and SOX enzymes when grown in the presence of an inducer, choline chloride. We cloned these two genes encoding CR and SOX by using recombinant DNA techniques. We found that the SOX-encoding gene is located upstream from the CR-encoding gene. When the CR- and SOX-encoding genes were independently inserted into the pUC-based vector and introduced into Escherichia coli, the transformants produced 15.5-fold more CR and 50-fold more SOX than Bacillus sp. B-0618, respectively, in the absence of the inducer. Although the Bacillus SOX is a flavoprotein, we created an FAD-free SOX by site-directed DNA mutagenesis. The mutant protein no longer expressed the SOX activity. Cholesterol esterase is useful for a diagnostic measurement of total cholesterol in combination with cholesterol oxidase. We cloned a gene encoding the cholesterol esterase enzyme. When the gene was introduced into the non-producing Streptomyces strain, the transformant produced the cholesterol esterase. Phospholipase A2 is a diverse family of enzymes that hydrolyze the sn-2 fatty acyl ester bond of phosphoglycerides producing free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. The enzymes are present in pancreatic juice and in the venoms of snakes and bees, where they serve digestive functions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning and DNA sequencing of xyaA, a gene encoding an endo-beta-1,4-xylanase from an alkalophilic Bacillus strain (N137).
AB  - The gene xyaA encoding an alkaline endo-beta 1,4-xylanase from an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain (N137) isolated in our laboratory was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a 1,656-bp DNA fragment containing xyaA was determined, revealing one open reading frame of 993 bp that encodes a xylanase (XyaA) of 39 kDa. This xylanase lacks a typical putative signal peptide, yet the protein is found in the Bacillus culture supernatant. In Escherichia coli, the active protein is located mainly in the periplasmic space. The xylanase activity of the cloned XyaA is an endo-acting enzyme that shows optimal activity at pH 8 and 40 degrees C. This activity is stable at a pH between 6 and 11. Incubations of XyaA at 40 degrees C for 1 h destroyed 45% of the activity.
TI  - A new alkaline serine protease from alkalophilic Bacillus sp.: cloning, sequencing, and characterization of an intracellular protease.
AB  - To obtain a new serine protease from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. NKS-21, shotgun cloning was carried out. As a result, a new protease gene was obtained. It encoded an intracellular serine protease (ISP-1) in which there was no signal sequence. The molecular weight was 34,624. The protease showed about 50% homology with those of intracellular serine proteases (ISP-1) from Bacillus subtilis, B. polymyxa, and alkalophilic Bacillus sp. No. 221. The amino acid residues that form the catalytic triad, Ser, His and Asp, were completely conserved in comparison with subtilisins (the extracellular proteases from Bacillus). The cloned intracellular protease was expressed in Escherichia coli, and its purification and characterization were carried out. The enzyme showed stability under alkaline condition at pH 10 and tolerance to surfactants. The cloned ISP-1 digested well nucleoproteins, clupein and salmin, for the substrates.
TI  - DNA restriction-modification systems mediate plasmid maintenance.
AB  - Two plasmid-carried restriction-modification (R-M) systems, EcoRI (from pMB1 of Escherichia coli) and Bsp6I (from pXH13 of Bacillus sp. strain RFL6), enhance plasmid segregational stability in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. Inactivation of the endonuclease or the presence of the methylase in trans abolish the stabilizing activity of the R-M systems. We propose that R-M systems mediate plasmid segregational stability by postsegregational killing of plasmid-free cells. Plasmid-encoded methyltransferase modifies host DNA and thus prevents its digestion by the restriction endonuclease. Plasmid loss entails degradation and/or dilution of the methylase during cell growth and appearance of unmethylated sites in the chromosome. Double-strand breaks, introduced at these sites by the endonuclease, eventually cause the death of the plasmid-free cells. Contribution to plasmid stability is a previously unrecognized biological role of the R-M systems.
TI  - Cloning and analysis of the plasmid-borne genes encoding the Bsp6I restriction and modification enzymes.
AB  - The Bsp6I restriction and modification (R-M) system has been localized on the plasmid pXH13, naturally occurring in the Bacillus sp. strain RFL6. The genes coding for the Bsp6I R-M system, a Fnu4HI isoschizomer recognizing the sequence GCNGC, have been cloned in Escherichia coli by two steps. The nucleotide sequence of a 2126-bp region containing the genes for restriction endonuclease (ENase; bsp6IR) and DNA methyltransferase (MTase; bsp6IM) has been determined. The genes are separated by 99 bp and are arranged tandemly with bsp6IR preceding bsp6IM. The DNA sequence predicts an ENase of 174 amino acids (aa) (19.9 kDa) and a MTase of 315 aa (36.3 kDa). M.Bsp6I contains all the conserved aa sequence motifs characteristic for m5C-MTases. In addition, its variable region exhibits a slight similarity to the 5'-GCNGC-3'-specific target-recognition domain (TRD) from M.phi 3T. No aa sequence similarity was found between R.Bsp6I and M.Bsp6I, nor among R.Bsp6I and other known ENases. We have tested recombinant plasmids carrying the complete R-M system for their ability to transform native and pre-methylated Escherichia coli hosts. The results indicate that pre-methylation increases the efficiency of establishment of the complete R-M system. In addition, we have obtained orientation-dependent differences in transformation efficiency.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of beta-mannanase gene from Bacillus subtilis NM-39.
AB  - A gene encoding beta-mannanase from Bacillus subtilis NM-39 was cloned into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha by using pUC 18 and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The beta-mannanase gene was 1080 base pairs long and encoded a mature protein of 336 amino acids and a signal peptide of 24 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned mannanase showed sequence homology with mannanase from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain AM-001 (about 50%).
TI  - The structure of subtilisin ALP I from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. NKS-21.
AB  - The gene for an alkaline serine protease from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. NKS-21 (subtilisin ALP I) was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The gene (aprQ) contained an open reading frame of 1125 bp, encoding a primary product of 374 amino acids. The mature protease, composed of 272 amino acids, was preceded by a putative signal sequence of 37 amino acids and a pro-sequence of 65 amino acids. The mature protease conserved the catalytic triad, Asp, His, and Ser, as subtilisin BPN' or other subtilisins, and the subtilisin ALP I might belong to the subtilisin super family. The primary structure of subtilisin ALP I was compared and discussed with those of 13 subtilisins, 5 subtilisins from alkalophilic Bacillus, and 8 from neutrophiles. Low homology was shown between subtilisin ALP I and subtilisins from alkalophiles or subtilisins from neutrophiles. Forty-five amino acid residues of the mature protein of subtilisin ALP I were entirely independent of other subtilisins. According to the homology of ALP I with other subtilisins, subtilisin ALP I might be in the middle point between alkaline subtilisins and neutral ones.
TI  - Prevalence of bacterial otitis media in primary school children in Enugu Surburb, Enugu state, Nigeria.
AB  - Out of a total school population of 3,070 pupils examined for discharging ear due to bacterial etiology, 44 (1.4%) had discharging ear. Forty eight species of bacteria belonging to 5 genera were isolated. These included, Staphylococcus aureus, 16 isolates; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10; escherichia coli, 11; Proteus species, 7; Bacillus sp. 4. The highest prevalence of infection (3.0%) was recorded in central school Akwuke, Awkunanaw. Analysis of the data showed that infection rate was highest among the 6-9 year old age group (61%) and lowest among the 15 years and above age group (5%). Boys recorded a higher prevalence of infection (55%) than girls (45%). However the difference was not statistically significant (x = 2.08, p > 0.01). All the organisms isolated were sensitive to genticin but resistant to other commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?
AB  - Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (S. Chatterjee, D. K. Chatterjee, R. H. Jani, J. Blumbach, B. N. Ganguli, N. Klesel, M. Limbert, and G. Seibert, J. Antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). Incubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. Biosyntheses of DNA, RNA, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and D-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. Thus, unlike type A lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. Mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. The formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. In contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. These data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Terminal oxidases of the bb- and caa3-types in Bacillus sp. FTU.
AB  - We previously identified two oxidases in the membranes of bacterium Bacillus sp.  FTU. One of them slowly (caa3) and the other rapidly (bo) recombines with carbon monoxide (CO) after laser flash photolysis, in this respect resembling the Escherichia coli bo- and bd-type oxidases, respectively. In the present study we found three copper atoms in the slowly CO-recombining oxidase from Bacillus sp. FTU. In the other oxidase, the copper content is very low and clearly substoichiometric. Reversed-phase chromatography revealed the presence of haems A and C in the Bacillus sp. FTU copper-containing oxidase and haems B and C in the non-copper-containing one. We thus suggest that the Bacillus sp. FTU oxidase rapidly reacting with CO previously attributed to bo-type by analogy in redox spectrum with the E. coli enzyme be redefined as bb-type oxidase.
TI  - A non-modular endo-beta-1,4-mannanase from Pseudomonas fluorescens subspecies cellulosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa when cultured in the presence of carob galactomannan degraded the polysaccharide. To isolate gene(s) from P. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa encoding endo-beta-1,4-mannanase (mannanase) activity, a genomic library of Pseudomonas DNA, constructed in lambda ZAPII, was screened for mannanase-expressing clones using the dye-labelled substrate, azo-carob galactomannan. The nucleotide sequence of the pseudomonad insert from a mannanase-positive clone revealed a single open reading frame of 1257 bp encoding a protein of M(r) 46,938. The deduced N-terminal sequence of the putative polypeptide conformed to a typical prokaryotic signal peptide. Truncated derivatives of the mannanase, lacking 54 and 16 residues from the N- and C-terminus respectively of the mature form of the enzyme, did not exhibit catalytic activity. Inspection of the primary structure of the mannanase did not reveal any obvious linker sequences or protein motifs characteristic of the non-catalytic domains located in other Pseudomonas plant cell wall hydrolases. These data indicate that the mannanase is non-modulator, comprising a single catalytic domain. Comparison of the mannanase sequence with those in the SWISSPROT database revealed greatest sequence homology with the mannanase from Bacillus sp. Thus the Pseudomonas enzyme belongs to glycosyl hydrolase Family 26, a family containing mannanases and endoglucanases. Analysis of the substrate specificity of the mannanase showed that the enzyme hydrolysed mannan and galactomannan, but displayed little activity towards other polysaccharides located in the plant cell wall. The enzyme had a pH optimum of approx. 7.0, was resistant to proteolysis and had an M(r) of 46,000 when expressed by Escherichia coli.
TI  - Structure-function relationship of the xylanase from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain 41M-1.
AB  - Xylanase J from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain 41M-1 contains a family G catalytic domain at the N-terminus, followed by a linker sequence and a functionally-unknown C-terminal domain. The mutational analysis of xylanase J indicated that Glu-93, Glu-183, Trp-18, Trp-86, Tyr-84 and Tyr-95 play an important role in the catalytic activity. A deletion derivative of xylanase J lacking the C-terminal domain retained its activity, suggesting that the C-terminal domain does not directly involved in catalysis.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the hom-thrC-thrB cluster from Bacillus sp. ULM1: expression of the thrC gene in Escherichia coli and corynebacteria, and evolutionary relationships of the threonine genes.
AB  - A 6.5 kb DNA fragment containing the gene (thrC) encoding threonine synthase, the last enzyme of the threonine biosynthetic pathway, has been cloned from the DNA of Bacillus sp. ULM1 by complementation of Escherichia coli and Brevibacterium lactofermentum thrC auxotrophs. Complementation studies showed that the thrB gene (encoding homoserine kinase) is found downstream from the thrC gene, and analysis of nucleotide sequences indicated that the hom gene (encoding homoserine dehydrogenase) is located upstream of the thrC gene. The organization of this cluster of genes is similar to the Bacillus subtilis threonine operon (hom-thrC-thrB). An 1.9 kb BclI fragment from the Bacillus sp. ULM1 DNA insert 351 amino acids was found corresponding to a protein of 37462 Da. The thrC gene showed a low G + C content (39.4%) and the encoded threonine synthase is very similar to the B. subtilis enzyme. Expression of the 1.9 kb BcI DNA fragment in E. coli minicells resulted in the formation of a 37 kDa protein. The upstream region of this gene shows promoter activity in E. coli but not in corynebacteria. A peptide sequence, including a lysine that is known to bind the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor, is conserved in all threonine synthase sequences and also in the threonine and serine dehydratase genes. Amino acid comparison of nine threonine synthases revealed evolutionary relationships between different groups of bacteria.
TI  - Two o-type oxidases in Methylobacillus flagellatum KT.
AB  - Two oxidases of the o-type in membranes of the methanol-grown obligate methylotroph Methylobacillus flagellatum KT were distinguished. For this purpose the kinetic analysis of the laser flash-induced optical absorbance changes of CO-oxidase complexes under reducing conditions was used. The ratio of these oxidases in membranes greatly depended on the phases of bacterial growth. One of the oxidases appeared to belong to the Escherichia coli o-type oxidase family being more sensitive to KCN (Ki = 1 microM). It showed monophasic CO recombination kinetics with tau 25-30 ms and was expressed in the early exponential phase of growth. The other oxidase seemed to be similar to the Bacillus sp. FTU o-type oxidase being less sensitive to KCN (Ki = 6 microM), having three-phasic CO reassociation kinetics with tau 35-70 microseconds, 0.25-0.5 ms and 2-4 ms and dominating in the stationary growth phase. Pyridine haemochrome spectra showed haems A and D to be absent from the bacterial membranes.
TI  - Cloning of the aapT gene and characterization of its product, alpha-amylase-pullulanase (AapT), from thermophilic and alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain XAL601.
AB  - A thermophilic and alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain, XAL601, was isolated from soil. It produces a thermostable and alkaline-stable enzyme with both alpha-amylase and pullulanase activities. The alpha-amylase-pullulanase gene (aapT) from this Bacillus strain was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined (GenBank accession number D28467). A very large open reading frame composed of 6,096 bases, which encodes 2,032 amino acid residues with an M(r) of 224,992, was found. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the four highly conserved regions that are common among amylolytic enzymes were well conserved. These include an active center and common substrate-binding sites of various amylases. In the C-terminal region, a six-amino-acid sequence (Gly-Ser-Gly-Thr-Thr-Pro) is repeated 12 times. The aapT gene was then subcloned in Escherichia coli and overexpressed under the control of the lac promoter. Purification of AapT from this recombinant E. coli was performed, and it was shown that the aapT gene product exhibits both alpha-amylase and pullulanase activities with one active site. The optimum temperature and pH for enzyme activity were found to be 70 degrees C and pH 9, respectively. Furthermore, AapT was found to strongly adsorb to crystalline cellulose (Avicel) and raw corn starch. Final hydrolyzed products from soluble starch range from maltose (G2) to maltotetraose (G4). Only maltotriose (G3) was produced from pullulan. The enzyme also hydrolyzes raw starch under a broad range of conditions (60 to 70 degrees C and pH 8 to 9).
TI  - Analysis of expression of the argC and argD genes in the cyanobacterium Anabaena  sp. strain PCC 7120.
AB  - A cloned DNA fragment from Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 that complements an arginine auxotrophic mutant from the same organism was found to include an open reading frame encoding a 427-residue polypeptide that is homologous to N-acetylornithine aminotransferase from Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene encoding N-acetylornithine aminotransferase in bacteria has been named argD. The expression of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 argD, as well as of argC, was analyzed at the mRNA level. Both genes were transcribed as monocistronic mRNAs, and their expression was not affected by exogenously added arginine. Primer extension analysis identified transcription start points for both genes which were preceded by sequences similar to that of the E. coli RNA polymerase sigma 70 consensus promoter. A second transcription start point for the argD gene that is not preceded by a sigma 70 consensus promoter was detected in dinitrogen-grown cultures.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative active site of endoglucanase K from Bacillus sp. KSM-330.
AB  - The roles of one Glu and four Asp residues of endoglucanase K from Bacillus sp. KSM-330, which are conserved in all the endo-beta-glucanases in the family D, were analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis. The gene for endoglucanase K was mutated to replace Asp-154, Asp-191, Asp-193 or Asp-300 by Asn, or to replace Glu-130 by Gln in the encoded enzyme. Mutant and wild-type genes were separately expressed in Bacillus subtilis and the resultant enzymes were purified from the culture broth. All mutant enzymes exhibited the same mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as the wild-type enzyme and gave similar circular dichroism spectra to that of the wild-type enzyme. Substitution of Glu-130, Asp-191, Asp-193 or Asp-300 significantly decreased the specific activity of the enzyme toward CM-cellulose. Kinetic analysis of the abilities of these mutant enzymes to liberate p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenylcellotrioside revealed that all the mutant enzymes had very much lower kcat values than that of the wild-type enzyme, while the Km values of these mutant enzymes were almost the same as that of the wild-type enzyme. Of these Glu and Asp residues, Glu-130 and Asp-191 seem to be most likely to be catalytic residues because substitutions of these residues resulted in the lowest kcat values of the mutant enzymes.
TI  - A simple method for determination of stereospecificity of aminotransferases for C-4' hydrogen transfer of the coenzyme.
AB  - A simple method was established for determination of the stereospecificity of C-4' hydrogen transfer of the coenzymes (pyridoxal and pyridoxamine). The method is based on the findings that aspartate aminotransferase of pig heart and D-amino acid aminotransferase of Bacillus sp. YM-1 catalyze the abstraction of the pro-S and pro-R proton at C-4' of pyridoxamine, respectively. Pyridoxal is a poor coenzyme, but readily released from the enzyme. It reacts in 3H2O with a substrate amino acid and an apo-aminotransferase whose stereospecificity for C-4' hydrogen transfer is to be determined. The resultant pyridoxamine which is tritiated at C-4' is incubated with an apo form of aspartate aminotransferase or D-amino acid aminotransferase and a substrate, alpha-keto acid. The stereospecificity for the C-4' hydrogen transfer examined is determined by measurement of radioactivity retained in the pyridoxal formed. We showed by means of this method that C-4' hydrogen transfer of coenzyme occurs on the si face of the external Schiff base in the transamination reactions of two aspartate aminotransferases of Bacillus sp. YM-2 and Escherichia coli, and aromatic amino acid aminotransferase of E. coli.
TI  - Responses of diverse heterotrophic bacteria to elevated copper concentrations.
AB  - The influence of copper on the growth of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus (three strains), and an unidentified Vibrio sp. was examined in batch cultures. The effects of copper at micromolar concentrations varied from undetectable to complete growth inhibition. Each strain was able to recover from a growth lag observed after copper addition at a characteristic concentration. Copper concentrations that allowed recovery ranged from 25 to 150 microM. Extracellular proteins in the medium of cultures that had recovered from copper stress were compared with those from control cultures. Protein profiles were analyzed for the presence of proteins similar to extracellular copper-binding proteins (CuBP) previously reported in V. alginolyticus. CuBP-like proteins were found in each Vibrio sp. examined. A protein of similar molecular mass was also detected in copper-stressed cultures of P. aeruginosa and not in control cultures. Escherichia coli and Bacillus spp. did not produce CuBP-like proteins. The data show that CuBP-like proteins are not produced by all bacteria in response to copper stress and indicate that such proteins are common in marine Vibrio spp.
TI  - Cloning of a new cryIA(a) gene from Bacillus thuringiensis strain FU-2-7 and analysis of chimaeric CryIA(a) proteins for toxicity.
AB  - We cloned the cryIA(a) gene from Bacillus thuringiensis strain FU-2-7, one of the toxin genes encoding lepidopteran-specific protoxins. Sequence analysis of the gene showed two amino acid differences (Pro77 to Leu and Phe965 to Ser) from the CryIA(a) of B. thuringiensis strain HD-1. We constructed chimaeric cryIA(a) genes using FU-2-7 and HD-1 cryIA(a) genes and isolated the chimaeric protoxins, as well as the parental ones, from Escherichia coli cells harboring the recombinant plasmids to examine the effects of the two amino acid variations on the toxicity. FU-2-7 CryIA(a) protein was about half as toxic against the smaller tea tortrix, Adoxophyes sp., and one-third as toxic against the silkworm, Bombyx mori, as that of HD-1. On the other hand, a chimaeric CryIA(a) protein with a single replacement of Phe965 to Ser had nearly the same toxicity as the HD-1 CryIA(a) against the smaller tea tortrix and one-third the toxicity against silkworm as that of HD-1. This improved property of the chimaeric CryIA(a) protoxin may be useful for widening its application to crop protection in sericultural countries.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a Bacillus sp. SAM1606 thermostable alpha-glucosidase with transglucosylation activity.
AB  - We purified a novel alpha-glucosidase to homogeneity from an Escherichia coli recombinant transformed with the alpha-glucosidase gene from thermophilic Bacillus sp. SAM1606. The enzyme existed as mono- and multimeric forms of a promoter protein with a relative molecular weight of 64,000 and isoelectric point of 4.6. We isolated a monomeric form of the enzyme and characterized it. The enzyme was unique among the known alpha-glucosidases in both broad substrate specificity and high thermostability. The enzyme hydrolysed a variety of O-alpha-D-glucopyranosides such as nigerose, maltose, isomaltose, sucrose, and trehalose efficiently. The molecular activity (k0) and the Michaelis constant (Km) values at 55 degrees C and pH 6.0 for sucrose were 54.6 s-1 and 5.3 mM, respectively. The optimum pH and temperature for hydrolysis were pH 5.5 and 75 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme exhibited a high transglucosylation activity: it reacted with 1.8 M sucrose at 60 degrees C for 70 h to yield oligosaccharides containing theanderose in a maximum yield of 35% (w/w). High thermostability of the enzyme (stable up to 65 degrees C at pH 7.2 for 10 min) permits the transglucosylation reaction at high temperatures, which would be beneficial for continuous production of oligosaccharides from sucrose.
TI  - Analysis of a Het- mutation in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 implicates a secondary metabolite in the regulation of heterocyst spacing.
AB  - Transposon-generated mutant N10 of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 has a Het- phenotype (A. Ernst, T. Black, Y. Cai, J.-M. Panoff, D. N. Tiwari, and C. P. Wolk, J. Bacteriol. 174:6025-6032, 1992). Reconstruction of the transposon mutation reproduced a Het- phenotype, but reconstructions with other insertions at the position of the transposon produced strains that form multiple contiguous heterocysts. Sequence analysis around the site of insertion of the transposon showed that the insertion lies within the 5' end of an 861-bp open reading frame (ORF) (hetN). The product of translation of hetN (HetN) shows extensive similarity to NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases that are involved in biosyntheses of fatty acids, poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate, nod factor, and polyketides. A second, 1,518-bp ORF (hetM) that ends 556 bp 5' from the start of hetN appears to encode a protein that has at least two functional domains: its amino terminus is similar to an acyl carrier protein, while its central portion is similar to domains of proteins that perform reductive reactions. A third, 711-bp ORF (hetI) encoded on the opposite strand ends 42 bp away from the 3' end of hetN. The protein encoded by hetI, HetI, is similar to Sfp from Bacillus subtilis and EntD from Escherichia coli, proteins that are required for the biosynthesis or export of cyclic peptides. Clones from a lambda-EMBL3 library that contain the wild-type DNA for hetN do not complement the hetN::Tn5-1063 mutation in N10. The presence of hetN, as the only ORF, on a replicating plasmid suppresses heterocyst formation in wild-type cells, whereas the additional presence of hetI alleviates this effect.
TI  - Cloning and DNA sequencing of bgaA, a gene encoding an endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase, from an alkalophilic Bacillus strain (N137).
AB  - The gene bgaA encoding an alkaline endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase (lichenase) from an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain N137, isolated in our laboratory, was cloned and expressed from its own promoter in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a 1,416-bp DNA fragment containing bgaA was determined and revealed an open reading frame of 828 nucleotides. The deduced protein sequence consists of 276 amino acids and has a 31-amino-acid putative signal peptide which is functional in E. coli, in which the BgaA protein is located mainly in the periplasmic space. The lichenase activity of BgaA is stable between pH 6 and 12, it shows optimal activity at a temperature between 60 and 70 degrees C, and it retains 65% of its activity after incubation at 70 degrees C for 1 h. This protein is similar to some other lichenases from Bacillus species such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. licheniformis, B. macerans, B. polymyxa, and B. subtilis. However, it has a lysine-rich region at the carboxy terminus which is not found in any other published lichenase sequence and might be implicated in the unusual biochemical properties of this enzyme. The location of the mRNA 5' end was determined by primer extension and corresponds to nucleotide 235. A typical Bacillus sigma A promoter precedes the transcription start site.
TI  - Primary sequence of the chitosanase from Streptomyces sp. strain N174 and comparison with other endoglycosidases.
AB  - A 1.6-kb DNA fragment from the soil actinomycete, Streptomyces sp. strain N174, containing the gene (csn) encoding an extracellular chitosanase (CSN), has been isolated and its complete nucleotide sequence determined. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and Streptomyces lividans using appropriate vectors. The sequence was found to contain one large ORF which encodes a protein of 238 amino acids (aa). The deduced aa sequence begins with a signal peptide which has an unusual C-terminal segment, well recognized by the Streptomyces secretion system, but poorly in Escherichia coli. The strain N174 CSN aa sequence was compared with those of other proteins and significant homology was found only with the Bacillus circulans MH-K1 CSN but not with known chitinases or lysozymes. This suggests that CSN form a new enzyme family distinct from other endoglycosidases.
TI  - Clustering and co-transcription of the Bacillus subtilis genes encoding the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases specific for glutamate and for cysteine and the first enzyme for cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  - The Bacillus subtilis cysE and cysS genes encoding, respectively, the serine acetyltransferase and the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase were found downstream from the gltX gene encoding the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. This gene organization is also conserved in Bacillus stearothermophilus where the cysE and cysS genes show high amino acid identity with those of B. subtilis. In both organisms the coding sequences of cysE and cysS overlap, suggesting a translational coupling. B. subtilis cysE and cysS were expressed in Escherichia coli using the inducible trc promoter; they functionally complement mutants of E. coli affected in those genes. Overproduction of B. subtilis CysRS in E. coli has a toxic effect on cell growth. Disruption of gltX and cysS by Campbell-type insertion is lethal for the cell, indicating that these genes code for an essential and unique function in B. subtilis. S1 mapping analysis shows that the transcription of gltX is under the control of a sigma A promoter located 43 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon. A T-box sequence and a rho-independent terminator known to regulate expression of other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes and of some amino acid biosynthetic operons in Bacillus sp., were found between gltX and cysE. No sigma A promoter was detected upstream of cysE, which is consistent with the lethality of a Campbell-type insertion using a plasmid that interrupts transcription coming from the gltX promoter, and suggests that gltX, cysE, and cysS constitute an operon. This is the first case where genes implicated in the biosynthesis of an amino acid and its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase are shown to be co-transcribed.
TI  - Structure and expression of a gene coding for thermostable alpha-glucosidase with a broad substrate specificity from Bacillus sp. SAM1606.
AB  - We cloned an alpha-glucosidase gene from thermophilic Bacillus sp. SAM1606 to overexpress it in Escherichia coli transformants. Deletion of the 5'-noncoding region as well as expression of the alpha-glucosidase gene under the control of the icp promotor of the insecticidal crystal protein gene from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. sotto enhanced the enzyme productivity to 23.5 U/ml, which was 12,000-fold higher than that obtained by the strain SAM1606. The open reading frame corresponding to the alpha-glucosidase encoded 587 amino acid residues including a residue coded by the initiation codon TTG, and the molecular mass of the alpha-glucosidase from N-terminal serine was calculated to be 68,886 Da. Sequence analysis revealed that the SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase belonged to the alpha-amylase family. The SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase showed extremely high sequence identity (62-65%) to the Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thermoglucosidasius oligo-1,6-glucosidases, which were 72% identical to each other. Sequence identity in the suggested active site regions were essentially the same (80-82%) among these three enzymes. However, the substrate specificity of the SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase was significantly different from those of the oligo-1,6-glucosidases. The thermostability of these three alpha-glucosidases could be correlated with the increase in the number of proline residues, whose occurrence was predicted at beta turns and coils in the enzymes.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain TB-90 urease gene complex in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The urease of thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain TB-90 is composed of three subunits with molecular masses of 61, 12, and 11 kDa. By using synthetic oligonucleotide probes based on N-terminal amino acid sequences of each subunit, we cloned a 3.2-kb EcoRI fragment of TB-90 genomic DNA. Moreover, we cloned two other DNA fragments by gene walking starting from this fragment. Finally, we reconstructed in vitro a 6.2-kb DNA fragment which expressed catalytically active urease in Escherichia coli by combining these three DNA fragments. Nucleotide sequencing analysis revealed that the urease gene complex consists of nine genes, which were designed ureA, ureB, ureC, ureE, ureF, ureG, ureD, ureH, and ureI in order of arrangement. The structural genes ureA, ureB, and ureC encode the 11-, 12-, and 61-kDa subunits, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of UreD, UreE, UreF, and UreG, the gene products of four accessory genes, are homologous to those of the corresponding Ure proteins of Klebsiella aerogenes. UreD, UreF, and UreG were essential for expression of urease activity in E. coli and are suggested to play important roles in the maturation step of the urease in a co- and/or posttranslational manner. On the other hand, UreH and UreI exhibited no significant similarity to the known accessory proteins of other bacteria. However, UreH showed 23% amino acid identity to the Alcaligenes eutrophus HoxN protein, a high-affinity nickel transporter.
TI  - Anabaena xisF gene encodes a developmentally regulated site-specific recombinase.
AB  - Two DNA elements are excised from the chromosome during Anabaena heterocyst differentiation. We have identified the gene xisF which encodes the site-specific recombinase responsible for the excision of a 55-kb element from within the fdxN gene. The cloned xisF gene is sufficient to cause site-specific rearrangement of an artificial substrate in Escherichia coli. Inactivation of xisF in the Anabaena chromosome prevents excision of the fdxN element and growth in nitrogen-deficient medium but does not alter the development of heterocysts. Forced transcription of xisF in vegetative cells did not result in excision of the fdxN element, suggesting that other factors may be involved in cell-type specificity. The predicted XisF protein shows significant similarity to the Bacillus subtilis SpoIVCA recombinase.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of putative active-site amino acid residues of 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase, conserved within the low-homology isomerase/hydratase enzyme family.
AB  - During beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, mitochondrial 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase (mECI) converts 3-cis- or 3-trans-enoyl-CoA intermediates into their 2-trans isomers. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of mECI shows weak but significant homologies to the peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme (pTFE), the alpha-subunit of the fatty acid degradation complex from Escherichia coli (FadB), the mitochondrial 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase (mECH), the naphthoate synthase encoded by the menB gene from Bacillus subtilis (MenB), and the 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. (CBDH). These proteins from the isomerase/hydratase enzyme family. Tyr-150, Arg-151, and Asp-211 of the mECI are the only amino acids with protic side chains conserved within the enzymes with isomerase activity (pTFE and FadB). These amino acids are exchanged in the remaining enzymes of the isomerase/hydratase family. Glu-165 is conserved in all enzymes with isomerase and/or hydratase activity (pTFE, FadB, and mECH). We argue that these amino acids are possibly involved in the proton transfer at the active site of mECI. To test this hypothesis, mECI was functionally expressed in E. coli. The recombinant enzyme (rmECI) exhibits the same specific activity as the enzyme from rat liver. Exchange of the candidate active-site amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Tyr-150 is not involved in isomerase catalysis. The exchange of Arg-151 and Asp-211 leads to a reduced expression of the recombinant enzyme accompanied by a reduced specific activity. The replacement of Glu-165 by Gln leads to a strongly reduced enzymatic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Construction of a model secretion system for oral streptococci.
AB  - A DNA fragment corresponding to the secretory domain from the Streptococcus mutans GS-5 gtfB gene, which encodes the putative 38-amino-acid signal peptide of the glucosyltransferase I (GTF-I) enzyme product, has been constructed. This fragment was fused with the alpha-amylase structural gene from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 707. This hybrid gene as well as the intact amylase gene were introduced into an Escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector consisting of three components: the E. coli replicon p15Aori from pACYC177, an erythromycin resistance gene from pAM beta-1, and the streptococcal replicon from pVA838. Transformation of the oral noncariogenic bacterium Streptococcus gordonii with the chimeric plasmid harboring the hybrid amylase gene resulted in strong extracellular amylase production. By contrast, transformants containing the intact amylase gene exhibited only trace amounts of amylase activity in culture fluids. Since the two signal peptide structures of the GTF-I enzyme and the Bacillus amylase are distinct from each other, these differences might result from the inability of S. gordonii to correctly process the Bacillus signal peptide. Furthermore, culture fluids from transformants of S. mutans as well as Streptococcus milleri harboring the hybrid amylase gene showed only weak amylase activity. Deletion of the gtfB, gtfC, or ftf gene from S. mutans GS-5 did not increase amylase secretion following transformation with the hybrid amylase gene. These results suggest that in contrast to S. gordonii, the inability of S. mutans and S. milleri to secrete hybrid amylase molecules could result from incorrect interaction of the secretory components of these organisms with amylase precursor molecules.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies that react with live Listeria spp.
AB  - Seven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Listeria spp. that were reactive with  live Listeria spp. were developed. Two of these MAbs (55-8 and 55-37) were members of the immunoglobulin M class, and all other MAbs were members of the immunoglobulin G class. MAb 55-23 reacted with 148 of 157 strains tested. MAb 34-51 reacted with serotype 1/2a, 1/2b, and 1/2c strains and exhibited a scattered reaction pattern with strains belonging to other serotypes. MAb 55-44 reacted with all of the strains belonging to serotype 4b tested. MAb 55-4 reacted with all of the serotype 1/2a isolates tested, although reactivity with other isolates also was observed. The other MAbs exhibited scattered reaction patterns. No correlation of reactivity pattern with serotype was found. Marked differences were observed between the reactivities of MAbs as determined by a magnetic immunoluminescence assay and a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Only MAb 55-23 exhibited minor reactivity with three Streptococcus spp. isolates, while no reactivity was observed with six Bacillus spp. strains, one Escherichia coli strain, and one Citrobacter sp. strain. In Western blots (immunoblots) MAbs 55-23, 55-44, and 34-9 exhibited reactivity; all other MAbs were negative in this assay.
TI  - Effect of promoter modification on mosquitocidal cryIVB gene expression in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942.
AB  - The impact of promoter modification on the expression of the mosquitocidal Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis cryIVB gene when used to transform the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 has been examined. Maximal transcript and protein abundances were achieved by the addition of the lacZ promoter upstream of the cryIVB sequence. Replacement of the endogenous corresponding Bacillus sequences with the Synechococcus petF1 promoter, ribosome binding site, and initiation codon also resulted in increased expression of the cryIVB gene relative to the expression obtained with the Bacillus promoter alone but decreased expression relative to the expression achieved with the tandem array of the Bacillus and lacZ promoters. Synechococcus cells carrying plasmids in which the expression of the cryIVB gene was regulated by either the lacZ or the petF1 promoter were readily consumed by first-instar Culex restuans larvae and proved to be toxic for these organisms.
TI  - Three histidine residues in the active center of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase  from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. 1011: effects of the replacement on pH dependence and transition-state stabilization.
AB  - Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) catalyzes the formation of cyclodextrins from amylose through an intramolecular transglycosylation reaction. On the basis of the three-dimensional structures of CGTases three histidine residues, which are conserved between CGTases and alpha-amylases, are located at the active center and are proposed to constitute the substrate binding sites. The three histidine residues (His-140, His-233, and His-327) of CGTase from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. 1011 were individually replaced by site-directed mutagenesis to probe their roles in catalysis. Asparagine-replaced CGTases (H140N-, H233N-, and H327N-CGTase) retained cyclization activity but had altered production ratios of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrin. Replacement of histidine by asparagine residues strongly affected the kcat for beta-cyclodextrin-forming, coupling, and hydrolyzing activities, whereas it barely affected the Km values. The activation energies for alpha-cyclodextrin hydrolysis were increased more than 12 kJ/mol by the replacement. Furthermore, the Ki values of acarbose, which is thought to be a transition-state analog of glycosidase catalysis, were 2-3 orders of magnitude larger in asparagine-replaced CGTases than that in wild-type CGTase. Therefore, the three histidine residues participate in the stabilization of the transition state, whereas they participate little in ground-state substrate binding. H327N-CGTase had decreased activity over an alkaline pH range, indicating that His-327 is important for catalysis over an alkaline pH range.
TI  - Cloning and extracellular expression in Escherichia coli of xylanases from an alkaliphilic thermophilic Bacillus sp. NCIM 59.
AB  - A genomic DNA library of an alkaliphilic thermophilic Bacillus was constructed in Escherichia coli with pUC 8 vector and was screened using a Congo red xylan plate clearance assay. Six xylanase positive transformants having identical inserts showed immunological reactivity towards polyclonal antibodies raised against purified xylanase (M(r) 15,800) from the Bacillus. A 4.5-kb HindIII-EcoRI subfragment was found to code for two xylanases of M(r) 14,500 and 35,000. Equivalent amounts of xylanase activity were detected from IPTG induced and noninduced recombinants irrespective of the orientation of the 4.5-kb insert with respect to the lac promoter, indicating that xylanase gene expression was under the control of its own promoter. 95% of the xylanase activity (2 U/ml) was found in the extracellular culture filtrate. The hydrolysis of xylan by the recombinant xylanases yielded mainly xylobiose.
TI  - Multisensory activation of the phosphorelay initiating sporulation in Bacillus subtilis: identification and sequence of the protein kinase of the alternate pathway.
AB  - The phosphorelay is the signal-transduction system recognizing and integrating environmental signals to initiate sporulation. The major signal input to the phosphorelay is an ATP-dependent kinase, KinA, responsible for phosphorylating the SpoOF protein. Mutants lacking KinA, however, still sporulate, suggesting that other kinases can fulfil its role. In order to identify these kinases, genes for kinases were isolated by hybridization using a degenerate oligonucleotide probe designed for common regions of this class of kinases. A gene for a second kinase, KinB, was isolated which gave a sporulation negative phenotype when inactivated in a kinA background. The kinB locus was sequenced and found to be a small operon consisting of the kinB gene and another gene, kapB, transcribed from a single.sigma A.-dependent promoter. Inactivation of either kinB or kapB in a kinA strain led to severe sporulation deficiency. The kinB gene coded for a 47774 M(r) protein with the carboxyl half of this protein highly homologous to the same domain of KinA. The amino-terminal domain of KinB was hydrophobic with six recognizable membrane-spanning regions. The kapB gene coded for a moderately charged, probably soluble, protein of 14,668 M(r) with no homology to any known protein. Genetic evidence suggests that KapB is required either for the function of KinB or for its expression. Although double mutants kinA kinB cannot sporulate and assume a stage 0 phenotype, the SpoA approximately P-dependent regulation of the abrB gene is normal in these strains, suggesting that low levels of SpoA approximately P accumulate even in the absence of both kinases. This accumulation is dependent on functional spo0F and spo0B genes and its source is unknown. The KinA and KinB pathways are the only pathways capable of producing sufficient Spo0A approximately P to allow initiation and completion of sporulation under laboratory conditions.
TI  - Some characteristics of a proteinase from a thermophilic Bacillus sp. expressed in Escherichia coli: comparison with the native enzyme and its processing in E. coli and in vitro.
AB  - Proteinase Ak.1 was produced during the stationary phase of Bacillus sp. Ak.1 cultures. It is a serine proteinase with a pI of 4.0, and the molecular mass was estimated to be 36.9 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The enzyme was stable at 60 and 70 degrees C, with half-lives of 13 h and 19 min at 80 and 90 degrees C, respectively. Maximum proteolytic activity was observed at pH 7.5 with azocasein as a substrate, and the enzyme also cleaved the endoproteinase substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-NH-Np (succinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-phenylalanine p-nitroanalide). Major cleavage sites of the insulin B chain were identified as Leu-15-Tyr-16, Gln-4-His-5, and Glu-13-Ala-14. The proteinase gene was cloned in Escherichia coli, and expression of the active enzyme was detected in the extracellular medium at 75 degrees C. The enzyme is expressed in E. coli as an inactive proproteinase at 37 degrees C and is converted to the mature enzyme by heating the cell-free media to 60 degrees C or above. The proproteinase was purified to homogeneity and had a pI of 4.3 and a molecular mass of 45 kDa. The NH2-terminal sequence was Ala-Ser-Asn-Asp-Gly-Val-Glu-, showing the exact signal peptide cleavage point. Heating the proenzyme resulted in the production of active proteinase with an NH2-terminal sequence identical to that of the native enzyme. The characteristics of the cloned proteinase were identical to those of the native enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the Bacillus subtilis spore photoproduct lyase (spl) gene, which is involved in repair of UV radiation-induced DNA damage during spore germination.
AB  - Upon UV irradiation, Bacillus subtilis spore DNA accumulates the novel thymine dimer 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine. Spores can repair this "spore photoproduct" (SP) upon germination either by the uvr-mediated general excision repair pathway or by the SP-specific spl pathway, which involves in situ monomerization of SP to two thymines by an enzyme named SP lyase. Mutants lacking both repair pathways produce spores that are extremely sensitive to UV. For cloning DNA that can repair a mutation in the spl pathway called spl-1, a library of EcoRI fragments of chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis 168 was constructed in integrative plasmid pJH101 and introduced by transformation into a mutant B. subtilis strain that carries both the uvrA42 and spl-1 mutations, and transformants whose spores exhibited UV resistance were selected by UV irradiation. With a combination of genetic and physical mapping techniques, the DNA responsible for the restoration of UV resistance was shown to be present on a 2.3-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment that was mapped to a new locus in the metC-pyrD region of the B. subtilis chromosome immediately downstream from the pstI gene. The spl coding sequence was localized on the cloned fragment by analysis of in vitro-generated deletions and by nucleotide sequencing. The spl nucleotide sequence contains an open reading frame capable of encoding a 40-kDa polypeptide that shows regional amino acid sequence homology to DNA photolyases from a number of bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Cloning and overexpression of the triosephosphate isomerase genes from psychrophilic and thermophilic bacteria. Structural comparison of the predicted protein sequences.
AB  - We focused on the temperature adaptation of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM; E.C.  5.3.1.1.) by comparing the structure of TIMs isolated from bacterial organisms living in either cold or hot environments. The TIM gene from psychrophilic bacteria Moraxella sp. TA137 was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. Its deduced amino acid sequence revealed 34% identity with the thermophilic bacteria Bacillus stearothermophilus TIM. Expression vectors were constructed and recombinant Moraxella TA137 and Bacillus stearothermophilus TIMs were overproduced and purified to homogeneity. Recombinant TIM inactivation constants (Ki), measured at various temperatures, compared to those of the mesophilic Escherichia coli recombinant TIM clearly show that Moraxella TA137 and B. stearothermophilus TIMs have respectively psychrophilic and thermophilic characteristics. To try to elucidate the structure-thermolability and structure-thermostability relationship, factors affecting the overall stability of these two TIMs were examined, based on the alignment with the mesophilic chicken TIM, the three-dimensional structure of which is already known. From this comparison, it appears that the adaptability of TIM to high temperature is favored by better stabilizing residues for the helix dipole as well as better helix-forming residues whereas the adaptability of TIM to low temperature seems to reside in the nature of helix-capping residues.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of new heterocyclic structures: [1,3]thiazino[2,3-i]purine, thiazolo[3,2-c] [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo [4', 5': 4,5] pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine.
AB  - Some derivatives of thiazolo[3,2-c]pyrimidine, pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine, thiazolo[2,3-i]purine, [1,3]thiazino[2,3-i]purine, thiazolo[3,2-c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo[4',5':4,5]pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine were prepared. The compounds were tested for antimicrobial and antimycotic activity on a number of strains, namely, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Candida albicans, Aspergillus sp., and for antiviral activity on Herpes simplex virus, Type 1 (HSV-1), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Coxsackievirus B5 (CoxB5). The compounds proved to be devoid of activity against viruses, mycetes and gram-negative bacteria, while some of them exhibited a modest activity against gram-positive bacterial strains.
TI  - Analysis of the flagellin (hag) gene of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. C-125.
AB  - Motility of the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. C-125, a flagellate bacterium, was demonstrated to be Na(+)- and pH-dependent. Flagellin protein from this strain was purified to homogeneity and the N-terminal sequence determined. Using the hag gene of Bacillus subtilis as a probe, the hag gene of Bacillus sp. C-125 was identified and cloned into Escherichia coli. Sequencing of this hag gene revealed that it encodes a protein of 272 amino acids (M(r) 29,995). The predicted N terminal sequence of this protein was identical to that determined by N-terminal sequencing of the flagellin protein from strain C-125. The alkalophilic Bacillus sp. C-125 flagellin shares homology with other known flagellins in both the N- and C-terminal regions. The middle portion, however, shows considerable differences, even from that of flagellin from the related species, B. subtilis.
TI  - Molecular cloning, nucleotide sequence and expression of the structural gene for  a thermostable alkaline protease from Bacillus sp. no. AH-101.
AB  - Alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. no. AH-101 produces an extremely thermostable alkaline  serine protease that has a high optimum pH (pH 12-13) and shows keratinolytic activity. The gene encoding this protease was cloned in Escherichia coli and expressed in B. subtilis. The cloned protease was identical to the AH-101 protease in its optimum pH and thermostability at high alkaline pH. An open reading frame of 1083 bases, identified as the protease gene, was preceded by a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AAAGGAGG) with a spacing of 11 bases. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a pre-pro-peptide of 93 residues followed by the mature protease comprising 268 residues. AH-101 protease showed slightly higher homology to alkaline proteases from alkaliphilic bacilli (61.2% and 65.3%) than to those from neutrophilic bacilli (54.9-56.7%). Also AH-101 protease and other proteases from alkaliphilic bacilli shared common amino acid changes and a four amino acid deletion when compared to the proteases from neutrophilic bacilli. AH-101 protease, however, was distinct among the proteases from alkaliphilic bacilli in showing the lowest homology to the others.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for aspartokinase II from a thermophilic methylotrophic Bacillus sp.
AB  - The structural gene coding for the lysine-sensitive aspartokinase II of the methylotrophic thermotolerant Bacillus sp. strain MGA3 was cloned from a genomic library by complementation of an Escherichia coli auxotrophic mutant lacking all three aspartokinase isozymes. The nucleotide sequence of the entire 2.2-kb PstI fragment was determined, and a single open reading frame coding for the aspartokinase II enzyme was found. Aspartokinase II was shown to be an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer (M(r) 122,000) with the beta subunit (M(r) 18,000) encoded within the alpha subunit (M(r) 45,000) in the samea reading frame. The enzyme was purified, and the N-terminal sequences of the alpha and beta subunits were identical with those predicted from the gene sequences. The predicted amino acid sequence was 76% identical with the sequence of the Bacillus subtilis aspartokinase II. The transcription initiation site was located approximately 350 bp upstream of the translation start site, and putative promoter regions at -10 (TATGCT) and -35 (ATGACA) were identified. A 300-nucleotide intervening sequence between the transcription initiation and translational start sites suggests a possible attenuation mechanism for the regulation of transcription of this enzyme in the presence of lysine.
TI  - Molecular cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression of the structural gene for alkaline serine protease from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. 221.
AB  - The gene encoding an alkaline serine protease from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. 221  was cloned in Escherichia coli and expressed in Bacillus subtilis. An open reading frame of 1,140 bases, identified as the protease gene was preceded by a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG) with a spacing of 7 bases. The deduced amino acid sequence had a pre-pro-peptide of 111 residues followed by the mature protease comprising 269 residues. The alkaline protease from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. 221 had higher homology to the protease from alkaliphilic bacilli (82.1% and 99.6%) than to those from neutrophilic bacilli (60.6-61.7%). Also Bacillus sp. 221 protease and other protease from alkaliphilic bacilli shared common amino acid changes and 4 amino acid deletions that seemed to be related to characteristics of the enzyme of alkaliphilic bacilli when compared to the proteases from neutrophilic bacilli.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. C125 gene  homologous to Bacillus subtilis sec Y.
AB  - A 1.8 kb HindIII DNA fragment containing the secY gene of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. C125 has been cloned into plasmid pUC119 using the B. subtilis secY gene as a probe. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA indicated that it contained one complete ORF and parts of two other ORFs. The similarity of these ORFs to the sequences of the B. subtilis proteins indicated that they were the genes for ribosomal protein L15-SecY-adenylate kinase, in that order. The gene product of the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. C125 secY homologue was composed of 431 amino acids and its M(r) value has been calculated to be 47,100. The distribution of hydrophobic amino acids in the gene product suggested that the protein was a membrane integrated protein with ten transmembrane segments. The total amino acid sequence of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. C125 secY homologue showed 69.7% homology with that of B. subtilis secY. Regions of remarkably high homology (78% identity) were present in transmembrane regions, and cytoplasmic domains (73% identity) with less homologous regions present in extracellular domains (43% identity).
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the gene for an alkaline endoglucanase from an alkalophilic Bacillus and its expression in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The gene for an alkaline endoglucanase from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. KSM-64  was cloned into the HindIII site of pBR322 and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. The nucleotide sequence of a 4.1-kb region of the HindIII insert had two open reading frames, ORF-1 and ORF-2. The protein deduced from ORF-1 was composed of 244 amino acids with an M(r) of 27,865. Subcloning analysis proved that the alkaline endoglucanase was encoded by ORF-2 (822 amino acids with an M(r) of 91,040). Upstream from ORF-2, there were three consensus like sequences of the sigma A-type promoter of Bacillus subtilis, a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGGT), and a catabolite repression operator-like sequence (TGTAAGCGGTTAACC). The HindIII insert was subcloned into a shuttle vector, pHY300PLK, and the encoded alkaline endoglucanase gene was highly expressed both in E. coli and B. subtilis. One of the three promoter-like sequences in ORF-2 could be suitable for high levels of enzyme expression in both host organisms.
TI  - Glutamyl-tRNA reductase from Escherichia coli and Synechocystis 6803. Gene structure and expression.
AB  - In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and in the enterobacterium Escherichia coli delta-amino-levulinic acid (ALA) is formed from glutamyl-tRNA by the sequential action of two enzymes, glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase. E. coli has two GluTR proteins with sizes of 45 kDa (GluTR45) and 85 kDa (GluTR85) (Jahn, D., Michelsen, U., and Soll, D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2542-2548). The hemA gene, isolated from E. coli and several other eubacteria, has been proposed to encode a structural component of GluTR. Because of the inability to overexpress this gene in E. coli, we demonstrate directly GluTR function for the E. coli hemA gene product by its expression and functional analysis in yeast, which does not form ALA from Glu-tRNA. Gel filtration experiments demonstrated definitively that the yeast-expressed HemA protein corresponded to GluTR45. Furthermore, analysis of GluTR activity in an E. coli strain with a disrupted hemA gene displayed GluTR85, but not GluTR45 activity. The hemA gene from Synechocystis 6803 was cloned by functional complementation in E. coli. DNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame capable of encoding a 427-amino acid polypeptide (molecular mass of 47,525 Da). The Synechocystis 6803 amino acid sequence shows significant similarity upon alignment with HemA sequences from E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Chlorobium vibrioforme but does not contain the amino acid sequence derived from the N terminus of the previously purified GluTR protein (Rieble, S., and Beale, S. I. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9740-9745). These experiments are the first direct demonstration of GluTR activity of the HemA protein and provide further evidence for two pathways of ALA formation in prokaryotes.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for citrate synthase from a thermotolerant Bacillus sp.
AB  - The structural gene coding for citrate synthase from the gram-positive soil isolate Bacillus sp. strain C4 (ATCC 55182) capable of secreting acetic acid at pH 5.0 to 7.0 in the presence of dolime has been cloned from a genomic library by complementation of an Escherichia coli auxotrophic mutant lacking citrate synthase. The nucleotide sequence of the entire 3.1-kb HindIII fragment has been determined, and one major open reading frame was found coding for citrate synthase (ctsA). Citrate synthase from Bacillus sp. strain C4 was found to be a dimer (Mr, 84,500) with a subunit with an Mr of 42,000. The N-terminal sequence was found to be identical with that predicted from the gene sequence. The kinetics were best fit to a bisubstrate enzyme with an ordered mechanism. Bacillus sp. strain C4 citrate synthase was not activated by potassium chloride and was not inhibited by NADH, ATP, ADP, or AMP at levels up to 1 mM. The predicted amino acid sequence was compared with that of the E. coli, Acinetobacter anitratum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rickettsia prowazekii, porcine heart, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes.
TI  - Organization and characterization of three genes involved in D-xylose catabolism  in Lactobacillus pentosus.
AB  - A cluster of three genes involved in D-xylose catabolism (viz. xylose genes) in Lactobacillus pentosus has been cloned in Escherichia coli and characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis. The deduced gene products show considerable sequence similarity to a repressor protein involved in the regulation of expression of xylose genes in Bacillus subtilis (58%), to E. coli and B. subtilis D-xylose isomerase (68% and 77%, respectively), and to E. coli D-xylulose kinase (58%). The cloned genes represent functional xylose genes since they are able to complement the inability of a L. casei strain to ferment D-xylose. NMR analysis confirmed that 13C-xylose was converted into 13C-acetate in L. casei cells transformed with L. pentosus xylose genes but not in untransformed L. casei cells. Comparison with the aligned amino acid sequences of D-xylose isomerases of different bacteria suggests that L. pentosus D-xylose isomerase belongs to the same similarity group as B. subtilis and E. coli D-xylose isomerase and not to a second similarity group comprising D-xylose isomerases of Streptomyces violaceoniger, Ampullariella sp. and Actinoplanes. The organization of the L. pentosus xylose genes, 5'-xylR (1167 bp, repressor) - xylA (1350 bp, D-xylose isomerase) - xylB (1506 bp, D-xylulose kinase) - 3' is similar to that in B. subtilis. In contrast to B. subtilis xylR, L. pentosus xylR is transcribed in the same direction as xylA and xylB.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from Bacillus sp. KSM-330.
AB  - The gene encoding an acid endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from Bacillus sp. KSM-330 was cloned into the HindIII site of pBR322 and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. The recombinant plasmid contained a 3.1 kb HindIII insert, 1.8 kb of which was sufficient for the expression of endoglucanase activity in E. coli HB101. Nucleotide sequencing of this region (1816 bp) revealed an open reading frame of 1389 bp. The protein deduced from this sequence was composed of 463 amino acids with an Mr of 51882. The deduced amino acid sequence from amino acids 56 through 75 coincided with the amino-terminal sequence of the endoglucanase, Endo-K, purified from culture of Bacillus sp. KSM-330. The deduced amino acid sequence of Endo-K had 30% homology with that of the celA enzyme from Clostridium thermocellum NCIB 10682 and 25% homology with that of the enzyme from Cellulomonas uda CB4. However, the Endo-K protein exhibited no homology with respect to either the nucleotide or the amino acid sequences of other endoglucanases from Bacillus that had been previously characterized. These results indicate that the gene for Endo-K in Bacillus sp. KSM-330 has evolved from an ancestral gene distinct from that of other Bacillus endoglucanases.
TI  - Utility of phenomenological models for describing temperature dependence of bacterial growth.
AB  - We compared three unstructured mathematical models, the master reaction, the square root, and the damage/repair models, for describing the relationship between temperature and the specific growth rates of bacteria. The models were evaluated on the basis of several criteria: applicability, ease of use, simple interpretation of model parameters, problem-free determination of model parameters, statistical evaluation of goodness of fit (chi 2 test), and biological relevance. Best-fit parameters for the master reaction model could be obtained by using two consecutive nonlinear least-square fits. The damage/repair model proved to be unsuited for the data sets considered and was judged markedly overparameterized. The square root model allowed nonproblematical parameter estimation by a nonlinear least-square procedure and, together with the master reaction model, was able to describe the temperature dependence of the specific growth rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae NCIB 418, Escherichia coli NC3, Bacillus sp. strain NCIB 12522, and the thermotolerant coccobacillus strain NA17. The square root and master reaction models were judged to be equally valid and superior to the damage/repair model, even though the square root model is devoid of a conceptual basis.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of a gene encoding a 73 kDa xylanase enzyme from the rumen anaerobe Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c.
AB  - The cloning, expression and nucleotide sequence of a 3 kb DNA segment on pLS206 containing a xylanase gene (xynB) from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c was investigated. The open reading frame (ORF) of 1905 bp encoded a xylanase of 635 amino acid residues (Mr 73156). At least 850 bp at the 3' end of the gene could be deleted without loss of xylanase activity. The deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed by purifying the enzyme and subjecting it to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. In Escherichia coli C600 (pLS206) cells the xylanase was localized in the cytoplasm. Its optimum pH for activity was between pH 5.4 and 6, and optimum temperature 55 degrees C. The primary structure of the xylanase showed a significant level of identity with a cellobiohydrolase/endoglucanase of Caldocellum saccharolyticum, as well as with the xylanases of the alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125, B. fibrisolvens strain 49, and Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa.
TI  - Secondary metabolites by chemical screening, 15. Structure and absolute configuration of naphthomevalin, a new dihydro-naphthoquinone antibiotic from Streptomyces sp.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding NADH dehydrogenase from an alkalophile,  Bacillus sp. strain YN-1.
AB  - The gene encoding NADH dehydrogenase from an alkalophile, Bacillus sp., was cloned and sequenced. The cloned DNA fragment contained an open reading frame of 1,557 nucleotides which encodes a polypeptide composed of 519 amino acid residues (Mr 55,830). The predicted amino acid sequence was consistent with the partial amino acid sequences including the N-terminal and C-terminal sequences determined in a previous study. Sequence comparison with other flavoenzymes revealed high homology between the present dehydrogenase and Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase.
TI  - [Plasmid pBS195 with a wide range of hosts, isolated from lactobacilli].
AB  - The nonconjugative 4.4 kb plasmid pBS195 has been found in Lactobacillus sp. 195  strain resistant to kanamycin and streptomycin. The plasmid pBS195 determining the resistance to kanamycin has a broad host range. It is inherited by the Gram-positive microorganisms (Bacillus subtilis) as well as by Escherichia coli cells, has the cleavage sites for the restriction endonucleases BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, KpnI. The restriction map of the plasmid for these enzymes is constructed. The broad host range, efficiently expressed marker, the presence of the unique restriction sites, small size make the plasmid pBS195 promising for the genetic engineering research.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the sarcosine oxidase gene from Bacillus sp. NS-129 in  Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene coding for a thermostable sarcosine oxidase (EC 1.5.3.1) was isolated from Bacillus sp. NS-129. The primary structure of sarcosine oxidase deduced from the nucleotide sequence was a protein composed of 387 amino acids with molecular weight 42,955. When the sarcosine oxidase was overproduced to about 35% of soluble protein in E. coli under the control of a lac promoter, the sarcosine oxidase activity of the crude extract was increased 3-fold by the addition of FAD. This indicates that most of the enzyme is accumulated in an active form, a flavinless aporotein, in the cell.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the gene encoding the principal sigma factor of the vegetative cell RNA polymerase from the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120.
AB  - The filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 responds to combined  nitrogen deprivation by forming specialized nitrogen-fixing cells at regular intervals along the filament. Genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that regulation of gene expression during differentiation occurs at the transcriptional level. As part of a characterization of RNA polymerase during differentiation, the gene encoding the 52-kDa principal sigma factor of the Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 vegetative-cell RNA polymerase was isolated by using an oligonucleotide probe based on the sequence of the N-terminal seven amino acids of the purified protein. sigA codes for a 390-amino-acid polypeptide that has a predicted molecular weight of 45,641. The amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded by sigA contains four regions corresponding to conserved domains of the principal RNA polymerase sigma factors of Escherichia coli (sigma 70) and Bacillus subtilis (sigma 43). Thus, although the subunit composition of cyanobacterial RNA polymerase core differs from that of other eubacteria (G. J. Schneider and R. Haselkorn, J. Bacteriol. 170:4136-4140, 1988), the principal sigma factor of at least one cyanobacterium is typically eubacterial. In contrast to sigma 70 and sigma 43 operon organization, sigA is monocistronic and encodes two transcripts of 1.7 and 2.2 kb. The abundance of the 1.7-kb transcript remains constant under both nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-limiting conditions, whereas the 2.2-kb transcript is induced following the removal of combined nitrogen. Continued or enhanced transcription of sigA under nitrogen starvation conditions is consistent with the observation that the principal RNA polymerase in differentiating cells contains SigA.
TI  - Electron microscopic analysis and biochemical characterization of a novel methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. C1.
AB  - Methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. C1 was studied by electron microscopy and image processing. Two main projections can be distinguished: one exhibits 5-fold symmetry and has a diameter of 15 nm, the other is rectangular with sides of 15 and 9 nm. Subsequent image processing showed that the 5-fold view possesses mirror symmetry. The rectangular views can be divided into two separate classes, one of which has 2-fold rotational symmetry. It is concluded that methanol dehydrogenase is a decameric molecule, and a tentative model is presented. The estimated molecular weight is 430,000, based on a subunit molecular weight of 43,000. The enzyme contains one zinc and one to two magnesium ions per subunit. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed substantial similarity with alcohol dehydrogenases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zymomonas mobilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Escherichia coli, which contain iron or zinc but no magnesium. In view of the aberrant structural and kinetic properties, it is proposed to distinguish the enzyme from common alcohol dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.1) by using the name NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase.
TI  - Construction and characterization of the chimeric enzymes between the Bacillus subtilis cellulase and an alkalophilic Bacillus cellulase.
AB  - The amino acid sequences of cellulase from Bacillus subtilis (BSC) and that from  an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. N-4 (NK1) show significant homology in most parts except for the C-terminal portions. Despite the high homology, the pH activity profiles of the two enzymes are quite different; BSC has its optimum pH at 6-6.5, whereas NK1 is active over a broad pH range from 6 to 10.5. In order to identify the structural features which determine such pH activity profiles, chimeric cellulases between BSC and NK1 were constructed using four restriction sites commonly present within the homologous coding sequences, and were produced in Escherichia coli. The chimeric cellulases showed various chromatographic behaviors, reflecting the origins of their C-terminal regions. The pH activity profiles of the chimeric enzymes in the alkaline range could be classified into either the BSC or NK1 type mainly depending on the origins of the fifth C-terminal regions. In the acidic range, the profile was determined only by the origin of the fourth enzyme region from the N terminus. Comparison of the kinetic parameters between pH 5 and 6 using p-nitrophenyl cellobioside as a substrate indicated that the fourth region is responsible for the pH-dependent change of the kcat value. Only a limited number of amino acids in the fourth region may affect on deprotonation of catalytic residues of the cellulases and modulate the catalytic activity in the acidic pH values.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and genetic mapping of a Bacillus subtilis cell wall hydrolase gene.
AB  - We have cloned DNA fragments from Bacillus subtilis 168S into Escherichia coli, which produced a lytic zone on an agar medium containing B. subtilis cell wall. Sequencing of the fragments showed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) which encodes a polypeptide of 272 amino acids with a molecular mass of 29919 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence showed considerable homology with that of the cell wall hydrolase gene of Bacillus sp. (Potvin, C., Leclerc, D., Tremblay, G., Asselin, A. & Bellemare, G. (1988). Molecular and General Genetics 214, 241-248). Accordingly, the gene was designated cwlA, for cell wall lysis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of cwlA gene product prepared from a E. coli clone was AIKVVKNLVSKSKYGLKCPN, which is consistent with that of the deduced sequence starting from Ala at second position from the initiation codon of the cwlA gene. A presumed sigma A promoter and a rho-independent terminator were found upstream and downstream of the ORF, respectively. A chloramphenicol-resistance determinant integrated into the ORF was mapped by PBS1 transduction, which indicated the gene sequence dnaE-aroD-cwlA.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of a xylanase gene from the anaerobic ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.
AB  - A gene coding for xylanase activity, xynA, from the anaerobic ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 was cloned into Escherichia coli JM83 by using plasmid pUC19. The gene was located on a 2.3-kilobase (kb) DNA insert composed of two adjacent EcoRI fragments of 1.65 and 0.65 kb. Expression of xylanase activity required parts of both EcoRI segments. In E. coli, the cloned xylanase enzyme was not secreted and remained cell associated. The enzyme exhibited no arabinosidase, cellulase, alpha-glucosidase, or xylosidase activity. The isoelectric point of the cloned protein was approximately 9.8, and optimal xylanase activity was obtained at pH 5.4. The nucleotide sequence of the 1,535-base-pair EcoRV-EcoRI segment from the B. fibrisolvens chromosome that included the xynA gene was determined. An open reading frame was found that encoded a 411-amino-acid-residue polypeptide of 46,664 daltons. A putative ribosome-binding site, promoter, and leader sequence were identified. Comparison of the XynA protein sequence with that of the XynA protein from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125 revealed considerable homology, with 37% identical residues or conservative changes. The presence of the cloned xylanase gene in other strains of Butyrivibrio was examined by Southern hybridization. The cloned xylanase gene hybridized strongly to chromosomal sequences in only two of five closely related strains.
TI  - Molecular cloning, nucleotide sequence and expression in Escherichia coli of the  beta-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase gene from Bacillus circulans strain no. 8.
AB  - The beta-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (beta-CGTase) gene was isolated from a  lambda-library prepared from Bacillus circulans strain no. 8. It was subcloned into plasmid pTZ and expressed by its endogenous regulatory sequences in Escherichia coli JM 103. The structural gene was sequenced and showed an open reading frame for a polypeptide of 718 amino acid residues. The recombinant beta-CGTase had the same enzymatic properties as the extracellular CGTase (684 amino acid residues, corresponding to a mol. wt. of 74416) produced by B. circulans strain no. 8. The amino acid sequence showed the highest homology (74.6% identical amino acids) with the CGTase of B. circulans strain F-2, which had been erroneously described as an amylase. The homology with the enzyme from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain no. 1011 was 71.4%. The amino acid sequence derived will be used for elucidating the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of a gene for alkaline cellulase from Bacillus sp. KSM-635.
AB  - A gene for alkaline cellulase from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. KSM-635 was cloned into the HindIII site of pBR322 and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. Although the recombinant plasmid contained two HindIII inserts of 2.6 kb and 4.0 kb, the inserts were found to be contiguous in the Bacillus genome by hybridization analysis. Nucleotide sequences of a 2.4 kb region which was indispensable for the production of cellulase, and the flanking, 1.1 kb region, were determined. There was an open reading frame (ORF) of 2823 bp in the 3498 bp sequence determined, which encoded 941 amino acid residues. Two putative ribosome-binding sites and a sigma 43-type, promoter-like sequence were found upstream from an initiation codon in the ORF. The deduced amino-terminal sequence resembles the signal peptide of extracellular proteins. A region of amino acids, 249 to 568, of the deduced amino acid sequence of the cellulase from this organism is homologous with those of alkaline and neutral enzymes of other micro-organisms, but nine amino acid residues were found to be conserved only in the alkaline enzymes.
TI  - Lactobacillus hilgardii plasmid pLAB1000 consists of two functional cassettes commonly found in other gram-positive organisms.
AB  - A Lactobacillus hilgardii plasmid, pLAB1000, was studied to understand the organization of autonomous replicons from lactobacilli. Two cassettes could be identified. First, the replication region consisted of a sequence coding for a replication protein (Rep) and its corresponding target site, similar to those from plasmids pUB110, pC194 (Staphylococcus aureus), pFTB14, pBAA1 (Bacillus sp.), and pLP1 (Lactobacillus sp.). Sequence analysis indicated the possible synthesis of an antisense RNA that might regulate Rep production. The results also suggested that pLAB1000 replicates via a single-stranded DNA intermediate, and a putative lagging-strand initiation site was found that had similarities to those of alpha 3, St-1, and G4 isometric bacteriophages. The second cassette of pLAB1000 consisted of a sequence coding for a putative mobilization protein (Mob) and its corresponding RSA site. This cassette was similar to those found in pT181, pUB110, pE194 (S. aureus), and pG12 (Bacillus sp.), and it was found to be conserved among different Lactobacillus plasmid replicons. The origin and evolution of these functional cassettes are also discussed.
TI  - Highly repetitive DNA sequences in cyanobacterial genomes.
AB  - We characterized three distinct families of repeated sequences in the genome of the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. strain PCC 7601. These repeated sequences were present at a level of about 100 copies per Calothrix genome and consisted of tandemly amplified heptanucleotides. These elements were named short tandemly repeated repetitive (STRR) sequences. We used the three different Calothrix STRR sequences as probes to perform Southern hybridization experiments with DNAs extracted from various cyanobacterial strains, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. The three different STRR sequences were found as repetitive genomic DNA components specific to the heterocystous strains tested. The role of the STRR sequences, as well as their possible use in taxonomic studies, is discussed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 branching enzyme gene (glgB): expression in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 glgB gene has been determined. The gene contains a single open reading frame (ORF) of 2322 bp encoding a polypeptide of 774 amino acids (aa) with an Mr of 89,206. Extensive sequence similarity exists between the deduced aa sequence of the Synechococcus sp. glgB gene product and that of the Escherichia coli branching enzyme in the middle portions of the proteins (62% identical aa). In contrast, the N-terminal portions shared little homology. The sequenced region which follows glgB contains an ORF encoding 79 aa of the N terminus of a polypeptide that shares extensive sequence similarity (41% identical aa) with human and rat uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. This suggests that the region downstream from glgB contains the hemE gene and, therefore, that the organization of genes involved in glycogen biosynthesis in Synechococcus sp. is different from that described for E. coli. A fusion gene was constructed between the 5' end of the Bacillus licheniformis penP gene and the Synechococcus sp. glgB gene. The fusion gene was efficiently expressed in the Gram+ micro-organism Bacillus subtilis and specified a branching enzyme with an optimal temperature for activity similar to the wild-type enzyme.
TI  - Purification and characterization of thermostable aspartate aminotransferase from a thermophilic Bacillus species.
AB  - Aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1) was purified to homogeneity from cell extracts of a newly isolated thermophilic bacterium, Bacillus sp. strain YM-2. The enzyme consisted of two subunits identical in molecular weight (Mr, 42,000) and showed microheterogeneity, giving two bands with pIs of 4.1 and 4.5 upon isoelectric focusing. The enzyme contained 1 mol of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate per mol of subunit and exhibited maxima at about 360 and 415 nm in absorption and circular dichroism spectra. The intensities of the two bands were dependent on the buffer pH; at neutral or slightly alkaline pH, where the enzyme showed its maximum activity, the absorption peak at 360 nm was prominent. The enzyme was specific for L-aspartate and L-cysteine sulfinate as amino donors and alpha-ketoglutarate as an amino acceptor; the KmS were determined to be 3.0 mM for L-aspartate and 2.6 mM for alpha-ketoglutarate. The enzyme was most active at 70 degrees C and had a higher thermostability than the enzyme from Escherichia coli. The N-terminal amino acid sequence (24 residues) did not show any similarity with the sequences of mammalian and E. coli enzymes, but several residues were identical with those of the thermoacidophilic archaebacterial enzyme recently reported.
TI  - Expression of the beta-cyclodextrin glucanotransferase gene of an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. #1011 in Escherichia coli cells and characterization of the synthesized enzyme.
AB  - To express efficiently the gene for extracellular beta-cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (beta-CGTase) of an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. #1011 using the E. coli promoters (tac, trp and PL promoters), three DNA fragments starting from the nucleotide positions +1, -18, and -48 of the translation initiation site of the gene were prepared and they were fused with the promoters. The maximum production of the enzyme, which was located mainly (90%) in the periplasm of the E. coli strain, was observed in the combination of the trp promoter and the beta-CGTase gene starting from the -48 nucleotide position in the presence of the inducer, IAA. The production of the enzyme was increased to 5.5 times that by the E. coli harboring the original plasmid and to approximately 3 times higher than the extracellular production of the enzyme by the parental Bacillus sp. #1011. The properties including the stability and optimum in the high pH range (pH 9) of the extracellular beta-CGTase from the alkalophilic Bacillus was conserved in the periplasmic enzymes of the E. coli cells.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the raw-starch-digesting amylase gene from Bacillus sp. B1018 and its strong homology to the cyclodextrin glucanotransferase genes.
AB  - The gene coding for the raw-starch-digesting amylase from Bacillus sp. B1018 was  cloned into Escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Starting at an ATG codon, there was an open reading frame composed of 2139 bp (713 amino acids). The NH2-terminal portion encoded a 27 amino acid-long signal peptide. S1 mapping revealed the presence of a typical promoter region upstream from the transcription initiation site. The deduced amino acid sequence of the extracellular mature enzyme was very similar to those of cyclodextrin glucanotransferases (CGTases), especially that of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. 1011 (87% homology). In fact, the B1018 amylase showed CGTase activity. The COOH-terminal portion of the B1018 amylase shows significant homology with other raw-starch-digesting enzymes.
TI  - Identification of essential histidine residues in the active site of Escherichia  coli xylose (glucose) isomerase.
AB  - Two conserved histidine residues (His-101 and His-271) appear to be essential components in the active site of the enzyme xylose (glucose) isomerase (EC 5.3.1.5). These amino acid residues were targeted for mutagenesis on the basis of sequence homology among xylose isomerases isolated from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Ampullariella sp. strain 3876, and Streptomyces violaceus-niger. Each residue was selectively replaced by site-directed mutagenesis and shown to be essential for activity. No measurable activity was observed for any mutations replacing either His-101 or His-271. Circular dichroism measurements revealed no significant change in the overall conformation of the mutant enzymes, and all formed dimers similar to the wild-type enzyme. Mutations at His-271 could be distinguished from those at His-101, since the former resulted in a thermolabile protein whereas no significant change in heat stability was observed for the latter. Based upon these results and structural data recently reported, we speculate that His-101 is the catalytic base mediating the reaction. Replacement of His-271 may render the enzyme thermolabile, since this residue appears to be a ligand for one of the metal ions in the active site of the enzyme.
TI  - Effect of organic amendments on bacterial multiplication in lake water.
AB  - In Cayuga Lake water amended with 30 micrograms of glucose or amino acids per ml, an added strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens and indigenous bacteria grew extensively, Pseudomonas sp. B4 and two rhizobia multiplied at a moderate extent, and introduced Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae multiplied but to only a slight degree. The amendments did not enhance growth of Micrococcus flavus and Arthrobacter citreus, and an asporogenous strain of Bacillus subtilis decreased in numbers. The pseudomonads, rhizobia, E. coli and K. pneumoniae multiplied extensively when inoculated into sterile lake water amended with amino acids, A. citreus grew to a slight extent, but the numbers of M. flavus and B. subtilis did not change appreciably. In nonsterile lake water amended with 30 micrograms of Trypticase soy broth per ml, the indigenous bacteria greatly increased in abundance, the pseudomonads, rhizobia, and E. coli developed to a lesser extent, the numbers of K. pneumoniae, A. citreus and M. flavus showed little increase, and B. subtilis decreased in numbers. Tests in pure culture containing 2 to 64 micrograms of Trypticase soy broth per ml demonstrated good growth of P. fluorescens, Pseudomonas sp. B4, and the rhizobia at all concentrations; an initial decline followed by growth of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and R. leguminosarum biovar phaseoli at low concentrations; little or no growth or decline at the low levels but multiplication at the high levels by A. citreus and B. subtilis; and decline of M. flavus. It is proposed that the apparent Ks value, mumax value, length of lag phase and resistance to stress can be used to predict behavior of bacteria in lake water receiving low levels of organic nutrients.
TI  - Comparison of CD composition produced by chimeric CGTases.
AB  - Using 12 chimeric cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferases (CGTases) constructed from two genes, the CGTase gene from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain No. 38-2 (CGTase 38-2 gene) and the CGTase gene from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain No. 17-1 (CGTase 17-1 gene), we compared the effect of those chimeric enzymes on cyclodextrin (CD) production, especially on the composition of the CDs produced. It was found that the N-terminal and the C-terminal segments were important for CD production. Chimeric enzymes that contained the N-terminal and the C-terminal segments derived from CGTase 38-2 produced large amounts of CD, and especially a higher proportion of alpha-CD than those of other chimeric enzymes.
TI  - Two Bacillus beta-mannanases having different COOH termini are produced in Escherichia coli carrying pMAH5.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence was determined for the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain AM-001 beta-mannanase gene which produced two beta-mannanases (A and B) in Escherichia coli transformants. The putative beta-mannanase gene was 1,539 base pairs long and encoded a mature beta-mannanase protein of 487 amino acids and a signal peptide of 26 amino acids. The COOH-terminal amino acid of beta-mannanase A is an arginine residue located at amino acid 513 of the deduced amino acid sequence, and that of beta-mannanase B is a valine residue located at amino acid 365. Deletion derivatives having 1,098 base pairs from the ATG start codon maintained the beta-mannanase activity of the encoded polypeptide. However, clones harboring DNA fragments (1,051 base pairs) shorter than the gene which encoded beta-mannanase B (1,095 base pairs) did not exhibit the beta-mannanase activity. The simultaneous production of both beta-mannanases A and B in an E. coli transformant was demonstrated by the maxicell procedure.
TI  - Construction of a chimeric series of Bacillus cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferases and analysis of the thermal stabilities and pH optima of the enzymes.
AB  - The cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) gene from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain no. 17-1 was cloned in Escherichia coli. The cloned CGTase gene consisted of a single open reading frame which would encode a polypeptide of 713 amino acids, and the first 27 amino acid residues comprised a signal peptide. The nucleotide sequence and the amino acid sequence of this CGTase (CGTase 17-1) gene had strong homology with those of the CGTase (CGTase 38-2) gene previously cloned in our laboratory from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain no. 38-2, although the enzymic properties of the CGTase 17-1 were distinct from those of the CGTase 38-2. To analyse those enzymic properties further, we constructed 12 chimeric CGTases using three restriction nuclease sites and compared the enzymic properties of the chimeric CGTases. The N-terminal part of the enzyme was important for heat stability, and the pH-activity profile was influenced by both the N- and the C-terminal parts. A third segment was less important for enzymic properties.
TI  - Purification, crystallization, and preliminary x-ray diffraction studies of the flavoenzyme mercuric ion reductase from Bacillus sp. strain RC607.
AB  - The flavoenzyme mercuric ion reductase from Bacillus sp. strain RC607 was purified by dye-ligand affinity chromatography. The protein was crystallized from solutions of high ionic strength, and one of the two crystal forms obtained has proven suitable for x-ray diffraction studies. Preliminary analysis showed that these crystals belong to the tetragonal space group 1422. The unit cell dimensions are a = b = 180.7 A; c = 127.9 A. The diffraction pattern extends to better than 3 A resolution. Crystal density measurements are consistent with one enzyme dimer of 2 x 69,000 Da comprising the asymmetric unit. Trypsin treatment of the native enzyme resulted in the removal of 157 amino acids at the N terminus. After purification, the remaining fragment (amino acids 158-631), which is still fully active in vitro, could be crystallized under the same conditions as native enzyme. Twinning problems, however, did not allow complete analysis of these crystals.
TI  - Functions of the COOH-terminal region of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. #1011: relation to catalyzing activity and pH stability.
AB  - Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (beta-CGTase) of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. #1011  degrades starch to mainly beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD). This enzyme is considered to contain an extra-polypeptide in its COOH-terminal region in addition to its NH2-terminal domain which exhibits the starch-degrading activity. To analyze the functions of this extra-polypeptide in the beta-CGTase, two mutated enzymes, in which DNA regions encoding 10 or 13 amino acids from the COOH-terminus were deleted, were obtained. The mutated enzymes degraded starch to glucose, maltooligosaccharides and alpha-CD, in addition to beta-CD. Furthermore, the pH stability of the mutated enzymes in the alkaline pH range (pH 9-11) was reduced.
TI  - Thermostable alanine dehydrogenase of Bacillus sp. DSM730: gene cloning, purification, and characterization.
AB  - We have cloned the thermostable alanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.1) gene from a thermophile, Bacillus sp. DSM730, into Escherichia coli C600 with a vector plasmid, pBR322. The enzyme was overproduced by the transformed cells, and purified to homogeneity with a yield of 69% by heat treatment and another step. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 250,000 and consists of 6 subunits identical in molecular weight (43,000). It is not inactivated by heat treatment at 75 degrees C for 60 min, or incubation in the pH range of 5.5-10.5 at 55 degrees C for 10 min. The enzyme ctalyzes the oxidative deamination of L-serine in addition to L-alanine. The oxo analogue of serine is as reactive as pyruvate. Thus, the enzyme differs markedly from alanine dehydrogenases so far studied.
TI  - Screening of isoquinoline alkaloids and their derivatives for antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - A screening test of antimicrobial activities for some of the isoquinoline alkaloids and their first and second Hofmann elimination products was conducted in this study. Results showed that (+)-actinodaphnine (1), (+)-N-Me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), (-)-xylopine (19) and (-)-N-Me-xylopine MeI (20), had the strongest inhibitory activities against three G(+) bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus) MIC greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml). Whereas anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine MeI (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), dicentrine methine (23), roemerine methine (26), dicentrine bismethine (29) and O-Me-armepavine methine (48) also had antibacterial effects against these same three G(+) bacteria (MIC = 50-300 micrograms/ml). However, only (+)-actinodaphnine (1) and roemerine methine (26) showed weak effects against two G(-) bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia) (MIC = 300 micrograms/ml). (+)-Actinodaphnine(1), (+)-N-Me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine MeI (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), O-Me-armepavine methine (48) and O,O-di-Et-N-Me-coclaurine methine (49) had potent antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and other Candida species (MIC = 62.5-1000 micrograms/ml).
TI  - The third cellulase of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain N-4: evolutionary relationships within the cel gene family.
AB  - The third cellulase gene (celC) of Bacillus sp. strain N-4 was cloned in plasmid  pBR322 and was located within a 5.5-kb HindIII fragment. The cellulase encoded by this fragment had an Mr of about 100,000 and showed optimum activity around pH 9. These properties were different from those of the enzymes encoded by the celA and celB genes of the same organism. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence was found to be highly homologous to the CEL-F enzyme from Bacillus sp. strain No. 1139 [Fukumori et al., J. Gen. Microbiol. 132 (1986) 2329-2335]. An evolutionary relationship observed among the four cellulases of alkalophilic Bacillus strains and that of Bacillus subtilis endoglucanase suggested that ancestral genes for alkaline and neutral cellulases diverged early in the evolution of these enzymes.
TI  - The nucleotide sequence of the lipo-penicillinase gene of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 170.
AB  - The lipo-penicillinase (LIPEN) gene from an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 170  was cloned in Escherichia coli using the vector pHSG399. A plasmid, pFAP121, was isolated from an ampicillin resistant transformant and the cloned LIPEN gene was found to be in a 2.2 kb DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence of a 1.9 kb segment encoding the LIPEN was determined. This segment showed an open reading frame which would encode a polypeptide of 310 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of this LIPEN gene product has strong homology with those of the Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase III and Bacillus licheniformis penicillinase.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of a chromosomal mercury resistance determinant from a Bacillus sp. with broad-spectrum mercury resistance.
AB  - A 13.5-kilobase HindIII fragment, bearing an intact mercury resistance (mer) operon, was isolated from chromosomal DNA of broad-spectrum mercury-resistant Bacillus sp. strain RC607 by using as a probe a clone containing the mercury reductase (merA) gene. The new clone, pYW33, expressed broad-spectrum mercury resistance both in Escherichia coli and in Bacillus subtilis, but only in B. subtilis was the mercuric reductase activity inducible. Sequencing of a 1.8-kilobase mercury hypersensitivity-producing fragment revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 may code for a regulatory protein (MerR). ORF2 and ORF4 were associated with cellular transport function and the hypersensitivity phenotype. DNA fragments encompassing the merA and the merB genes were sequenced. The predicted Bacillus sp. strain RC607 MerA (mercuric reductase) and MerB (organomercurial lyase) were similar to those predicted from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 (67 and 73% amino acid identities, respectively); however, only 40% of the amino acid residues of RC607 MerA were identical to those of the mercuric reductase from gram-negative bacteria. A 69-kilodalton polypeptide was isolated and identified as the merA gene product by examination of its amino-terminal sequence.
TI  - A new cloning system for Bacillus subtilis comprising elements of phage, plasmid  and transposon vectors.
AB  - A new cloning system for Bacillus subtilis was devised which makes use of a combination of Tn917-containing phage SP beta derivatives and Tn917-containing Escherichia coli-B. subtilis shuttle plasmids. This system allows the initial cloning of genes in single copy, via 'prophage transformation', with a selection for complementation of mutational defects in B. subtilis hosts and permits subsequent transfer of the cloned material by homologous recombination to low-copy and high-copy vectors that replicate in both B. subtilis and E. coli. Because cloned sequences are adjacent to pB322-derived DNA in the recombinant phages, inserts can also be 'rescued' directly from the phage DNA after digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes, circularization of the fragments by ligation and transformation of an E. coli recipient. Two genomic libraries of B. subtilis chromosomal Sau3A-generated partial-digest fragments in the size ranges of 5-8 kb and 8-10 kb were constructed and screened for the complementation of mutations aroI906, cysA14, dal-1, glyB133, metC3, purA16, purB33, thrA5, trpC2 and recE4. In all cases, specialized transducing phages carrying inserts that complemented the selected markers were recovered. Inserts complementing the dal-1 and trpC2 mutations could be transferred from recombinant phages to Tn917-containing plasmids by homologous recombination without in vitro subcloning. Another insert complementing the purB33 mutation was rescued directly into E. coli from a recombinant phage DNA.
TI  - Some factors affecting isolation of Clostridium tetani from human and animal stools.
AB  - Clostridium tetani was isolated from human and animal stools at the following rates [95% confidence interval (CI)]: Human, 0% (1.5-0); horse, 1% (5-0); cow in cowshed, 4% (10-1); cow in pasture, 8.3% (17-1), calf in pasture, 0% (7-0); dog, 2% (11-0) and sheep in pasture, 25% (44-14). Quantification of C. tetani in 16 animal stools positive for the bacillus was impossible in most cases, as the number of tetanus bacilli present was not large enough for this purpose. Contaminating anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria in human and animal stools, i.e., C. perfringens and Streptococcus sp., Group G, inhibited isolation of C. tetani from these materials, particularly at the step of isolation employing its swarming character.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of a Bacillus bacteriolytic enzyme in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Several hundred bacterial isolates were screened for bacteriolytic activity by growing them on agar medium containing autoclaved, lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells as the substrate. A Bacillus sp. producing the largest lytic zone was selected. A genomic bank of this selected bacterium was constructed in the multi-functional vector pTZ18R, with partial SauIIIA DNA fragments inserted at the SalI restriction site. Screening of 800 colonies of this bank for cell lysis gave 5 recombinants exhibiting lytic activity, as detected by analysis of extracts of sonicated Escherichia coli cells on denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing autoclaved, lyophilized M. lysodeikticus cells as the substrate. One clone (pBH2500), expressed in E. coli strain NM522, was found to code for a lytic enzyme corresponding, in molecular weight, to the 27 kDa Bacillus sp. hydrolase. This clone with an insertion of 2.5 kb was then subcloned as a 929 bp EcoRI-SauIIIA fragment in pTZ18R (pBH929) and showed higher cell lytic activity. A unique open reading frame for a protein of 251 amino acids, followed by a putative terminator sequence, was found after a consensus ribosome binding site. A putative leader sequence was identified in the first 37 amino acids. One truncated subclone (pBH703), corresponding to 196 out of 251 residues from the protein N-terminal end, still possessed lytic activity.
TI  - Sequence and analysis of the DNA encoding protective antigen of Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the protective antigen (PA) gene from Bacillus anthracis and the 5' and 3' flanking sequences were determined. PA is one of three proteins comprising anthrax toxin; and its nucleotide sequence is the first to be reported from B. anthracis. The open reading frame (ORF) is 2319 bp long, of which 2205 bp encode the 735 amino acids of the secreted protein. This region is preceded by 29 codons, which appear to encode a signal peptide having characteristics in common with those of other secreted proteins. A consensus TATAAT sequence was located at the putative -10 promoter site. A Shine-Dalgarno site similar to that found in genes of other Bacillus sp. was located 7 bp upstream from the ATG start codon. The codon usage for the PA gene reflected its high A + T (69%) base composition and differed from those of genes for bacterial proteins from most other sequences examined. The TAA translation stop codon was followed by an inverted repeat forming a potential termination signal. In addition, a 192-codon ORF of unknown significance, theoretically encoding a 21.6-kDa protein, preceded the 5' end of the PA gene.
TI  - A survey of aerobic bacteria and fungi in the feces of healthy psittacine birds.
AB  - Fecal samples from 61 clinically healthy psittacine birds of a wide variety of species were cultured for bacteria and fungi. The most common bacterial isolates were gram-positive bacilli, which were recovered from 60 of the 61 birds. These organisms included Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, and Streptomyces. Gram-positive cocci, cultured from the feces of 21 of the birds, included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus spp., Aerococcus spp., and Micrococcus spp. Only 6 of the 61 psittaciformes yielded gram-negative bacteria, with Escherichia coli being the most frequent isolate. Gram-negative bacilli were recovered from 4 of the 31 privately owned birds and 2 of the 30 petshop birds sampled. In addition to the bacteria, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus laurentii, and Aspergillus sp. were isolated from 13 fecal cultures. Candida albicans was isolated exclusively from 5 petshop birds. The number of birds yielding Corynebacterium and gram-negative bacteria increased with age, whereas the number of birds yielding lactobacilli and yeasts decreased with age. The organisms isolated and their significance as potential pathogens in psittacine birds are discussed.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase gene from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain no. 38-2.
AB  - The cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) gene from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain no. 38-2 was cloned in Escherichia coli using pBR322. A plasmid, pCS8, was isolated from a transformant producing CGTase and the cloned CGTase gene was found to be in a 5.3 kb DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.5 kb segment encoding the CGTase was determined. This segment showed an open reading frame which would encode a polypeptide of 712 amino acids. The pCS8 CGTase had the same enzymic properties as those of the extracellular CGTase produced by the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain no. 38-2. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of this CGTase gene and gene product, respectively, have strong homology with those of the Bacillus macerans CGTase.
TI  - Molecular cloning of an endoglucanase gene from an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. and  its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - One of the cellulase genes from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain N-4 was cloned in pBR322. A recombinant plasmid, pYBC107, expressing carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) was isolated, and the size of the cloned HindIII fragment was found to be 5.5 kilobases. The restriction map of pYBC107 showed a different pattern from those of pNKI and pNKII (N. Sashihara, T. Kudo, and K. Horikoshi, J. Bacteriol. 158:503-506, 1984). When the HindIII fragment from pYBC107 was subcloned into pYEJ001, there was a 3.8-fold increase in CMCase activity over that observed with pYBC107. Plasmid pYBC108 constructed by treatment of pYBC107 with HindIII and EcoRI expressed the CMCase activity, although to a limited extent. To verify the originality of cloned pYBC107 from Bacillus sp., we analyzed the restriction digest by Southern blotting.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of chromosomal mercury resistance genes from a Bacillus sp.
AB  - A 7.9-kilobase (kb) chromosomal fragment was cloned from a mercury-resistant Bacillus sp. In Escherichia coli, in the presence of a second plasmid carrying functional transport genes, resistance to HgCl2 and to phenylmercury acetate (PMA) was expressed. Shortening the cloned fragment to 3.8 kb abolished resistance to PMA but not to HgCl2. In Bacillus subtilis, the 3.8-kb fragment produced mercuric reductase constitutively but did not produce resistance to HgCl2 or to PMA.
TI  - A protoplast transformation system for Listeria sp.
AB  - We describe protoplast transformation of members of the genus Listeria with plasmid DNA. Shuttle vectors able to replicate in both Escherichia coli and Listeria have been constructed by fusing the E. coli plasmid pUC8 with the Bacillus subtilis plasmids pBD9 and pBD10.
TI  - Identification of the promoter for a peptide antibiotic biosynthesis gene from Bacillus brevis and its regulation in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Tyrocidine is a cyclic decapeptide antibiotic which is produced and secreted by stationary-phase cells of the sporeforming bacterium Bacillus brevis. We identified the promoter for the B. brevis structural gene (tycA) for tyrocidine synthetase I, the enzyme catalyzing the first step in tyrocidine biosynthesis, and studied its regulation in cells of B. brevis and Bacillus subtilis. Transcription from the tycA promoter was induced at the end of the exponential phase of the growth cycle in B. brevis cells growing in sporulation medium. To study the regulation of tycA in B. subtilis, we constructed a derivative of the B. subtilis bacteriophage SP beta containing a transcriptional fusion of the tycA promoter to the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli and introduced the tycA-lacZ operon fusion by means of specialized transduction into sporulation mutants known to be blocked in sporulation-associated antibiotic production. Our principal finding was that tycA-directed lacZ expression was impaired in the stage-0 mutants with mutations spo0A, spo0B, and spo0E but not in spo0C, spo0F, spo0H, or spo+ bacteria. The dependence on the spo0A gene product could be entirely bypassed by an abrB suppressor mutation, which caused tycA-lacZ to be transcribed constitutively at all stages of growth. A simple model is proposed for the mechanism of tycA induction based on the Spo0A-dependent inactivation of Ab-B protein, which is proposed to be a negative regulator of tycA transcription.
TI  - Antibiotic activity of the pyrenocines.
AB  - Pyrenocine A, a phytotoxin produced by Pyrenochaeta terrestris (Hansen) Gorenz, Walker and Larson, possesses general antibiotic activity against plants, fungi, and bacteria. Effective doses for 50% inhibition (ED50s) are 4 micrograms/mL for onion seedling elongation; 14, 20, 20, and 25 micrograms/mL for the germination of asexual spores of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae, Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi, Mucor hiemalis, and Rhizopus stolonifer, respectively. Pyrenocine A also inhibits the linear mycelial growth of both P. terrestris and F. oxysporum with ED50s calculated as 77 and 54 micrograms/mL, respectively. Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to pyrenocine A than Gram-negative bacteria. ED50s are estimated as 30, 45, and 200 micrograms/mL for the inhibition of growth of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, respectively, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to those concentrations tested. Pyrenocine A acts primarily as a biostatic rather than a biocidal agent with all organisms tested showing some degree of recovery when released from pyrenocine A. Pyrenocines B and C show little antibiotic activity in the bioassays performed.
TI  - Sequence of the Ampullariella sp. strain 3876 gene coding for xylose isomerase.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for xylose isomerase from Ampullariella sp. strain 3876, a gram-positive bacterium, has been determined. A clone of a fragment of strain 3876 DNA coding for a xylose isomerase activity was identified by its ability to complement a xylose isomerase-defective Escherichia coli strain. One such complementation positive fragment, 2,922 nucleotides in length, was sequenced in its entirety. There are two open reading frames 1,182 and 1,242 nucleotides in length, on opposite strands of this fragment, each of which could code for a protein the expected size of xylose isomerase. The 1,182-nucleotide open reading frame was identified as the coding sequence for the protein from the sequence analysis of the amino-terminal region and selected internal peptides. The gene initiates with GTG and has a high guanine and cytosine content (70%) and an exceptionally strong preference (97%) for guanine or cytosine in the third position of the codons. The gene codes for a 43,210-dalton polypeptide composed of 393 amino acids. The xylose isomerase from Ampullariella sp. strain 3876 is similar in size to other bacterial xylose isomerases and has limited amino acid sequence homology to the available sequences from E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptomyces violaceus-ruber. In all cases yet studied, the bacterial gene for xylulose kinase is downstream from the gene for xylose isomerase. We present evidence suggesting that in Ampullariella sp. strain 3876 these genes are similarly arranged.
TI  - Construction of an excretion vector and extracellular production of human growth  hormone from Escherichia coli.
AB  - A new excretion vector, pEAP8, was constructed to develop an excretion system for Escherichia coli. This plasmid, derived from pEAP37, carried the weakly activated kil gene of plasmid pMB9 [Kobayashi et al., J. Bacteriol. 166 (1986) 728-732] and the penicillinase promoter and signal region of an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. to excrete foreign gene products. A gene for human growth hormone (hGH) was joined to this signal sequence through the HindIII site. The recombinant plasmid p8hGH1 thus constructed, was introduced into E. coli. The hybrid protein which was produced in E. coli carrying p8hGH1 was processed during transport through the inner membrane, with the mature hGH being excreted into the medium through the outer membrane which was made permeable by the action of the kil gene. The N-terminal amino acid sequence and the biological activity of the extracellular hGH were consistent with those of the authentic hGH.
TI  - Toxicity of paraquat to microorganisms.
AB  - The biochemical response of the microorganisms Lipomyces starkeyi (Lod & Rij), Escherichia coli K-12 W3110, Bacillus subtilis 168 (Marburg) and Pseudomonas sp. strain TTO1 to the presence of growth-inhibitory concentrations of paraquat was studied. Paraquat was added to each culture at a concentration previously determined to reduce the culture growth rate by up to 50%. The changes in activity of a number of enzymes previously shown to be associated with the defense of the mammalian system against the action of paraquat were studied. While the response of E. coli was in agreement with that found in other studies of this microorganism and supports a commonly accepted mechanism for paraquat toxicity, the results obtained with L. starkeyi, B. subtilis, and Pseudomonas sp. strain TTO1 suggest that other mechanisms exist for protection against the toxicity of paraquat.
TI  - Integrable alpha-amylase plasmid for generating random transcriptional fusions in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - An integrable plasmid, pOK4, which replicated independently in Escherichia coli was constructed for generating transcriptional fusions in vivo in Bacillus DNA. It did not replicate independently in Bacillus subtilis, but it could be made to integrate into the chromosome of B. subtilis if sequences homologous to chromosomal sequences were inserted into it. It had a selectable marker for chloramphenicol resistance and carried unique sites for EcoRI and SmaI just to the 5' side of a promoterless alpha-amylase gene from Bacillus licheniformis. When B. subtilis DNA fragments were ligated into one of these sites and the ligation mixture was used to transform an alpha-amylase-negative B. subtilis strain, chloramphenicol-resistant transformants could be isolated conveniently. Many of these were alpha-amylase positive, owing to the fusion of the plasmid amylase gene to chromosomal operons. In principle, because integration need not be mutagenic, it is possible to obtain fusions to any chromosomal operon. The site of each integration can be mapped, and the flanking sequences can be cloned into E. coli. The alpha-amylase gene can be used to detect regulated genes. We used it as an indicator to detect operons which are DNA-damage-inducible (din), and we identified insertions in both SP beta and PBSX prophages.
TI  - The nosocomial colonization of T. Bear.
AB  - A national effort to reduce nosocomial infections includes a program developed at the National Institutes of Health to encourage handwashing in hospitals and day care centers. The program promotes a symbolic teddy bear (T. Bear) with slogans to remind hospital personnel and patients to practice handwashing. One of the items used is a stuffed toy T. Bear to be dispensed to the hospitalized child. Considering the manner in which children handle stuffed toys, we suspected the T. Bear might serve as a "fomite" for transmission of nosocomial microbes. A prospective study of 39 sterilized T. Bears revealed that all became colonized with bacteria, fungi, or both within 1 week of hospitalization. Hospital acquired organisms cultured from the T. Bear included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha streptococci, Corynebacterium acnes, Micrococcus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp, and species of Candida, Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, Aspergillus and others. Concomitant cultures of the patients revealed similar isolates. Although the T. Bear handwashing campaign should not be discredited, the promotional toy may pose an unnecessary expense and hazard and should not be used in hospitals or day care centers.
TI  - Identification of Brucella abortus in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of cows, goats, and mice with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex immunoenzymatic staining technique.
AB  - An avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex immunoenzymatic staining technique was evaluated for light microscopic detection of Brucella organisms in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Tissues from cows, goats, and mice inoculated with B abortus strain 2308 were examined, using rabbit antiserum to Brucella cell surface protein as primary antibody. Stained organisms were identified histologically in tissue sections containing B abortus, as detected by bacteriologic examination of duplicate nonprocessed tissue samples. Bacillus sp, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pasteurella haemolytica, P multocida, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus sp, and Streptococcus sp did not stain with this system, using anti-Brucella cell surface protein primary antibody, thus indicating specificity for Brucella organisms.
TI  - Two-component regulatory systems responsive to environmental stimuli share strongly conserved domains with the nitrogen assimilation regulatory genes ntrB and ntrC.
AB  - We report that the ntrB and ntrC proteins of Bradyrhizobium sp. [Parasponia] strain RP501 share homology with other regulatory proteins. There is extensive conservation of C-terminal regions between products of RP501 ntrB; Klebsiella pneumoniae ntrB; Escherichia coli envZ, cpxA, and phoR; Agrobacterium tumefaciens virA; and, to a lesser extent, E. coli cheA. There is also extensive conservation of N-terminal regions between products of RP501 ntrC; K. pneumoniae ntrC; E. coli ompR, sfrA, phoB, cheY and cheB; Salmonella typhimurium cheB and cheY; Bacillus subtilis spoOA and spoOF; and A. tumefaciens virG. We propose that these regulatory genes comprise two-component regulatory systems that evolved from a common ancestral system that involved transduction of information about the status of the environment by one protein domain (the C-terminal regions conserved among ntrB, envZ, etc.) to a second one (the N-terminal region conserved among ntrC, ompR, etc.). The ntrC-set protein then acts upon a specific responding mechanism, typically as a transcriptional activator but also as an effector of the maturation of outer membrane proteins or as a modulator of the direction of flagella rotation.
TI  - Multispecific DNA methyltransferases from Bacillus subtilis phages. Properties of wild-type and various mutant enzymes with altered DNA affinity.
AB  - Temperate Bacillus subtilis phages SPR, phi 3T, rho 11 and SP beta code for DNA methyltransferases, each having multiple sequence specificities. The SPR wild-type and various mutant methyltransferases were overproduced 1000-fold in Escherichia coli and were purified by three consecutive chromatographic steps. The stable form of these multispecific enzymes in solution are monomers with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of about 50,000. The methyl-transfer kinetics of the SPR wild-type and mutant enzymes were determined with DNA substrates carrying either none or one of the three recognition sequences (GGCC, CCGG, CCATGG). Evaluation of the catalytic properties for DNA and S-adenosylmethionine binding suggested that the NH2-terminal part of the protein is important for both non-sequence-specific DNA binding and S-adenosylmethionine binding as well as transfer of methyl groups. On the other hand, mutations in the COOH-terminal part lead to weaker site-specific interactions of the enzyme. Antibodies raised against the purified SPR enzyme specifically immunoprecipitated the phi 3T, rho 11 and SP beta methyltransferases, bu failed to precipitate the chromosomally coded enzymes from B. subtilis (BsuRI) and B. sphaericus (BspRI). Immunoaffinity chromatography is an efficient purification step for the related phage methyltransferases.
TI  - Aerobic blood culturing in cows with coliform mastitis.
AB  - Aerobic culturing was performed on blood samples from 20 cows with coliform mastitis and signs of systemic illness, and on blood samples from 21 cows with mastitis caused by other agents. No bacteria other than the skin contaminant Bacillus sp were isolated from the blood.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the alkaline cellulase gene from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 1139.
AB  - The cellulase gene from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 1139 was cloned in Escherichia coli using pBR322. Plasmid pFK1 was isolated from transformants producing cellulase, and the cloned cellulase gene was found to be in a 4 X 6 kb HindIII fragment. The cellulase gene was subcloned in a functional state on a 2 X 9 kb DNA fragment and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The coding sequence showed an open reading frame encoding 800 amino acids. The pFK1-encoded cellulase had the same enzymic properties as the extracellular cellulase produced by the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 1139, but its Mr was slightly higher.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of Serratia protease gene.
AB  - The gene encoding an extracellular metalloproteinase from Serratia sp. E-15 has been cloned, and its complete nucleotide sequence determined. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence reveals that the mature protein of the Serratia protease consists of 470 amino acids with a molecular weight of 50,632. The G+C content of the coding region for the mature protein is 58%; this high G+C content is due to a marked preference for G+C bases at the third position of the codons. The gene codes for a short pro-peptide preceding the mature protein. The Serratia protease gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens; the former produced the Serratia protease in the cells and the latter in the culture medium. Three zinc ligands and an active site of the Serratia protease were predicted by comparing the structure of the enzyme with those of thermolysin and Bacillus subtilis neutral protease.
TI  - Nonrandom cosmid cloning and prophage SP beta homology near the replication terminus of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome.
AB  - From a library of Bacillus subtilis DNA cloned with the Escherichia coli cosmid vector pHC79, 85 recombinant cosmids containing DNA from near the replication terminus, terC, were identified. The DNA inserts of these cosmids were confined to three regions of a 350-kilobase segment of the chromosome extending from the left end of the SP beta prophage to approximately 75 kilobases on the right of terC. All B. subtilis genes known to reside in this segment, as well as the portion of the SP beta prophage that is expressed early in the lytic cycle of the phage, appeared to be absent from the library. A region of SP beta homology distinct from the prophage and just to the left of terC was identified.
TI  - Excretion of the penicillinase of an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. through the Escherichia coli outer membrane is caused by insertional activation of the kil gene in plasmid pMB9.
AB  - Most of the cloned penicillinase from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 170 and alkaline phosphatase were released into the culture medium by Escherichia coli strains bearing plasmid pEAP1 or pEAP2 (T. Kudo, C. Kato, and K. Horikoshi, J. Bacteriol. 156:949-951, 1983). We analyzed the basis for excretion of periplasmic enzymes in the cells bearing these plasmids. Several experiments such as subcloning, insertion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cartridge, and DNA sequencing were done. A dormant kil gene in plasmid pMB9 was expressed by a promoter of the inserted DNA fragment of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 170, and as a result, the outer membrane of E. coli became permeable, allowing the proteins to be excreted without cell lysis.
TI  - Purification and characterization of glutamine synthetase from the archaebacterium Methanobacterium ivanovi.
AB  - Glutamine synthetase (GS) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from the obligate anaerobic archaebacterium Methanobacterium ivanovi. The 130-fold-purified enzyme was obtained by heat treatment, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Like all other eubacterial GSs known so far, the GS of M. ivanovi was found to be a dodecamer of about 600,000 daltons composed of a single type of subunit. The enzyme was stable at 63 degrees C for 10 min and was not sensitive to oxygen. The isoelectric point was 4.6, and the optimum pH of gamma-glutamyltransferase activity was 8.0. The Km values for hydroxylamine, glutamine, and ADP in the transferase reaction were 6.8, 22.7, and 0.35 mM, respectively. L-Methionine-DL-sulfoximine strongly inhibited the activity. Like the GS from gram-positive bacteria, Anabaena sp., several yeasts, and mammals, the enzyme from M. ivanovi was not regulated by adenylylation as demonstrated by snake venom phosphodiesterase treatment. Inhibition of the transferase activity by L-alanine, glycine, L-histidine, and L-tryptophan was observed. L-Glutamine alone or in the presence of AMP did not inhibit the GS synthetic activity. The GS of Methanobacterium ivanovi did not cross-react with a variety of antisera against GS from Escherichia coli, Anabaena strain 7120, or Bacillus megaterium. Archaebacterial GS appears to be structurally and functionally similar to eubacterial GS in gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - Cloning and expression of Bacillus subtilis phage DNA methyltransferase genes in  Escherichia coli and B. subtilis.
AB  - The DNA methyltransferase (Mtase) genes of the temperate Bacillus subtilis phages SPR (wild type and various mutants), phi 3T, rho 11 and SP beta have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and B. subtilis host-plasmid vector systems. Mtase activity has been quantitated in these clones by performing in vitro methylation assays of cell-free extracts. The four-phage Mtase genes differ in the amount of Mtase synthesized when transcribed from their genuine promoters. In B. subtilis as well as in E. coli the SPR Mtase is always produced in smaller amounts than the other phage Mtases. Expression levels of the SPR Mtase are dependent on the strength of the upstream vector promoter sequences. Overproduction of the SPR wild-type and mutant enzymes was achieved in E. coli (inducible expression) by fusions to the lambda pL or the tac promoter and in B. subtilis (constitutive expression) by means of the phage SP02 promoter.
TI  - Complementation and characterization of chemotaxis mutants of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - A set of chemotaxis mutants of Bacillus subtilis was complemented by using SP beta c2 transducing bacteriophage either containing cloned segments of DNA or derived from abnormal excision of SP beta c2 dl2::Tn917 inserted into the chemotaxis region. Representative mutants were characterized in capillary assays for chemotaxis toward four amino acids and mannitol and in tethered-cell experiments for addition and removal of two attractants and two repellents. Twenty complementation groups were identified, in addition to the cheR previously characterized. All were found to be defective in chemotaxis toward all chemoeffectors. They were assigned the names cheA through cheU. The large number of general chemotaxis genes in B. subtilis, in contrast to the six in Escherichia coli, suggests fundamental differences in the mechanism of chemotaxis in the two species.
TI  - A note on antibiotic resistance in the bacterial flora of raw sewage and sewage-polluted River Tigris in Mosul, Iraq.
AB  - Polluted water samples collected from the River Tigris in the vicinity of a raw sewage outfall were examined for the incidence of antibiotic resistance among coliform bacteria on three occasions during 1983. Eighty percent or more of the coliform bacteria were resistant to one or more antibiotics. At the same time, raw sewage samples were examined for the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were selected for sensitivity testing. Collectively, more than 90% of the 480 strains of the three organisms were resistant to one or more antibiotics. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin for twenty-nine strains including coliforms, E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., Ps. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas sp., Micrococcus sp., Staph. aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus sp. from raw sewage and polluted River Tigris water was determined and that for Ps. aeruginosa was 250 micrograms/ml. The high incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in natural waters could be related to the widespread use of antibiotics in this locality.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of the xylanase gene of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene for xylanase A of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125 was cloned in Escherichia coli with pBR322. The plasmid pCX311 contained 2.6- and 2.0-kilobase-pair HindIII fragments. The characteristics of the purified pCX311-encoded xylanase were the same as those of purified xylanase A from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125.
TI  - DNA methyltransferase genes of Bacillus subtilis phages: structural relatedness and gene expression.
AB  - The DNA methyltransferase (Mtase) genes of temperate Bacillus subtilis phages phi 3T, rho 11 and SP beta were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Each gene specifies a 47-kDa1 protein, which modifies BsuR (GGCC) and Fnu4HI (GCNGC) target sequences. Transcription is controlled by phage promoters located on the cloned fragments. The direction of transcription and the approximate position of the Mtase genes were determined. DNA/DNA hybridization experiments revealed close structural relatedness of the phi 3T, rho 11 and SP beta genes. A significant degree of homology was also found among these genes and the Mtase gene of related phage SPR, which codes for an enzyme with different modification specificity. These results suggest a common ancestor of the different phage Mtase genes. Phage Z, the only BsuR-sensitive member of this phage group, lacks a modification gene, but contains regions homologous to sequences flanking the SPR, phi 3T, rho 11 and SP beta Mtase genes.
TI  - Minimum bacterial density for bacteriophage replication: implications for significance of bacteriophages in natural ecosystems.
AB  - Bacteriophage 80 alpha did not increase in number in cultures containing less than about 1.0 X 10(4) to 1.5 X 10(4) CFU of Staphylococcus aureus per ml, but bacteriophage replication did occur when the number of bacteria exceeded this density, either initially or as a result of host cell multiplication. The minimum density of an asporogenous strain of Bacillus subtilis required for an increase in the number of bacteriophage SP beta cI was about 3 X 10(4) CFU/ml. The threshold density of Escherichia coli for the multiplication of bacteriophage T4 was about 7 X 10(3) CFU/ml. In the presence of montmorillonite, bacteriophage T4 did not increase in number until the E. coli population exceeded 10(4) CFU/ml. The mineralization of glucose was not affected in E. coli cultures inoculated with a low number of bacteriophage T4, but it could not be detected in cultures inoculated with a large number of phage. The numbers of bacteriophage T4 and a bacteriophage that lyses Pseudomonas putida declined rapidly after being added to lake water or sewage. We suggest that bacteriophages do not affect the number or activity of bacteria in environments where the density of the host species is below the host cell threshold of about 10(4) CFU/ml.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of cellulase genes of alkalophilic Bacillus sp.  strain N-4 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The genes for cellulases of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain N-4 were cloned in Escherichia coli with pBR322. Plasmids pNK1 and pNK2 were isolated from the transformants producing carboxymethyl cellulase, and the carboxymethyl cellulase genes cloned were in 2.0- and 2.8-kilobase-pair HindIII fragments, respectively. On the DNA level, the pNK1 fragment had a different restriction map from that of the pNK2 fragment, but the genomic hybridization experiments showed partial homology among these fragments. A total of 74 and 34% of the enzyme activities were observed in the periplasmic space of E. coli carrying the plasmids pNK1 and pNK2 , respectively. The carboxymethyl cellulase thus produced had broad pH activity curves (pH of 5 to 10.9) and was stable up to 75 degrees C.
TI  - [Effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  - Bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. Of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains, the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Streptococcus sanguis, S. saprophyticus, S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Actinomyces viscosus, Veillonella sp., Enterobacter liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica. Lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. Proteus vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica and Chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. The yeasts Endomyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. The kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
TI  - Bacterial interference with coliform colony sheen production on membrane filters.
AB  - The membrane filter (MF) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified Endo medium at 35 degrees C for 22 h. Large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (SPC) technique, can interfere with the detection of coliforms on MF. This paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific SPC bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on MF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in Escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. The Flavobacterium sp. and Bacillus sp. selected for this study from SPC did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. Excessive crowding of E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae colonies on MF also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. Even when there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the E. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified Endo medium.
TI  - Experimental evidence for the occurrence in honey of specific substances active against microorganisms.
AB  - Numbers of micro-organisms in sewage, soil, air and tap-water counted on media containing honey were lower than those counted on the same media containing equivalent concentrations of the sugars known to occur in honey. Similar experiments achieved with specific micro-organisms showed that honey had more pronounced inhibitory effects than the equivalent sugar solutions on Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum, but not on Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These results are understood in view of the occurrence in honey of specific compounds active mainly against Gram negative bacteria and higher fungi.
TI  - Excretion of the penicillinase of an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. through the Escherichia coli outer membrane.
AB  - Two plasmids containing the penicillinase gene of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 170, pEAP1 and pEAP2, were constructed. Most of the penicillinase produced by Escherichia coli, which carried these plasmids, was found in the culture medium. This excretion is caused by the cloned DNA fragment which contains some component that changes the outer membrane of E. coli.
TI  - Cloning DNA from the replication terminus region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome.
AB  - DNA from the Bacillus subtilis 168 prototroph, SB19, was partially cleaved with MboI and cloned into the BamHI site of the Escherichia coli cosmid vector, pHC79. [3H]thymine-labelled DNA from the replication terminus region of the B. subtilis dna-1 chromosome was used to identify, by hybridization, clones harboring recombinant cosmids carrying inserts from the terminus region. Restriction maps have been constructed for two such cosmids carrying overlapping DNA inserts that cover or extend into four of the previously identified five SalI fragments which are replicated last. The composite map of the cloned region, together with the available data on the replication order of fragments within it, is consistent with its replication being achieved by the unidirectional movement of a fork through it and towards the late replicating 16.2-kb SalI fragment. Most, if not all, of the terminus sequences in at least one of the recombinant cosmids are missing from a viable strain of B. subtilis that carries a deletion in the SP beta-gltA region of the chromosome.
TI  - A rapid and sensitive paper electrophoresis assay for the detection of microbial  siderophores elicited in solid-plating culture.
AB  - A rapid and sensitive assay for the detection of microbial siderophores (iron-binding compounds) is described. Nine representative fungal and bacterial cultures including Ustilago sphaerogena, Penicillium sp., Fusarium roseum, Rhodotorula pilimanae, Bacillus subtilis W 23, Bacillus subtilis W 168, Bacillus megaterium, Azotobacter vinelandii OP, and Escherichia coli B, were nutritionally stressed for iron by sequential transfers on iron-deficient solid-plating media. In response to Fe-stress conditions, the microorganisms excreted siderophore compounds into the extracellular solid culture medium. The solid agar matrix effectively concentrated and restricted the migration of the siderophore compounds to the region immediately adjacent to colonial growth. Agar-block samples from this region were removed and placed at the origin of an electrophoresis paper strip. The resultant absorbed material from the agar-block sample was subjected to high-voltage paper electrophoresis which separated the siderophore compounds by size and molecular net charge. Phenolic acid ("catechol")-type siderophores were detected by fluorescence under uv light. Hydroxamic acid-type siderophores were visualized by spraying the electrophoretogram with ferric iron solution.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - Survival and implantation of Escherichia coli in the intestinal tract.
AB  - Preliminary experiments established that a 0.5-ml inoculum that is introduced directly into the stomach of mice was cleared rapidly into the small intestine. Bicarbonate buffer, but not skim milk, protected such an inoculum from stomach acid until at least 90% of it had entered the small intestine. Passage and survival of various Escherichia coli strains through the mouse gut were tested by introducing a buffered bacterial inoculum directly into the stomach, together with the following two intestinal tracers: Cr(51)Cl(3) and spores of a thermophilic Bacillus sp. Quantitative recovery of excreted bacteria was accomplished by collecting the feces overnight in a refrigerated cage pan. The data show that wild-type E. coli strains and E. coli K-12 are excreted rapidly (98 to 100% within 18 h) in the feces without overall multiplication or death. E. coli varkappa1776 and DP50supF, i.e., strains certified for recombinant DNA experiments underwent rapid death in vivo, such that their excretion in the feces was reduced to approximately 1.1 and 4.7% of the inoculum, respectively. The acidity of the stomach had little bactericidal effect on the E. coli K-12 strain tested, but significantly reduced the survival of more acidsensitive bacteria (Vibrio cholerae) under these conditions. Long-term implantation of E. coli strains into continuous-flow cultures of mouse cecal flora or into conventional mice was difficult to accomplish. In contrast, when the E. coli strain was first inoculated into sterile continuous-flow cultures or into germfree mice, which were subsequently associated with conventional mouse cecal flora, the E. coli strains persisted in a large proportion of the animals at levels resembling E. coli populations in conventional mice. Metabolic adaptation contributed only partially to the success of an E. coli inoculum that was introduced first. A mathematical model is described which explains this phenomenon on the basis of competition for adhesion sites in which an advantage accrues to the bacterium which occupies those sites first. The mathematical model predicts that two or more bacterial strains that compete in the gut for the same limiting nutrient can coexist, if the metabolically less efficient strains have specific adhesion sites available. The specific rate constant of E. coli growth in monoassociated gnotobiotic mice was 2.0 h(-1), whereas the excretion rate in conventional animals was -0.23 h(-1). Consequently, limitation of growth must be regarded as the primary mechanism controlling bacterial populations in the large intestine. The beginnings of a general hypothesis of the ecology of the large intestine are proposed, in which the effects of the competitive metabolic interactions described earlier are modified by the effects of bacterial association with the intestinal wall.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of two modification methylase genes of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Two modification methylase genes of Bacillus subtilis R were cloned in Escherichia coli by using a selection procedure which is based on the expression of these genes. Both genes code for DNA-methyltransferases which render the DNA of the cloning host E. coli HB101 insensitive to the BspRI (5'-GGCC) endonuclease of Bacillus sphaericus R. One of the cloned genes is part of the restriction-modification (RM) system BsuRI of B. subtilis R with specificity for 5'-GGCC. The other one is associated with the lysogenizing phage SP beta B and produces the methylase M.BsuP beta BI with specificity for 5'-GGCC. The fragment carrying the SP beta B-derived gene also directs the synthesis in E. coli of a third methylase activity (M.BsuP beta BII), which protects the host DNA against HpaII and MspI cleavage within the sequence 5'-CCGG. Indirect evidence suggests that the two SP beta B modification activities are encoded by the same gene. No cross-hybridization was detected either between the M.BsuRI and M.BsuP beta B genes or between these and the modification methylase gene of B. sphaericus R, which codes for the enzyme M.BspRI with 5'-GGCC specificity.
TI  - Microbiological sampling of towels: comparison of 7 methods.
AB  - Pull-out roller towels were infected with bacteria and examined with 5 non-destructive methods. In addition to three traditional methods, the agar contact method (A), the swab method (S) and the tape method (T), two lesser known methods have been applied: the rinsing box method (R), new developed in the laboratory, and the filter method (F). In the first (R), the towel is fixed between the lid and the cup of a metal box containing a rinsing liquid; shaking the box completes the test. In the second (F) the liquid is forced through the towel by vacuum. In both experiments the rinsing liquid is tested for contamination. Destructive methods, mainly with a peristaltic blender ("stomacher") (P) or rotary mixer (M), were used as reference for calculating ratios of recovery. With the methods A, S and T, a low ratio of recovery, resp. 5, 10 and 2%, was obtained for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. With method R, ratios for the two species were 60-90%, and also for a Micrococcus species and for spores of Bacillus subtilis. With method F the ratio for E. coli and Micrococcus sp. was even slightly higher than 100%. Recovery with method M was about the same as with P. It is concluded that the rinsing box method as well as the filter method are well suited to the purpose of microbiologically testing towels; the lower recovery of the first is compensated by its simplicity.
TI  - Host-Pathogen Interactions : XVIII. ISOLATION AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF GLYCINOL, A PTEROCARPAN PHYTOALEXIN SYNTHESIZED BY SOYBEANS.
AB  - A previously unrecognized phytoalexin has been isolated from soybean cotyledons that had been infected with bacteria or exposed to ultraviolet light. The phytoalexin has been purified to homogeneity by silica gel flash chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography. It has been structurally characterized by its ultraviolet, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, polarimetry, and its mass spectrometric fragmentation pattern. The phytoalexin, (6aS,11aS)-3,6a,9-trihydroxypterocarpan, is a compound that had previously been detected in CuCl(2)-treated soybeans and is structurally related to the previously identified soybean phytoalexins glycerollins I to IV. It is proposed that the trivial name glycinol be used for this phytoalexin. Glycinol is a broad spectrum antibiotic capable of prolonging the lag phase of growth of all six bacteria examined, namely Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas glycinea (races 1 and 3), Escherichia coli, Xanthomonas phaseoli, and Bacillus subtilis. Glycinol also inhibits the growth of the fungi Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. glycinea (race 1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Cladosporium cucumerinum. Glycinol is a static agent against the six bacterial species listed above and against S. cerevisiae, and appears to be static against the other fungi examined. As with other phytoalexins, there is no correlation between the pathogenicity of a microorganism and its sensitivity to glycinol.
TI  - Goiter prevalence and bacterial contamination of water supplies.
AB  - Previous epidemiological studies have shown a significant statistical correlation (P < 0.005 to P < 0.0005) between goiter prevalence and rock types in the watersheds that supply 37 localities in Western Columbia. Bacterial contamination has also been implicated as a cause of endemic goiter. We, therefore, did bacteriological studies to incorporate this variable into the statistical model in 34 of the 37 localities previously surveyed. Samples of the water in the 34 localities were taken at the water source or intake of water supply and at the pipeline system in households and schools. Samples were collected in sterile bottles and cultured on several media for 48 h. The number of bacteria per ml was determined by Quebec's camera and the bacteria (E. coli, Bacillus sp., K. pneumoniae, Proteus sp., and Neisseria sp.) were identified according to conventional methods. Multiple regression analysis and the logistic regression model were used to analyze the data. Only two variables had significant relationships with goiter prevalence: K. pneumoniae in the water source (P < 0.01) is related to a lower prevalence and the overall concentration of bacteria in the pipeline system (P < 0.05) is related to a higher prevalence. Multiple regression analysis to compare the effects of bacteriological variables to those of geological variables indicating rock types showed sedimentary rocks in the watershed associated (P < 0.005) with higher goiter prevalence and an increased concentration of K. pneumoniae in the water source again associated (P < 0.025) with lower goiter prevalence. Bacterial concentration in the pipeline system was of marginal importance (0.05 < P < 0.10). Thus, the presence of sedimentary rocks was the best indicator of disease. A second best indicator was the concentration of K. pneumoniae in the water source. We hypothesize that the lower goiter prevalence associated with K. pneumoniae may be a natural example of biodegradation of the organic contaminants that produce goiter.
TI  - Two glutamine synthetases from Bacillus caldolyticus, an extreme thermophile. Isolation, physicochemical and kinetic properties.
AB  - Two distinctly different glutamine synthetase enzymes (EI and EII) have been isolated from the extreme thermophile Bacillus caldolyticus, grown on chemically defined medium at 70 degrees C. Purification to homogeneity mainly involves affinity chromatography and heat treatment with substrate protection. Biosynthesis of total enzyme activity can be repressed by at least 8-fold by high ammonia, with synthesis of EI being repressed more strongly than EII. A variety of chemical and biochemical tests failed to provide evidence for regulation of EI or EII by covalent modification, e.g. proteolysis, phosphorylation, or adenylylation. Neither of the thermophiic enzymes will cross-react with antibodies for the Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis glutamine synthetases. Both enzymes are composed of 12 subunits, each approximately 51,000 daltons. However, EI and EII differ significantly in their amino acid composition, isoelectric points (5.2 and 5.5, respectively), rates of migration on polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels at pH 6.8, and kinetic properties, EI is more active with Mg(II) than with Mn(II), but EII is more active with Mn(II) than Mg(II). Cd(II) activates EII more than EI, and only EI shows activity with Co(II). For both enzymes, the Mn(II)-stimulated activity is optimal at pH 6.0 to 6.5, with Mn(II)/ATP = 1.0, but the pH optimum with Mg(II) is near pH 7.5, however, with a ratio of Mg(II)/ATP > 2. Substrate Km values at 70 degrees C differ for EI versus EII but are quite comparable to those seen for mesophilic glutamine synthetases. Studies with structural analogs of substrates indicate that active site specificity is maintained at extreme temperatures: substitution of alpha-OH for alpha-HN2 is allowed, but unfavorable changes occur upon substitution of methyl groups for the alpha-H or onto the alpha-NH2 of L-Glu, and for D-Glu or L-Asp. EII is almost absdolutely specific for ATP, but EI can also use ITP, GTP, and UTP as substrates to some extent. The divalent metal ion that is present can affect both specificity for analogs and substrate Km values. Kinetic binding plots (v versus [S]) are biphasic for NH3 and L-Glu with the more active forms of each enzyme, EI-Mg and EII-Mn, respectively; but no positive cooperativity is observed. ATP binding is strictly hyperbolic, in contrast to the positive cooperativity previously observed with other Bacillus sp. enzymes. For purified EI and EII, Arrhenius plots are nonlinear with Mn(II) or Mg(II), exhibiting slope changes in the range of 55-65 degrees C; however, for EI-EII mixtures in crude cell extracts these plots are nearly linear.
TI  - The site of inhibition of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis by azureomycin B, a new antibiotic.
AB  - Azureomycin B (10 micrograms/ml), a new antibiotic from Pseudonocardia azurea nov. sp., caused the accumulation of lipid intermediate and inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in an invitro system using a particulate fraction from Bacillus megaterium KM with UDP-MurNAc-[3H]pentapeptide and cold UDP-GlcNac or cold UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc as substrates. At higher concentrations of azureomycin B (over 100 microgram/ml), lipid intermediate accumulation was also inhibited. When particulate fraction from Escherichia coli Y-10 and UDP-[14C[GlcNAc and cold UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide were used, accumulation of lipid intermediate and inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis were also observed. These results indicate that the primary target of azureomycin B is the transfer of the disaccharide peptide unit (GlcNAc-MurNAc-pentapeptide) from lipid-bound precursor to acceptor.
TI  - Controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  - A cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. Shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through a short orifice. If the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. The disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by Stansted Fluid Power Limited, Stansted, England. Phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including Chlorella, Aspergillus fumigatis, Fusarium sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus zooepidermicus and Staphylococcus aureus. The cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. The applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. The case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. Furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.
TI  - Effects of changes in Mg++ ion concentration upon bacterial inhibition by beta-2-thienylalanine in defined media.
AB  - Variation in the inhibition of growth of Escherichia coli and Shigella sp. in various media containing beta-2-thienylalanine was attributed to differences in concentrations of Mg++ ions. Random blood samples 112 infants were tested for elevated phenylalanine in the phenylketonuria (PKU) screening assay. Magnesium ion levels also affected the results of this assay. At 0.05 g/1 MgSO4, the concentration present in commerical PKU test agar, four false positives were detected, while no readings could be made due to overgrowth of the Bacillus subtilis test strain when the concentration was increased to 0.1 g/1.
TI  - The nucleotide sequence of formylmethionine tRNA from Mycoplasma mycoides sp. capri.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of Mycoplasma mycoides sp. capri PG3 formylmethionine tRNA has been determined, using in vitro labeling techniques, to be pC-G-C-G-G-G-G-s4U-A-G-A-G-C-A-G-U-D (U)-G-G-D-A-G-C-U-C-G-C-C-G-G-G-C-U-C-A-U-A-A-C-C-C-G-G-A-G-G-C-C-G-C-A-G-G-U-psi - C-G-A-G-U-C-C-U-G-C-C-C-C-C-G-C-A-A-C-C-AOH. This tRNA contains only three modified nucleosides s4U, D and psi, all of which are derived from uridine. Both in the structural features which distinguish eukaryotic from prokaryotic initiator RNAs and in the overall sequence, this tRNA resembles a typical prokaryotic initiator tRNA. A comparison of the sequence of this tRNA with those of other prokaryotic initiator tRNAs suggests that taxonomically the Mycoplasma may be less related to the Cyanophyta (Anacystis nidulans) than to the bacteria and less related to the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli) than to the Bacillaceae (Bacillus subtilis).
TI  - Microbial conversion of DL-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid to L-cysteine and L-cystine: screening of microorganisms and identification of products.
AB  - Microorganisms able to form L-cysteine from DL-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (DL-ATC), a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of DL-cysteine, were isolated from soil samples and classified as Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas cohaerens, P. desmolytica, and P. ovalis. Thirteen L-cysteine-producing bacteria were also found in among 463 stock cultures representing 37 genera. These were Achromobacter delmarvae. Alcaligenes denitrificans, Bacillus brevis, Brevibacterium flavum, Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia carotovora, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus sodonensis, Myocoplana dimorpha, Sarcina lutea, Serratia marcescens, Flavobacterium acidoficum, and Pseudomonas ovalis. In the presence of intact cells of Pseudomonas sp. AJ 3854, 6.1 mg of L-cysteine and/or L-cystine per ml was produced from 10 mg of DL-ATC-3H2O per ml in a molar yield of 100%. This finding suggests that racemization and asymmetric hydrolysis occurred simultaneously in this incubation mixture. After the complete oxidation of cysteine to cystine by aeration in the presence of ferrous ion, crystalline cystine was isolated; its configuration was the L isomer based on data from X-ray diffraction, microbioassay, and optical rotation studies.
TI  - [Behavior of some microorganisms cultivated in the presence of irradiated maize starch].
AB  - The bactericidal effect of water soluble radiolysis products of Maize starch on Escherichia coli cultures declines when the initial population grows. This toxicity varies with the culture environment and the bacterial species: Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus faecalis, Enterobacter sp. Moreover, for the eucaryote cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild strain or muting "small colonies", only the generating time is altered by the active parts of radiolysis products. The results are analysed with regard to the hypothesis that the hydrogen peroxide is responsible for this toxicity.
TI  - A simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the Caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  - An efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of Caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. The Caesarean-derived infant Dutch or Japanese-White rabbits and their hybrids (F1; Japanese-White female x Dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, A and B, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (Esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (Table 2) and administered intragastrically once a day through a Nelaton's catheter. Bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. On the third day, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. The weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (Table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of Esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. There was, however, no significant difference milk diet A and B on the weaning rate.
TI  - Biological values of the infant, juvenile, and adult agouti (Dasyprocta sp) with  emphasis on microbial flora.
AB  - Normal values for intestinal flora were determined on four adult, two juvenile, and four infant agoutis (Dasyprocta sp) maintained at our institution. Serologic, hematologic, biochemical, and histologic observations were also made on these same agoutis, and serologic, microbiologic, and endoparasitic tests were made on serum and fecal samples from agoutis maintained at other institutions. Streptococci, lactobacilli and nonenteropathogenic Escherichia coli were isolated from cecal contents of all age groups. Gaffkya tetragena and Bacillus sp were recovered from infant agoutis, Proteus mirabilis from juvenile agoutis, and Proteus mirabilis and Micrococcus sp from adult agoutis. Infant agoutis showed marginal antibody titers to reovirus type 3 and Toolan's H-1 viruses, and Theiler's GDVII antibodies were detected in juvenile agoutis, but no antibody titers to murine viruses were found in the adult agoutis maintained at our institution. Hematologic, biochemical, and histologic data for these agoutis were comparable to those of other hystricomorph rodents. Serologic tests of the agoutis maintained at other institutions disclosed antibodies for GDVII virus in all of 17 animals tested, while marginal titers were found for Sendai virus in four and for reovirus type 3 in eight of the 17 animals. Only low incidences of pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Citrobacter) were isolated from the agoutis maintained elsewhere. The endoparasites found in these agoutis were Ascaris, Toxascaris, Strongyloides, Trichuris, and Trichomonas.
TI  - Platomycins A and B I Taxonomy of the producing strain and production, isolation  and biological properties of platomycins.
AB  - Two new antibiotics, platomycins A and B, belonging to the phleomycin-bleomycin family, were isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptosporangium sp. MK-78. This strain has been identified as a new variety of Streptosporangium violaceochromogenes. Both platomycins A and B are active against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and also inhibit solid Sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the hemolymph of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus: numerical taxonomy.
AB  - Bacteria isolated from the hemolymph of normal blue crabs were found to be predominantly Vibrio sp., Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus sp., Flavobacterium sp., and coliforms. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a cosmopolitan facultative pathogen widely implicated in outbreaks of gastroenteritis related to the consumption of improperly processed seafood, was present in crabs collected between the months of May to November and was identified in up to 21% of the hemolymphs sampled.
TI  - Distribution of the isopropylmalate pathway to leucine among diverse bacteria.
AB  - alpha-Isopropylmalate synthase and beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase activities  were detected in extracts of the following organisms: Chromatium D, Rhodopseudomonas spheroides, Hydrogenomonas H16, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Vibrio extorquens, Rhizobium japonicum, Alcaligenes viscolactis, Escherichia coli B, Proteus vulgaris, Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Micrococcus sp., Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Bacillus polymyxa, Bacillus subtilis, and Nocardia opaca. The alpha-isopropylmalate synthase activity in these extracts was inhibited by low concentrations of l-leucine. Taken together with other data, these results suggest that the isopropylmalate pathway is widespread among organisms that can synthesize leucine.
TI  - Comparison of acetohydroxy-acid synthetases from two extreme thermophilic bacteria.
AB  - The acetohydroxy-acid synthetases from two extreme bacterial thermophiles, Thermus aquaticus and Bacillus sp., have been studied. The two enzymes have different pH optima, 8 and 6, respectively, and both are feedback inhibited by valine. The inhibition is of interest because it is not expressed below 60 C, but only at higher temperatures which are optimal for catalytic activity. Valine inhibition in T. aquaticus was noncompetitive, whereas in Bacillus sp., it was competitive. Isoleucine (10(-3) M) also inhibited the two enzymes, whereas leucine (10(-3) M) did not. There was no concerted feedback when the amino acids were added in together. The sensitivity of the enzymes to valine could not be removed by HgCl(2). Both enzymes required Mg(2+) and thiamine pyrophosphate for optimal activity, whereas only the enzyme from T. aquaticus required flavine adenine dinucleotide in addition. None of these cofactors was essential for the feedback inhibition caused by valine. The enzymes from both bacteria could be repressed, but only in the presence of all three branched-chain amino acids indicating that, as in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, the repression system is multivalent.
TI  - Physical characterization of DNA from bacteriophage SP 3 .
TI  - Streptomyces torulosus sp. n., an unusual knobby-spored taxon.
AB  - Several strains of a streptomycete with unusual spore wall ornamentation were isolated from Iowa soils. They are further characterized by coiled chains of spores, gray aerial mycelium, melanin-like pigments, and the production of antibacterial and antifungal antibiotics. Spore wall ornamentations, as seen with the transmission electron microscope, do not correspond with any of the four generally recognized categories of spore wall ornamentation-smooth, warty, spiny, or hairy-but seem to represent an intermediate position between warty and spiny. This unusual ornamentation consists of blunt projections rising out of an otherwise smooth surface and is termed "knobby." To obtain further information on the nature of the knoblike projections and their possible status in representing a defined spore wall ornamentation category, scanning electron micrographs and transmission electron micrographs representing all sporewall ornamentation categories were compared. Differentiation between the several categories was more difficult with the scanning electron microscope than with the transmission electron microscope.
TI  - [Study of the chemical composition of aspergin--a metabolite from Aspergillus sp].
TI  - Inhibition of the plaquing efficiency of T4r+ bacteriophage by subtilisin.
AB  - The mechanism by which the replicative cycle of T4r(+) phage is inhibited by certain nonhost bacterial systems was investigated. Some Bacillaceae, especially Bacillus subtilis, decreased the plaquing efficiency of this virus more than 95% within 24 hr of exposure. Sarcina lutea and Micrococcus sp. both failed to cause any significant change in the infectivity of T4r(+) phage. Preliminary investigations into the nature of the inhibitory substance(s) suggested that an extracellularly elicited protein was at least partially responsible for this effect. Further analysis has implicated subtilisin, an exoprotease from B. subtilis, as the cause of some, if not all, of the observed decrease in plaquing efficiency. Gel-filtration chromatography of control and treated (14)C-labeled T4r(+) phage showed a wide dispersal of phage-specific material of these particles after 24 hr of exposure to pure subtilisin or to expended medium exoprotease from B. subtilis. It was concluded that B. subtilis exoprotease is capable of chemically altering the structure of the phage capsid, thus causing a decrease in its plaquing efficiency.
TI  - The effect of Pneumostrongylus tenuis (Nematoda: Metastrongyloidea) on kids.
AB  - Kids, 6-28 weeks of age, infected with 200-1000 infective larvae of meningeal worm (Pneumostrongylus tenuis) of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), developed colitis and peritonitis. Bacteroides sp., Bacillus sp., Escherichia coli, Proteus sp. and Enterococcus sp. were found in the peritoneal cavity. Most kids were moribund or dead 4-11 days after infection and frequently the colon had ruptured. Only two kids (of 11) in which the disease was allowed to run its course survived colitis and peritonitis but these two animals developed severe neurologic signs 18 and 38 days after infection. Numerous developing worms and various traumatic and other lesions were found in the central nervous system of kids which developed neurologic signs.
TI  - Nucleoside antibiotics. 3. Isolation, structural elucidation and biological properties of 3'-acetamido-3'-deoxyadenosine from Helminthosporium sp. 215.
TI  - Tryptophanase in diverse bacterial species.
AB  - The distribution of tryptophanase was studied. The highest observed specific activity, mumoles per minute per milligram (dry weight) cells, is given in parentheses after each species. Tryptophanase was inducible and repressible in Escherichia coli (.914), Paracolobactrum coliforme (.210), Proteus vulgaris (.146), Aeromonas liquefaciens (.030), Photobacterium harveyi (.035), Sphaerophorus varius (.021), Bacteroides sp. (.048), and Corynebacterium acnes (.042). The enzyme was constitutive and nonrepressible in Bacillus alvei (.013), and was inducible but not repressible by glucose in Micrococcus aerogenes (.036). Indole-positive bacteria were found in fecal or intestinal samples from a variety of animals among the mammals, reptiles, insects, molluscs, fish, crustaceans, and amphibians.
TI  - Studies on antibiotics produced from Kitasatoa kauaiensis sp. nov.
TI  - A new antibacterial agent produced by Streptomyces sp. Ac6-569.
TI  - Microflora of black and red pepper.
AB  - Dilution cultures of 30 samples of ground black pepper yielded an average of 39,000 colonies of fungi per g, with a range of 1,700 to 310,000 per g. Total numbers of colonies of bacteria from 11 samples averaged 194,000,000 per g, with a range from 8,300,000 to 704,000,000 per g. A variety of fungi grew from nearly all surface-disinfected whole peppercorns that were cultured. Thirteen samples of ground red pepper from the United States yielded an average of 1,600 colonies of storage fungi per g and an equal number of other fungi; five samples from India yielded an average of 78,900 colonies of storage fungi per g and 169,400 colonies of other fungi per g. Among the fungi from both black and red pepper were Aspergillus flavus and A. ochraceus, some isolates of which, when grown for 8 to 10 days on moist autoclaved corn and fed to white rats or to 2-day-old Pekin ducklings, were rapidly lethal to them. Aflatoxin B(1) was isolated from one of the samples of corn on which A. flavus from black pepper was grown. Among the bacteria isolated from ground black pepper were Escherichia coli, E. freudii, Serratia sp., Klebsiella sp., Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., and Streptococcus sp. No cultures of Shigella or Salmonella were found.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of the concentrated artificial kidney bath solution.
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the ability of a 30 times concentrated dialysate fluid to support or inhibit growth of bacteria, and to evaluate its shelf life. The solution was inoculated with the following organisms in the logarithmic-growth phase: Escherichia coli, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, enteric Streptococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella-Aerobacter sp., Proteus sp., and Bacillus subtilis. Inoculated concentrate held at 37 C showed an exponential decrease in organisms for all species except B. subtilis, with no organisms recoverable at 24 hr. To determine the effects of temperature, solution inoculated with E. coli and S. aureus was kept at 4 and 20 C. Lesser rates of bacterial decline were found at the lower temperatures, with some organisms surviving for 146 hr at 4 C. For the evaluation of shelf life, 2 liters of the solution was kept at room temperature in screw-cap bottles for 8 months; no bacterial growth occurred. The self-sterilizing property of this solution is important practically, since it removes another source of contamination from patients with reduced resistance to infection due to chronic renal disease or immunosuppressive therapy for renal homotransplantation.
TI  - COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF FIVE SELECTIVE AND DIFFERENTIAL MEDIA FOR THE DETECTION AND ENUMERATION OF COAGULASE-POSITIVE STAPHYLOCOCCI IN FOODS.
AB  - Five selective media for the detection and enumeration of coagulase-positive staphylococci were evaluated for their efficiency in the recovery of 17 strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci from foods. They were Staphylococcus Medium 110 (SM-110), tellurite-glycine-agar (TGA), egg-tellurite-glycine-pyruvate-agar (ETGPA), tellurite-egg-agar (TEA), and tellurite-polymyxin-egg yolk-agar (TPEY). Statistical analysis by the rank correlation method of the efficiency with which these media recovered staphylococci from pure 24-hr Brain Heart Infusion cultures revealed the following efficiencies in descending order: (i) TPEY, (ii) ETGPA, (iii) TGA, (iv) TEA, (v) SM-110. Growth of 17 strains of coagulase-negative cocci on these media showed the following approximate descending order of inhibition to these organisms: (i) ETGPA, (ii) TEA, (iii) SM-110, (iv) TGA, (v) TPEY. The appearance of colonies of the various coagulase-negative strains on each medium was studied for the degree to which they could be confused with colonies of coagulase-positive strains. Nineteen food contaminants, including Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus sp., Escherichia coli, Erwinia sp., fecal streptococci, and others, were also studied for similarities in appearance to staphylococci and for ability to grow on the selective media. The influence of five sterile food homogenates (frozen chicken and tuna pies, custard, smoked ham, and raw whole egg) on recovery of 1,500 enterotoxigenic staphylococci (three strains) per milliliter was determined by statistical analysis. Three main effects (culture, media, and food) and three interactions (media with food, food with cultures, and media with culture) were found to be significant. Recovery on TPEY was influenced less by food than the other selective media and showed optimal recovery ability from sterile custard, eggs, and ham. TGA recovered well from sterile chicken pie and custard, SM-110 from sterile custard, and TEA from sterile ham. None of the media was outstanding in recovering staphylococci from tuna pie. The ability of the five selective media to recover 1,500 enterotoxigenic staphylococci (three strains) per ml from three sterile foods in the presence of 10 strains of contaminating bacteria added at the 0, 10(5), and 10(6) levels per milliliter was also studied and analyzed statistically. Only three factors were significant under these conditions-cultures, foods, and the interaction of media with the level of added contamination. Efficiency of recovery of TGA, SM-110, and ETGPA was found not to be dependent upon the level of contamination. Recovery on TPEY decreased with increases in the number of contaminants. TEA increased in efficiency at the 10(5) level, but decreased at the 10(6) level. When recovery on Trypticase Soy Agar was considered to be 100%, the average percentage of recovery by each of the selective media under all experimental conditions was determined.
TI  - PHENAZINES AND PHENOXAZINONES FROM WAKSMANIA AERATA SP. NOV. AND PSEUDOMONAS IODINA.
TI  - Repression of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. II. Causes of inhibition.
AB  - Two food bacteria, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas sp. CS-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. Five others, Bacillus cereus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli H-52, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were Seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 C for 10 min. Inhibition was not caused by changes in pH, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. The concentrated antibiotic material from E. coli H-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
