TI  == inclusion of chicory (cichorium intybus l.) in pigs' diets affects the intestinal microenvironment and the gut microbiota.
AB  == the content and composition of prebiotic plant fiber in the diet is important in  promoting gut-related health. this study investigated the effects of the dietary  inclusion of chicory forage and roots on the intestinal microenvironment of pigs. thirty-seven-week-old pigs were fed 1 of 5 diets for 18 days, including a cereal-based control diet and 4 diets with the inclusion of 80 and 160 g kg(-1) of body weight chicory forage (cf80 and cf160), 80 g kg(-1) chicory root (cr80),  and a mix of 80 g kg(-1) forage and 80 g kg(-1) chicory root (cfr). the animals maintained good performance and health irrespective of diet. bacterial community  structure and diversity in ileal and colonic samples was assessed using terminal  restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp), combined with cloning and sequencing. samples clustered perfectly according to gut segment with a higher bacterial diversity in colon than ileum. distal ileum was dominated by lactic acid bacteria (lab), and the relative amount of this group was increased by the cf160 and cfr diets. the colonic bacterial community was dominated by butyrate-producing bacteria and prevotella. the increased relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in the colon was positively correlated with the molar proportion of acetic acid and furthermore linked to the chicory forage diets (cf80 and cf160). diets including chicory roots (cr80 and cfr) were correlated with a higher colonic abundance of megasphaera elsdenii. the fermentation products and ph in digesta responded to diet type and were correlated with shifts in the microbiota, showing that chicory influences the intestinal microenvironment of pigs.

TI  == stimulation of butyrate production by gluconic acid in batch culture of pig cecal digesta and identification of butyrate-producing bacteria.
AB  == gluconic acid reaches the large intestine to stimulate lactic acid bacteria. however, the fermentation pattern of gluconic acid has yet to be elucidated. accordingly, we examined the fermentation properties induced by gluconic acid in  the pig cecal digesta in vitro. we also tested sorbitol and glucose, substrates for which the fermentation rate and patterns are known. the gluconic acid-utilizing bacteria were further isolated from pig cecal digesta and identified to examine the effect of gluconic acid on hind gut fermentation. gluconic acid was fermented more slowly than were the other two substrates. gluconic acid stimulated butyrate production; the butyrate molar percentage reached 26%, which is considered a high butyrate production. the majority of gluconic acid fermenters were identified as lactic acid bacteria, such as lactobacillus reuteri and l. mucosae, and acid-utilizing bacteria, such as megasphaera elsdenii and mitsuokella multiacida. the gluconic acid fermented by lactic acid bacteria, and the lactate and acetate that were produced were used to form butyrate by acid-utilizing bacteria, such as m. elsdenii. gluconic acid may  be useful as a prebiotic to stimulate butyrate production in the large intestine.
