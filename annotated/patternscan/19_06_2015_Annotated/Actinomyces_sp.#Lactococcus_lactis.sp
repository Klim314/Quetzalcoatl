TI  == streptococcus gordonii dl1 adhesin sspb v-region mediates coaggregation via receptor polysaccharide of actinomyces oris t14v.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii sspa and sspb proteins, members of the antigen i/ii (agi/ii) family of streptococcus adhesins, mediate adherence to cysteine-rich scavenger glycoprotein gp340 and cells of other oral microbial species. in this article we investigated further the mechanism of coaggregation between s. gordonii dl1 and actinomyces oris t14v. previous mutational analysis of s. gordonii suggested that sspb was necessary for coaggregation with a. oris t14v. we have confirmed this by showing that lactococcus lactis surrogate host cells expressing sspb coaggregated with a. oris t14v and pk606 cells, while l. lactis cells expressing sspa did not. coaggregation occurred independently of expression of a. oris type 1 (fimp) or type 2 (fima) fimbriae. polysaccharide was prepared from cells of a. oris t14v and found to contain 1,4-, 4,6- and 3,4-linked glucose, 1,4-linked mannose, and 2,4-linked galactose residues. when immobilized  onto plastic wells this polysaccharide supported binding of l. lactis expressing  sspb, but not binding of l. lactis expressing other agi/ii family proteins. purified recombinant navp region of sspb, comprising amino acid (aa) residues 41-847, bound a. oris polysaccharide but the c-domain (932-1470 aa residues) did  not. a site-directed deletion of 29 aa residues (delta691-718) close to the predicted binding cleft within the sspb v-region ablated binding of the navp region to polysaccharide. these results infer that the v-region head of sspb recognizes an actinomyces polysaccharide ligand, so further characterizing a lectin-like coaggregation mechanism occurring between two important primary colonizers.

TI  == differential binding specificities of oral streptococcal antigen i/ii family adhesins for human or bacterial ligands.
AB  == the antigen i/ii (agi/ii) family polypeptides, ranging from 1310 to 1653 amino acid (aa) residues, are cell wall anchored adhesins expressed by most indigenous  species of oral streptococci. the polypeptides interact with a wide range of host molecules, in particular salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (sag or gp340), and with ligands on other oral bacteria. to determine the receptor recognition properties of six different agi/ii family polypeptides from strains of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus mutans, the genes were cloned and expressed on the surface of the surrogate host lactococcus  lactis. the s. gordonii sspa and sspb polypeptides mediated higher binding levels of l. lactis cells to surface immobilized gp340 than did s. intermedius pas protein, or s. mutans spap or pac proteins. however, the agi/ii proteins were all similar in their abilities to mediate aggregation of lactococci by fluid phase gp340. the spap(i) polypeptide from s. mutans ingbritt, which was c-terminally truncated by approximately 400 aa residues, did not bind gp340. lactococci expressing agi/ii proteins, including spap(i), were aggregated by a synthetic 16  aa residue peptide srcrp2 derived from the aa repeat block sequences within gp340. in coaggregation assays, sspb from s. gordonii was unique in mediating coaggregation with only group a and group e strains of actinomyces naeslundii. all the other agi/ii polypeptides mediated coaggregation with group c and group d strains of a. naeslundii. analysis of chimeric protein constructs revealed that coaggregation specificity was determined by sequences within the n-terminal half  of agi/ii protein. a synthetic peptide (20 aa residues), which defines a putative adhesion epitope within the c-terminal region of polypeptide, inhibited agi/ii-mediated aggregation by gp340 but did not affect coaggregation with a. naeslundii. these results suggest that different mechanisms operate in interactions of agi/ii family polypeptides with native gp340, gp340 srcr domain peptide, and a. naeslundii. specificity of these interactions appears to be determined by discontinuous but interacting regions of the polypeptides, thus providing flexibility in receptor recognition for streptococcal colonization of the human host.

TI  == selection of dairy bacterial strains as probiotics for oral health.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to select bacterial strains with potential properties as oral probiotics, namely for the prevention of dental caries. we examined 23 dairy microorganisms, out of which we identified two streptococcus thermophilus and two lactcoccus lactis strains that were able to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads to the same extent as streptococcus sobrinus omz176. two of them, strep. thermophilus ncc1561 and lactoc. lactis ssp. lactis ncc2211, were further successfully incorporated into a biofilm mimicking the dental plaque. furthermore, they could grow in such a biofilm together with five  strains of oral bacterial species, representative of supragingival plaque. in this system, lactoc. lactis ncc2211 was able to modulate the growth of the oral bacteria, and in particular to diminish the colonization of streptococcus oralis  omz607, veillonella dispar omz493, actinomyces naeslundii omz745 and of the cariogenic strep. sobrinus omz176. these findings encourage further research with selected non-pathogenic dairy bacterial strains with the aim to decrease the cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

TI  == binding properties of streptococcus gordonii sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family)  polypeptides expressed on the cell surface of lactococcus lactis mg1363.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii expresses two cell wall-associated polypeptides, designated sspa (1,542 amino acid residues) and sspb (1,462 amino acid residues), that have 70% sequence identity. these polypeptides are members of the antigen i/ii family of oral streptococcal adhesins and mediate the binding of streptococci to salivary glycoproteins, collagen, and other oral microorganisms such as actinomyces naeslundii. to determine if sspa and sspb have differential binding properties, the coding sequences of the sspa and sspb genes  were cloned into expression plasmid vector ptrex1-usp45ls to generate ptrex1-sspa and ptrex1-sspb, respectively, and the ssp polypeptides were displayed on the cell surface of lactococcus lactis mg1363. lactococcal cells expressing similar levels of surface sspa or sspb polypeptide were then compared for their abilities to adhere to a range of antigen i/ii polypeptide substrates. more than twice as many l. lactis cells expressing sspa bound to immobilized salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (sag) as did l. lactis cells expressing sspb. in contrast, lactococci expressing sspb adhered twice as well as lactococci producing sspa to  collagen type i and to candida albicans. the binding of a. naeslundii to lactococci was only weakly enhanced by surface expression of ssp polypeptides. l. lactis(ptrex1-sspb) cells bound in greater numbers to sag than did enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 cells expressing sspb from pam401eb-5. the results suggest that sspa and sspb have markedly different binding affinities for their oral substrates and thus may function to promote site diversity in colonization by s.  gordonii.

TI  == [lytic enzymes produced by actinomyces levoris].
AB  == the composition of the enzyme complex produced by actinomyces levoris which exhibits lytic action on the cell walls of streptococcus lactis was studied by gel filtration on sephadex g-25, ion exchange chromatography and isoelectric focusing. the complex was found to contain at least seven enzymes having different isoelectric points and substrate specificity. the enzymes were divided  into three groups. (1) the enzyme with pi 10.2 seems to be a specific glucosidase; it possesses a high activity of the cell wall lysis and lacks a proteolytic activity. (2) the enzymes with pi 9.2 and 9.0 are, apparently, specific lytic proteases; they display both lytic and proteolytic activities. (3) the enzymes with pi 10.0, 9.5, 5.7 and 4.2 are, presumably, non-specific lytic proteases; they have a low lytic activity and a high proteolytic activity.
