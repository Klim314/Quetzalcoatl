TI  == bacteria trigger oxygen radical release and sperm lipid peroxidation in in vitro  model of semen inflammation.
AB  == objective: to assess the in vitro effect of five bacterial strains isolated from  semen samples (escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus oralis, bacteroides ureolyticus, and ureaplasma urealyticum) on reactive oxygen intermediate (roi) release and lipid sperm membrane peroxidation in the coincubated suspensions of white blood cells (wbc) with spermatozoa. design: an in vitro model of semen infection. setting: basic research laboratory. patient(s): healthy normozoospermic volunteers and healthy blood donors. intervention(s): none. main outcome measure(s): chemiluminescent assay was used to evaluate roi generation by wbc. malondialdehyde (mda) concentration was determined in sperm lysates using high-performance liquid chromatography. result(s): of the bacterial strains tested, b. ureolyticus, s. haemolyticus, and  e. coli caused the greatest damage to sperm membrane lipids. an increase in mda levels in sperm lysates was a natural consequence of bacteria-induced roi generation. the wbc usually enhanced harmful activity of the infectious agent toward the cell membranes. conclusion(s): the harmful effect of bacteria on spermatozoa depends on the type and species of microorganisms invading, colonizing, or infecting the male genital tract and is associated with the accompanying oxidative stress. the presence of leukocytes in semen appears to be  the additional factor enhancing the sperm lipid membrane peroxidation, which may  affect the fertility status.

TI  == bacterial 16s rdna polymerase chain reaction in the detection of intra-amniotic infection.
AB  == objective: bacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to detect early subclinical intraamhiotic infection. we used universal primers which amplify a dna fragment of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) from all known bacteria and sequenced the positive samples to identify the bacterial species. design: transabdominally  obtained amniotic fluid samples from 20 pregnant women with prelabour rupture of  the fetal membranes (prom), showing no signs of clinical infection, and 16 control samples were analysed with universal bacterial pcr. in addition, routine  bacterial culture and amniotic fluid glucose were studied. results: out of 20 prom patients, five were positive in the pcr. pcr detected ureaplasma urealyticum in two cases, haemophilus influenzae in one case, streptococcus oralis in one case and fusobacterium sp. in one case. only two of these were positive in a routine bacterial culture. both were multibacterial infections, which caused discrepancies between the pcr and culture results. two patients developed infectious complications: both were identified with the pcr assay. amniotic fluid glucose was lower in pcr positive patients compared with pcr negative patients. conclusion: bacterial 16s rdna pcr, in properly controlled conditions, promises to be a fast and reliable test for early intra-amniotic infection especially concerning ureaplasma urealyticum.
