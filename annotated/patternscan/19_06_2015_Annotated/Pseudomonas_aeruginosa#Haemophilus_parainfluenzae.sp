TI  == clinical characteristics of q fever and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia  in a tropical region of southern taiwan: a prospective observational study.
AB  == background: the clinical characteristics of q fever are poorly identified in the  tropics. fever with pneumonia or hepatitis are the dominant presentations of acute q fever, which exhibits geographic variability. in southern taiwan, which is located in a tropical region, the role of q fever in community-acquired pneumonia (cap) has never been investigated. methodology/principal findings: during the study period, may 2012 to april 2013, 166 cases of adult cap and 15 cases of acute q fever were prospectively investigated. cultures of clinical specimens, urine antigen tests for streptococcus pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila, and paired serologic assessments for mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae, and q fever (coxiella burnetii) were used for identifying pathogens associated with cap. from april 2004 to april 2013 (the pre-study period), 122 cases of acute q fever were also included retrospectively  for analysis. the geographic distribution of q fever and cap cases was similar. q fever cases were identified in warmer seasons and younger ages than cap. based on multivariate analysis, male gender, chills, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver  enzymes were independent characteristics associated with q fever. in patients with q fever, 95% and 13.5% of cases presented with hepatitis and pneumonia, respectively. twelve (7.2%) cases of cap were seropositive for c. burnetii antibodies, but none of them had acute q fever. among cap cases, 22.9% had a curb-65 score >==2, and 45.8% had identifiable pathogens. haemophilus parainfluenzae (14.5%), s. pneumoniae (6.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), and  klebsiella pneumoniae (3.0%) were the most common pathogens identified by cultures or urine antigen tests. moreover, m. pneumoniae, c. pneumoniae, and co-infection with 2 pathogens accounted for 9.0%, 7.8%, and 1.8%, respectively. conclusions: in southern taiwan, q fever is an endemic disease with hepatitis as  the major presentation and is not a common etiology of cap.

TI  == ocular surface infections in northeastern state of malaysia: a 10-year review of  bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == objective: ocular surface infections that include infections of conjunctiva, adnexa, and cornea have the potential risk of causing blindness within a given population. empirical antibiotic therapy is usually initiated based on epidemiological data of common causative agents. thus, the aims of this study were to determine the bacterial agents and their susceptibility patterns of isolates from ocular surface specimens in our hospital. methods: this is a retrospective analysis and records of bacterial isolates from ocular surface specimens in hospital universiti sains malaysia from january 2001 to december 2010 were examined. specimens were processed according to standard laboratory procedures. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted based on clinical  and laboratory standards institute recommendations. only single, nonrepetitive isolates were included in the analysis. results: a total of 1,267 isolates were obtained during the study period, which comprised staphylococcus aureus (n = 299, 23.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 194, 15.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 108, 8.5%), haemophilus influenzae (n = 100, 7.9%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 84, 6.6%), and enterobacter spp. (n = 81, 6.4%). fungi contributed to 4.4% of the total isolates. the antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that gram-positive bacteria were generally resistant to gentamicin (19%-57%), whereas  gram-negative bacteria were resistant to chloramphenicol (27%-58%). conclusions:  based on the above results, knowledge of the initial gram stain findings is imperative before the commencement of empirical antibiotic therapy. therefore, a  simple gram staining for all eye specimens is highly recommended.

TI  == induced sputum compared to bronchoalveolar lavage in young, non-expectorating cystic fibrosis children.
AB  == background: induced sputum (is) is feasible and safe in young cf children and is  a readily accessible, non-invasive technique. however, it has not been compared to bronchoalveolar lavage (bal), the gold standard for diagnosing lower airway infection. methods: we compared bacterial yield from is and bal in 11 non-expectorating cf children, aged 3 to 7.4 years. is samples were obtained in 10/11 cases. results: eight out of ten had the same predominant bacteria cultured from is and bal: pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia[1], staphylococcus aureus[3], and upper respiratory tract flora [4]. in one, serratia marcescens and haemophilus parainfluenzae were cultured from is alone, whereas in one, non-group b haemophilus influenzae was cultured from bal alone. conclusions: as proof of principle, is samples showed good bacteriologic correlation with bal. larger studies are recommended to confirm is as a clinically valuable tool and measure for early intervention studies in young cf children.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

TI  == [the role of macrolides in treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  == exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) cause a lot of hospital admissions, mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of  life. approximately half of copd exacerbations are associated with bacterial infections and many patients have lower airways colonization. current guidelines  recommend antibotic therapy in course of copd exacerbation for patients with sputum purulence and suggest correlation between severity of symptoms and the type of infecting pathogen. the most common bacterial pathogens isolated in copd  exacerbation are haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. the presence of these bacteria are more common for mild and moderate exacerbations. more virulent organisms such as staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in more severe cases. atypical pathogens such chlamydophila and mycoplasma could cause exacerbation alone or they could coexist with typical pathogen. rules of antibiotic therapy and usefulness of macrolides in treatment of copd exacerbation has been described in the article.

TI  == variability and effects of bronchial colonisation in patients with moderate copd.
AB  == sputum and lung function were periodically assessed in stable moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) outpatients to determine relationships between bronchial colonisation and inflammation. relationships between potentially pathogenic microorganism (ppm) typology, bronchial inflammation (neutrophilia, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8,  il-10 and il-12) and post-bronchodilator decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev(1)) were analysed. ppms periodically showing the same molecular profile using pulse field gel electrophoresis were considered long-term persistent. bronchial colonisation was observed in 56 out of 79 follow-up examinations (70.9%) and was mainly due to haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and  enterobacteria (n = 47). these ppms were all related to sputum neutrophilia (p< or =0.05, chi-squared test), and h. influenzae was related to higher levels of il-1beta (p = 0.005) and il-12 (p = 0.01), with a dose-response relationship (spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.38 for il-1beta (p = 0.001), and of 0.32 for il-12 (p = 0.006)). haemophilus parainfluenzae was not associated with an identifiable inflammatory response. long-term persistence of the same strain was  observed in 12 examinations (21.4%), mainly due to p. aeruginosa or enterobacteria. a neutrophilic bronchial inflammatory response was associated with a statistically significant decline in fev(1) during follow-up (or 2.67, 95% ci 1.07-6.62). a load-related relationship to bronchial inflammation in moderate  copd was observed for colonisation by h. influenzae, but not for colonisation by  h. parainfluenzae.

TI  == [infection pathogen analysis of 2388 patients in an open hematology ward from 1993 to 2004].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence of infection and pathogens in hematology  ward. methods: the data of incidence, pathogen, and outcome of infection of 2388  hospitalized patients in an open hematology ward of peking union medical college  hospital from 1993 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. results: the overall incidence of infection was 34.3% according to the person-times of hospitalization, 24.4% for nosocomial infection and 9.9% for community-acquired infection. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infection were gram  negative. the most common bacteria in the sputum samples included enterobacter (27%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%) and coagulase negative staphylococcus (mrscon, 12%), the most common bacteria in the blood samples included escherichia coli (43%), enterobacter cloacae (11%), and klebsiella (11%). whereas in the community-acquired infection the most common bacteria in the sputum samples were  haemophilus parainfluenzae (15%), mrscon (28%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and the most common bacteria in the blood samples were mrscon (28%), e. coli (28%), and klebsiella (9.4%). fungi were more often found in nosocomial infection, especially in the sputum samples. 12-year follow up showed that in nosocomial infection pseudomonas aeruginosa remained the most common bacteria in  the sputum samples, whereas e. coli and enterobacter cloacae became the major bacteria in the blood samples. in community-acquired infection, the proportion of staphylococcus aureus, that of klebsiella in blood samples, and that of e. coli in throat swab samples increased in recent years. the incidence of fungi infection had increased in both nosocomial infection and community acquired infection. the mortality of nosocomial infection was 6.1%, higher than that of the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant (p = 0.17). there was a trend of decrease in the mortality of community-acquired infection but did not in the nosocomial infection. conclusion: the patients in hematology ward are susceptible to infection, especially nosocomial infection that has a higher mortality rate in comparison with the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant. the pathogens of nosocomial infection are most likely g- bacteria, fungi and other bacteria resistant to most antibiotics. the mortality rate of nosocomial infection remains almost unchanged  in the 12-year follow up.

TI  == treatment of acute exacerbation of severe-to-very severe copd with azithromycin in patients vaccinated against streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == sixty-five consecutive eligible adult patients, who were treated as outpatients for stable severe-to-very severe copd, were enrolled in the study. all of them received 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine intramuscularly.  patients were seen monthly, as well as whenever they had symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation, at our outpatient clinic. eighteen out of 65 patients suffered from acute exacerbation (aecopd). three of these patients presented two episodes  of aecopd. patients with an acute exacerbation of copd received azithromycin 500  mg/day once daily for 3 days and a short course of oral prednisolone 25 mg/die. in 16 cases, a single species was isolated, while in the remaining 5 cases at least two species were recovered. clinical cure or improvement at the end of therapy (3-5 days post-therapy) was reported in 17 episodes of aecopd with no relapse at the late post-therapy (10-14 days after the completion of treatment).  bacteriologic eradication or presumptive eradication rates at the end of therapy  were 86% (24 out of 28 isolates). azithromycin eradicated all isolates of haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, h. parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella spp. isolated at baseline. eradication of sta aureus occurred in 1 of 3 isolates whereas azithromycin was unable to eradicate pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. our data seem to indicate that pneumococcal vaccination reduces the possibility that an aecopd is caused by streptococcus pneumoniae. this finding allows the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which, otherwise, should be avoided because of resistances.

TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == relationship between bacterial colonisation and the frequency, character, and severity of copd exacerbations.
AB  == background: patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) are prone  to frequent exacerbations which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. stable copd patients often have lower airway bacterial colonisation which may be an important stimulus to airway inflammation and thereby modulate exacerbation frequency. methods: twenty nine patients with copd (21 men, 16 current smokers) of mean (sd) age 65.9 (7.84) years, forced expiratory volume in  1 second (fev(1)) 1.06 (0.41) l, fev(1) % predicted 38.7 (15.2)%, fev(1)/fvc 43.7 (14.1)%, inhaled steroid dosage 1.20 (0.66) mg/day completed daily diary cards for symptoms and peak flow over 18 months. exacerbation frequency rates were determined from diary card data. induced sputum was obtained from patients in the stable state, quantitative bacterial culture was performed, and cytokine levels were measured. results: fifteen of the 29 patients (51.7%) were colonised by a possible pathogen: haemophilus influenzae (53.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (33.3%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (20%), branhamella catarrhalis (20%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). the presence of lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state was related to exacerbation frequency (p=0.023). patients colonised by h influenzae in the stable state reported more symptoms and increased sputum purulence at exacerbation than those not colonised. the median (iqr) symptom count at exacerbation in those colonised by h influenzae was 2.00 (2.00-2.65) compared with 2.00 (1.00-2.00) in those not colonised (p=0.03). the occurrence of increased sputum purulence at exacerbation per patient was 0.92 (0.56-1.00) in those colonised with h influenzae and 0.33 (0.00-0.60) in those not colonised (p=0.02). sputum interleukin (il)-8 levels correlated with the total bacterial count (rho=0.459, p=0.02). conclusion: lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state modulates the character and frequency of copd exacerbations.

TI  == oral bacteria influenced by the functional status of the elderly people and the type and quality of facilities for the bedridden.
AB  == aims: to analyse the relationship between oral bacteria and the health and functional status of the elderly. methods and results: the bacteria species in the oral cavity of the elderly were examined. it was found that the bedridden subjects staying at two hospitals for long-term (hobr) showed significantly lower detection rates of commensal bacteria species and significantly higher detection  rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and of coagulase(-) staph. aureus than those living independently (the independent). in addition, the detection rate of haemophilus parainfluenzae in nubr was discovered to be higher than that found in the independent. in hobr, the detection rate of ps. aeruginosa was significantly higher among in-patients who required continual care than those in need of partial care, while the detection rate of mrsa was significantly higher among in-patients with low serum albumin than those with normal serum albumin. conclusions: oral bacteria examination analysis proved that the risks of infection of some pathogenic bacteria species were correlated with functional status, physical function and nutritional state.  significance and impact of the study: our study suggests that the oral bacteria,  especially pathogenic bacteria were influenced by the functional status of the elderly and the type and quality of the facilities for the bedridden, physical function and nutritional state.

TI  == cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative  pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does  not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg  twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == absence of bacterial colonization of the airways after therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy without stenting.
AB  == following airway stenting, bacterial colonization of the airways with potentially pathogenic micro-organisms occurs within 4 weeks after treatment in the majority  of patients. the objective of this study was to prospectively investigate whether nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy (using laser, cryotherapy, mechanical  dilatation or debridement) is followed by airway colonization or infection. protected specimen brush sampling of the central airways and quantitative culture were performed immediately prior to, and 4 weeks after nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy in 20 consecutive patients with central airway lesions. prior  to therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in nine of 20 (45%) patients. in these nine patients, 10 different potential pathogens were  identified: streptococcus pneumoniae (four cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (three), haemophilus influenzae (two), and serratia marcescens (one). eight of these nine patients had a history of postobstructive infections, of which three were currently being treated with antibiotics. four weeks following therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in five of 20 (25%) patients, each of whom had airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy. in three of these five patients, the same organisms were found 4 weeks after bronchoscopy as at baseline bronchoscopy. in two of five patients new organisms were identified: one case of streptococcus viridans and one case of haemophilus parainfluenzae, both considered to be nonpathogens. in four of nine patients with airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy, the airways were clear of micro-organisms after the procedure. the authors conclude that: 1) nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy is not complicated by airway colonization or infection by new potential pathogens; and 2) therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy led to clearing of airway colonization/infection in almost half of the patients studied.

TI  == synthesis of immunoglobulins against haemophilus parainfluenzae by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with iga nephropathy.
AB  == background: we previously demonstrated glomerular deposition of haemophilus parainfluenzae (hp) antigens and the presence of iga antibody against hp antigens in patients with iga nephropathy (igan). in this report we examine the synthesis  of immunoglobulins against hp antigens in tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with igan. methods: we used tonsillar lymphocytes isolated from the palatine tonsils of 15 patients with igan and 16 patients with chronic tonsillitis but without renal disease. we examined lymphocyte proliferation and production of iga, igg, and igm antibodies against hp antigens by measuring thymidine uptake and concentrations of these antibodies in culture supernatants after lymphocyte incubation with hp antigens by elisa. results: lymphocytes from patients with igan showed a significantly higher stimulation index (si) on exposure to hp antigens (thymidine incorporation in tonsillar lymphocytes exposed to hp (c.p.m.)/ thymidine incorporation in unstimulated tonsillar lymphocytes (c.p.m.)) than did controls (p=0. 0015). lymphocytes from patients with igan also showed a  significantly higher iga si (concentrations of iga against hp antigens in supernatants from hp-stimulated lymphocytes/iga against hp antigens in supernatants from unstimulated tonsillar lymphocytes) than did controls (p=0.0004). we found positive correlations between concentrations of iga and igg  antibodies, between iga and igm antibodies, and between igg and igm antibodies against hp antigens after hp stimulation. conclusions: our results suggest that hp antigens stimulate tonsillar t and b lymphocytes in patients with igan and that these patients have polyclonal activation of lymphocytes against hp antigens, with isotype switching of antibody production from igm to iga.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. mics of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. the activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (mic50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/l) than previously reported for ofloxacin. as seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and  pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (mic 1-8 mg/l). mics for pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/l. levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; mic 0.06-0.25 mg/l), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; mic 1-32 mg/l). haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (mics 0.016-0.03 mg/l, 0.03-0.12 mg/l) and 0.03-0.12 mg/l, respectively). clostridium perfringens (n = 23; mic 0.25-1 mg/l) was more susceptible than bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; mic 0.5-4 mg/l). levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci (n = 107; mic 0.03-0.5 mg/l); the resistant strains (mics 2-32 mg/l) were usually also resistant to methicillin. levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; mic 1-32 mg/l), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (mics 0.5-2 mg/l). according to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for mics of 1, 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. in conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin  compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.

AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == efficacy and safety of high dose intravenous ciprofloxacin in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia. italian ciprofloxacin study group.
AB  == one hundred and fifty three hospitalized patients were enrolled in an open, prospective, multi-center study on the efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin (400 mg i.v., b.i.d.) for acute bacterial pneumonia: 93 (63%) patients were valid for efficacy out of 148 valid for intention-to-treat analysis. the most commonly isolated organisms from 93 valid-for-efficacy patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae (17%), streptococcus aureus (14%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11%). cure was achieved in 89/93 (95.7%) valid-for-efficacy patients; effective  eradications were obtained in 42 (45%) and presumed eradications in 48 (52%) of the 93 patients. mild or moderate adverse events (ae) occurred in 13/153 (8.5%) patients assessable for safety; all but one ae were rapidly reversible and only one treatment-stop (0.65%) was decided. the treatment of acute bacterial pneumonias with high-dose parenteral ciprofloxacin appears to be efficacious and  well tolerated.

TI  == etiology, susceptibility, and treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of complicated chronic bronchitis in the primary care setting: ciprofloxacin 750 mg  b.i.d. versus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. bronchitis study group.
AB  == although controversial, antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb) appears beneficial in patients with a  history of repeated infections, those who have comorbid illnesses, and those with marked airway obstruction. in a community-based, open, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin (cip) 750 mg and clarithromycin (cla) 500 mg, each given twice daily for 10 days, were compared in 2180 patients with aecb  (1083 cip, 1097 cla). patients were >40 years of age and had complicated/severe aecb episodes defined as at least three episodes within the past year, at least three comorbid conditions, previous failed antibiotic treatment for aecb within the previous 2 to 4 weeks, or community susceptibility data indicating a high number of resistant pathogens. significant bacterial isolates (>10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter) from homogenized sputa were identified. susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials was determined by the microbroth dilution technique. the majority of patients were white (83%) and were current or previous smokers (81%). mean patient age was 62 years. a history of at least three aecb episodes in the previous year was reported by 54% of cip-treated patients and 53% of cla-treated patients. of 777 primary isolates positively identified and cultured from 673 patients, the bacterial pathogens isolated and their incidence included haemophilus species, 28%; moraxella catarrhalis, 18%; enterobacteriaceae, 18%; staphylococcus aureus, 17%; streptococcus pneumoniae, 7%; and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4%. beta-lactamase production was found in 38% of haemophilus influenzae, 10% of haemophilus parainfluenzae, and 85% of m catarrhalis isolates. thirty-four percent of s pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration > or =0.12 mg/l). among the 673 patients who were valid for clinical assessment and had a pretherapy pathogen isolated, clinical success and overall bacteriologic eradication rates at the end of therapy were 93% and 98% for cip versus 90% and 96% for cla. the differences between cip and cla did not reach statistical significance. superinfections were  reported significantly more frequently in cla-treated (3%) versus cip-treated patients (1%). eradication rates for specific organisms for cip and cla, respectively, were haemophilus species, 99% and 93%; m catarrhalis, 99% and 100%; s pneumoniae, 91% and 92%; and enterobacteriaceae, 100% and 95%. drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% of cip-treated patients and 10% of cla-treated patients. cip 750 mg b.i.d. had a higher (but not statistically significant) clinical and bacteriologic cure rate than cla 500 mg b.i.d. in the treatment of patients with bacteriologically proven complicated/severe aecb. the causative bacterial pathogens of aecb appear to be evolving, with a predominance of gram-negative and other resistant organisms observed. thus antibiotic therapy for at-risk patients with aecb should include agents that have activity against gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == optimum use of selective plated media in primary processing of respiratory tract  specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == a total of 258 respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis were inoculated onto nine different plated media, and the rates of recovery of potential pathogens were compared. media included sheep blood agar, enriched chocolate agar, macconkey agar for gram-negative bacilli, chocolate agar containing bacitracin for haemophilus spp., bromcresol green agar for yeasts, cetrimide agar for pseudomonas spp., sheep blood agar containing colistin and nalidixic acid for gram-positive cocci, mannitol salt agar for staphylococcus aureus, and oxidation-fermentation agar containing 300 u of polymyxin b per ml and 2 u of bacitracin per ml (of-pbl medium) for pseudomonas cepacia. with two exceptions, all of these media proved useful in recovering potential pathogens from respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis. the two exceptions were cetrimide agar and colistin-nalidixic acid-supplemented sheep blood agar, which were found to be superfluous. in addition, the results of this  study further delineated the prevalence of selected bacteria and fungi in respiratory tract secretions from patients with cystic fibrosis. in rank order of frequency of isolation, we recovered isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, candida albicans, s. aureus, haemophilus influenzae,  molds, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, yeasts other than candida albicans, miscellaneous gram-negative bacilli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, p. cepacia, and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == [a study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  == panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) is a combination drug of papm, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and bp, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1.  its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. it was superior to imipenem (ipm) in the in  vitro antibacterial activities against haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus including mrsa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. papm had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of ipm against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of ipm. the clinical usefulness of papm/bp was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. in terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of p. aeruginosa remained unchanged. six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. side-effects  were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of s-got and s-gpt were found in 1 case. in conclusion, papm/bp is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, l-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  == the attainable inhibitory ratios (ar) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amx/ca), ofloxacin (ofl), l-ofloxacin (l-ofl), cefuroxime (cefu), ciprofloxacin (cip), and enoxacin (eno), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. ar of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the mics achieved at the respiratory  site. bacteria tested included staphylococcus aureus, group-a and group-b streptococci, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, brahamella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae,  h. parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella pneumophila. the antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against gram-positive cocci. ofloxacin and l-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ars against respiratory pathogen, including,  l. pneumophila, h. influenzae, and b. catarrhalis. all agents showed no, or inadequately low ars for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == histidine decarboxylases from bacteria that colonise the human respiratory tract.
AB  == we investigated whether production of histamine by bacteria isolated from sputum  of patients with infective lung diseases could be attributed to the presence of histidine decarboxylase (hd). twenty gram-positive and 20 gram-negative organisms were studied for their ability to decarboxylate 14c-histidine in vitro over the ph range 4.5-7.5. of the bacteria investigated, lysates from the gram-negative species haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa liberated 14co2 and histamine from 14c-histidine in the presence of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate. in contrast, results obtained in the absence of cofactor were similar to those of negative (lysate-free) controls suggesting that the hd enzymes of these species resembled  those previously described in other gram-negative bacteria. no hd activity was detected over this ph range in lysates from gram-positive species. this finding correlated with earlier observations that these gram-positive organisms did not produce histamine in vitro.

TI  == pulmonary diseases in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in  zimbabwe, central africa.
AB  == during the 11 month period up to 30 september 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. hiv was heterosexually transmitted. predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were  contaminated. pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. endobronchial kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. bacterial pathogens isolated included  staph. aureus (5), s. pneumoniae (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), haemophilus influenzae (2), h. parainfluenzae (1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). invading aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. no diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. it is concluded that in central africa pulmonary complications in aids patients are similar to those in europe and north america but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. m. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. this study  has confirmed that p. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.

TI  == histamine synthesis by respiratory tract micro-organisms: possible role in pathogenicity.
AB  == five bacterial species considered to be potential pathogens in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia--branhamella  catarrhalis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae--were evaluated for their potential to synthesise histamine in vitro. bacterial species commonly isolated from infected  sputum but generally not considered to be pathogenic--enterobacteriacae, neisseria pharyngis, coagulase negative staphylococci, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, and candida albicans--were similarly studied. of the "pathogens", the gram negative species b catarrhalis, h parainfluenzae and ps aeruginosa synthesised clinically important amounts of histamine; this was not the case for  the gram positive species s aureus and s pneumoniae. of the "non-pathogenic" species, only the enterobacteriacae, as a group, were found to synthesise clinically important amounts of histamine. these results show that some gram negative bacteria, associated with acute exacerbations in respiratory infections, produce histamine and possibly other inflammatory mediators, which may contribute to their pathogenecity in the lower respiratory tract in vivo.

TI  == the epidemiology of respiratory tract pathogens in southern netherlands.
AB  == results of sputum cultures and susceptibility tests have been reviewed for the years 1977-1986, with approximately 1,700 positive cultures per year. haemophilus influenzae always occupied the first place, being grown in 65% of positive specimens in 1977 and 37% in 1986. streptococcus pneumoniae occupied the second place, rising from 17 to 27% in the same period, during which branhamella catarrhalis rose from 5 to 26%. based on the frequency of occurrence of individual bacterial species in the sputum cultures and on the percentage of strains resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and ofloxacin, theoretical chances of failure of blind therapy were calculated and found to be most advantageous for ofloxacin and cotrimoxazole. no explanation could be given for the increase in beta-lactamase production by b. catarrhalis, but the disappearance of haemophilus parainfluenzae may have been due to improvements in the identification procedure.

AB  == a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative, 6059-s, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. twenty-five patients were treated with 10 to 274 mg/kg per day of 6059-s by intravenous administrations. the diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (2), pneumonia (4), pertussis (4), acute enterocolitis (2), recurrent urinary tract infection (2), suspected septicemia (3), and acute purulent meningitis (1); and the remaining 5  patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. the pathogens recovered were streptococcus pneumoniae (1), haemophilus influenzae (4), haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), enterobacter aerogenes (1), proteus morganii (1), psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and salmonella typhimurium (1). all the  patients of bacterial infections were cured after the 6059-s therapy. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium were not eradicated after the 6059-s therapy, and the rate of bacterial disappearance was 75%. diarrhea (3), precordial pain (2, only in cases with high-dose therapy), transient elevation of got and gpt (2), and transient eosinophilia (2) were found to be associated with  the 6059-s therapy. however, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. half life of the serum 6059-s level was 1.34 +/- 0.16 hours. csf concentrations in a case with haemophilus influenzae meningitis ranged 4.0 to 9.7 mcg/ml after an intravenous injection of 34.3 to 75 mg/kg of 6059-s. from the present study, 6059-s appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections. it remains to be further determined whether 6059-s is superior to abpc in the treatment of haemophilus influenzae meningitis.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

TI  == transfer of a plasmid-specified beta-lactamase gene from haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == a number of ampicillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae could donate a gene specifying the type iiia (tem) beta-lactamase to haemophilus parainfluenzae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. donor strains rapidly lost their ability to transfer ampicillin resistance on storage or subculture. such strains  also apparently contained a single species of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of contour length 1.2 mum, equivalent to about 2.5 x 10(6)  daltons. no species of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid large enough to encode sex factor activity was detected. despite this, transfer occurred to several bacterial genera in the presence of deoxyribonuclease, suggesting that transmissibility was by conjugation. the beta-lactamase gene was generally unstable after transfer and was lost in the absence of selection. where stable transcipients were found, this was evidently by insertion of the beta-lactamase gene into the host chromosome. in p. aeruginosa insertion was always accompanied  by induction of auxotrophy for adenine, suggesting insertion at a specific site.  it is believed that insertion also occurred at one site on the chromosome of escherichia coli. crypticity measurements for beta-lactamase activity showed that there was little or no penetration barrier to beta-lactam drugs in haemophilus. this may explain the long delay in the acquisition of ampicillin resistance by this organism.

TI  == [gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  == we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing  with other antibiotics. beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci  are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. staph, aureus and staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin,  and no resistant strain to this drug was found. haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e. coli, citrobacerr, serratia, pr. morganii and pr. rettgeri. pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus. antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. gentamicin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
