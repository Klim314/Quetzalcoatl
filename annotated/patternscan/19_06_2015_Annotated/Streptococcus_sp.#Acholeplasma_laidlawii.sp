TI  == dose-dependent activation of microglial cells by toll-like receptor agonists alone and in combination.
AB  == microglial cells express toll-like receptors (tlrs) recognising exogenous and endogenous ligands. upon stimulation with agonists of tlr2, tlr4, and tlr9, nitric oxide (no) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) were released by primary mouse microglial cell cultures. endotoxin was most potent in stimulating  microglia followed by pneumolysin, cytosine-guanosine (cpg) oligodesoxynucleotide (odn), and tripalmitoyl-s-glyceryl-cysteine. maximum stimulation of tlr2, tlr4, and tlr9 resulted in approximately equal amounts of nitric oxide release. pneumolysin was a potent activator of microglial cells; at high concentrations, it reduced cell viability. no cytotoxicity was noted with the other tlr agonists. costimulation with maximum concentrations of two tlr agonists did not further increase nitric oxide release. costimulation with submaximum concentrations was additive or supraadditive, suggesting that even low concentrations of products of infectious agents can lead to microglial activation via tlrs.

TI  == structural features of glycosyltransferases synthesizing major bilayer and nonbilayer-prone membrane lipids in acholeplasma laidlawii and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == in membranes of acholeplasma laidlawii two consecutively acting glucosyltransferases, the (i) alpha-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (mglcdag) synthase (almgs) (ec ) and the (ii) alpha-diglucosyl-dag (dglcdag) synthase (aldgs) (ec ), are involved in maintaining (i) a certain anionic lipid surface charge density and (ii) constant nonbilayer/bilayer conditions (curvature packing stress), respectively. cloning of the aldgs gene revealed related uncharacterized sequence analogs especially in several gram-positive pathogens, thermophiles and archaea,  where the encoded enzyme function of a potential streptococcus pneumoniae dgs gene (cpoa) was verified. a strong stimulation of aldgs by phosphatidylglycerol (pg), cardiolipin, or nonbilayer-prone 1,3-dag was observed, while only pg stimulated cpoa. several secondary structure prediction and fold recognition methods were used together with swiss-model to build three-dimensional model structures for three mgs and two dgs lipid glycosyltransferases. two escherichia  coli proteins with known structures were identified as the best templates, the membrane surface-associated two-domain glycosyltransferase murg and the soluble glcnac epimerase. differences in electrostatic surface potential between the different models and their individual domains suggest that electrostatic interactions play a role for the association to membranes. further support for this was obtained when hybrids of the n- and c-domain, and full size almgs with green fluorescent protein were localized to different regions of the e. coli inner membrane and cytoplasm in vivo. in conclusion, it is proposed that the varying abilities to bind, and sense lipid charge and curvature stress, are governed by typical differences in charge (pi values), amphiphilicity, and hydrophobicity for the n- and (catalytic) c-domains of these structurally similar membrane-associated enzymes.

TI  == sequence properties of the 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase from acholeplasma laidlawii membranes. recognition of a large group of lipid glycosyltransferases in eubacteria and archaea.
AB  == synthesis of the nonbilayer-prone alpha-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (mglcdag) is crucial for bilayer packing properties and the lipid surface charge density in the membrane of acholeplasma laidlawii. the gene for the responsible, membrane-bound glucosyltransferase (almgs) (ec ) was sequenced and functionally cloned in escherichia coli, yielding mglcdag in the recombinants. similar amino acid sequences were encoded in the genomes of several gram-positive bacteria (especially pathogens), thermophiles, archaea, and a few eukaryotes. all of these contained the typical ex(7)e catalytic motif of the cazy family 4 of alpha-glycosyltransferases. the synthesis of mglcdag by a close sequence analog from streptococcus pneumoniae (spmgs) was verified by polymerase chain reaction cloning, corroborating a connection between sequence and functional similarity for these proteins. however, almgs and spmgs varied in dependence on anionic phospholipid activators phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, suggesting certain  regulatory differences. fold predictions strongly indicated a similarity for almgs (and spmgs) with the two-domain structure of the e. coli murg cell envelope glycosyltransferase and several amphipathic membrane-binding segments in various  proteins. on the basis of this structure, the almgs sequence charge distribution, and anionic phospholipid dependence, a model for the bilayer surface binding and  activity is proposed for this regulatory enzyme.

TI  == bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein inhibits growth of a strain of acholeplasma laidlawii and l forms of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) inhibited growth of cell wall-deficient acholeplasma laidlawii and l forms of certain strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. however, the same strains of s. aureus and s. pyogenes with intact cell walls were not susceptible to the growth-inhibitory effects of bpi.

TI  == [the phenotypic traits of mollicutes as their possible phylogenetic markers].
AB  == interaction of cells of mollicutes acholeplasma laidlawii pg 8, a. laidlawii var. granulum 18, mycoplasma hominis pg 21, m. pneumoniae fh, m. fermentans pg 118 and their extracellular products with different carbohydrates, plant lectins of different carbohydrate specificity with glycocalix carbohydrates of the same microorganisms has been studied. basing on this study and data from literature a  conclusion is made that such phenotypical characteristics as the ability to form  extracellular fructose-1.6-diphosphate specific lectin and n-acetylneuraminic acid as the end sugar in the composition of carbohydrates of mollicute glycocalyx can serve a phylogenetic marker. these markers indicate the possible origin of mollicutes from bacteria of the group bacillus-lactobacillus-streptococcus as a result of degenerative evolution and are their rather stable characteristics. such marker as extracellular lectin specific to fructoso-1.6-diphosphate which is formed by phytopathogenic mollicute a. laidlawii var. granulum, 118 evidences that in spite of genetic affinity of this "yellow" agent of cereals with a. laidlawii, it does not descend from the last ancestor directly, but they probably have some general ancestor. we do not know yet this ancestor which is a link in the evolution chain of acholeplasmas in the process of their origin from the mentioned group of bacteria. it is supposed that these markers together with such known phylogenetic markers as lactate dehydrogenase which is activated by fructoso-1.6-diphosphate, and aldolases and glycolipids with specific properties  can additionally evidence for the origin of mollicutes and their affinity to certain groups of microorganisms.

TI  == transformation of acholeplasma laidlawii with streptococcal plasmids pva868 and pva920.
AB  == one limitation with studying mycoplasma genetics is the lack of cloning vectors.  studies were undertaken to determine whether streptococcal plasmids could replicate in acholeplasma laidlawii, for the purpose of identifying potential vectors. plasmids pva868 and pva920 contain the same origin of replication and tetracycline resistance determinant. pva920 also contains an erythromycin resistance determinant not present in pva868. a. laidlawii was transformed with plasmids pva868 (13.7 kb) and pva920 (12.2 kb), and isolated from the transformants were deletion derivatives of the parent plasmids having sizes of 3.7 and 10.3 kb, respectively. the tetracycline and erythromycin resistance markers functioned in a. laidlawii, and the deletion derivatives may be useful for development of mycoplasma vectors. however, difficulties may arise due to plasmid instability.

TI  == origins of the mycoplasmas: sterol-nonrequiring mycoplasmas evolved from streptococci.
AB  == we report the establishment of a phylogenetic relationship between the sterol-nonrequiring mycoplasmas (acholeplasma species) and streptococci. three specific antisera prepared against purified streptococcus faecalis fructose diphosphate aldolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pediococcus cerevisiae glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used for comparative enzyme immunological studies; the ouchterlony double-diffusion technique and the  quantitative microcomplement fixation procedure were employed. the reactions obtained provide evidence showing that all seven acholeplasma species studied (a. laidlawii, a. granularum, a. modicum, a. oculi, a. axanthum. a. hippikon, and a.  equifetale) are phylogenetically related to streptococci and that they evolved from streptococci. the data strongly suggest that the acholeplasmas comprise a distinct evolutionary group that has diverged from streptococci belonging to lancefield group d or n. no reactions were observed between these enzyme antisera and cell extracts from six fermentative mycoplasma species. these results support the view that mycoplasmas are derived from various bacteria.

TI  == a novel method for the determination of electrical potentials across cellular membranes. ii. membrane potentials of acholeplasmas, mycoplasmas, streptococci and erythrocytes.
AB  == the membrane potentials of acholeplasma laidlawii, mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri, mycoplasma gallisepticum, streptococcus faecalis and human erythrocytes have been determined by applying a novel technique. the membrane potentials were  calculated simply from potassium concentrations determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy, and gravimetry. the versatility of the new technique is demonstrated by comparing our results with data obtained by different techniques.

TI  == acid-soluble nucleotides of acholeplasma (mycoplasma) laidlawii a.
AB  == a study was made of the acid-soluble nucleotides present in acholeplasma (mycoplasma) laidlawii a during growth. the nucleotide pool of this organism is meagre, both qualitatively and quantitatively. the main nucleotides are uridine mono- and diphosphates, and none of the more complex nucleotide compounds, such as uridine diphosphate (udp) sugars or sugar peptides, required for cell wall formation, were detected. the nucleotide composition of a. laidlawii a is compared with that of the streptococcus l-form.

TI  == [localization and possible development cycle of mycoplasmas and bacterial l-forms in cell cultures].
AB  == using vital stain chlorazol-black e the authors studied the localization and behaviour of 5 mycoplasma species and the stable l-form of beta-hemolytic streptococcus of group a in various continuous cell lines. mycoplasmas and l-forms had a definite evolution cycle in the cells. at first they are arranged extracellularly and on the surface of the cells, and then intracellularly where they multiply intensively; later they are again localized on the surface of the cells and extracellularly. this cycle proved to depend on the type of infection.  the character of the localization depended on the type of the causative agent and of the culture.
