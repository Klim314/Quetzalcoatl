TI  == [retrospective analysis of fusobacterium associated infections; experience at aomori prefectural hospital with 108 cases from 1995 to 1999].
AB  == we experienced 108 cases of fusobacterium associated infections, including otolaryngeal, oral, pleuropulmonary, intraabdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, at aomori prefectural hospital during the 5 year-period from 1995 to  1999. a total of 433 organisms, included 113 fusobacterium spp. (80 fusobacterium nucleatum, 18 fusobaterium necrophorum, 5 fusobacterium varium, 4 fusobacterium mortiferum, 6 fusobacterium spp.), were recovered with an average of 4.0 organisms per case of the 108 cases, 68% were mixed aerobic and anaerobic and yielded 185 anaerobic bacteria (2.5 per case) and 137 aerobic bacteria (1.9 per case) with an average of 4.4 per case. the remaining 32% were purely anaerobic and yielded 111 organisms with an average of 3.2 per case, prevotella spp., bacteroides fragilis group, streptococcus milleri group, enterobacteriaceae, peptostreptococcus spp. staphylococcus spp. were most frequently coisolated with  fusobacterium spp.

TI  == subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (go). age was inversely associated with the go. plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with go, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of go. the gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the go. statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of go were detected for propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium and selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species eubacterium alactolyticum, campylobacter concisus, c. gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, f. mortiferum, f. nucleatum, and f. varium from the more enlarged lesions (go >3).

TI  == endopeptidase activities of selected porphyromonas spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. of oral and non-oral origin.
AB  == the ability of three porphyromonas spp., seven prevotella spp., seven fusobacterium spp. and two related bacteroides spp. (b. levii and b. macacae) to  degrade an extensive range of synthetic endo-, amino- and diamino peptidase substrates linked to the fluorescent leaving group 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (nhmec) was investigated. many more species than was previously recognized exhibited peptidase activities, albeit at lower levels than those already described for porphyromonas gingivalis. detection of chymotrypsin-like activity was dependent on which of three nhmec-linked substrates was used, but all species exhibited degradative activity with at least one of these substrates. elastase-like activity was detected in all species though not all species reacted with each of the elastase substrates. glycylprolyl peptidase activity was detected in all of the species tested with the exception of f. mortiferum, f. gonidiaformans, f. naviforme and f. necrophorum. while the detection of peptidase activities does not appear to be useful for the differentiation of species within the genera bacteroides and prevotella, its ability to differentiate species of the genus porphyromonas or fusobacterium warrants further investigation.

TI  == effects of periodontopathic bacteria on il-1 and il-1 inhibitor production by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == the effect of heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria on the production of interleukin-1 (il-1) and an il-1 inhibitor by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn's) was examined. peripheral blood was obtained from 18 healthy volunteers and the pmn's were separated using dextran sedimentation and ficoll-paque density gradient centrifugation. the pmn's (5 x 10(5) cells/well) were cultured in serum-free media with or without heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria. four gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria were used; bacteroides gingivalis fdc 381, bacteroides forsythus fdc 338, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 and fusobacterium nucleatum fdc 263. the non-oral fusobacterium mortiferum atcc 25557 was used as a control organism. il-1 activity was assayed using thymocyte proliferation. the non-oral organism f. mortiferum stimulated il-1 production by  pmn's, in contrast none of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated il-1 release  although the bacteria themselves had an il-1 enhancing effect. following fractionation of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated pmn supernatants, an il-1 inhibitory fraction was identified. these results may illustrate a further mechanism by which periodontopathic bacteria may evade the protective effect of pmn's and may also suggest a regulatory role for pmn's in chronic inflammatory periodontal disease.

TI  == interleukin-1 and interleukin-1 inhibitor production by human adherent cells stimulated with periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study examined the effect of the putative periodontopathic bacteria bacteroides gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum on the production of interleukin-1 (il-1) and il-1 inhibitors by human plastic-adherent mononuclear cells from normal donors. fusobacterium mortiferum was used as a non-oral, non-pathogenic control organism. unstimulated adherent cells spontaneously secreted an il-1 inhibitor, whereas stimulation with b. gingivalis induced the synthesis and secretion of il-1. with both fusobacteria il-1 was present in the intracellular environment, whereas the predominant secretory product was either il-1 or an il-1 inhibitor. these results suggest that bacteria are capable of modulating cytokine production by monocytes and may thereby alter the local immune response.
