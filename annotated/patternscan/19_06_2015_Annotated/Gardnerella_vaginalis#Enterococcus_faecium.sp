TI  == adherence of bacteria to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract of heifers and cows.
AB  == in the present study, we examined the adherence of indigenous vaginal bacteria, probiotic strains, and metritis pathogens to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tracts of heifers and cows and compared their adherence with  the bacterial adherence to mucus collected from the stomach and large intestine of pigs. most of the vaginal strains adhered to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract and strongly adhered to gastric mucus, with the exception of lactobacillus buchneri 24s8. only lactobacillus mucosae 29s8, enterococcus faecium e21, and e. faecium eac adhered to colonic mucus. probiotic  strains adhered strongly to mucus collected from the reproductive tract and gastric mucus but did not adhere to colonic mucus. pathogenic strains were adherent to vaginal, uterine horn, and gastric mucus, except escherichia coli o8:k88ab:h9 (65), fusobacterium necrophorum, and gardnerella vaginalis, which adhered to uterine cervix mucus. only kocuria kristinae and g. vaginalis adhered  to uterine body mucus; e. coli o149:k88ac (ec) adhered to colonic mucus. the strains did not exhibit host specificity but rather strain specificity. the ability to adhere to mucus was a characteristic unique to each strain. to our knowledge, this is the first report regarding in vitro adherence of gras (generally regarded as safe) lactobacilli isolated from different sources to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem on clinical isolates from the united kingdom.
AB  == mics of meropenem were determined for a wide range of common bacteria of clinical importance. for enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, campylobacter coli/jejuni, beta-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes other than  clostridium difficile, mics were almost always within the range 0.002-0.5 mg/l. the activity of meropenem for these organisms was always greater than that of imipenem and piperacillin, and was similar to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime  except that strains resistant to these latter, and to piperacillin, were usually  sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. meropenem was also active against most non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l but pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia was often resistant, as it was to all the other drugs tested. staphylococci, strreptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-haemolytic streptococci were usually more sensitive to imipenem than to meropenem, but even methicillin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to both drugs (mics less than 4 mg/l). enterococci were also less sensitive to meropenem  than to imipenem, and enterococcus faecium was invariably highly resistant to all the drugs tested except ciprofloxacin, which had marginal activity. results for ps. maltophilia and haem. influenzae were affected by media used for sensitivity  testing.
