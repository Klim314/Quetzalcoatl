TI  - Infectious agents associated with diarrhoea in neonatal foals in central Kentucky: a comprehensive molecular study.
AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Diarrhoea caused by infectious agents is common in  foals but there is no comprehensive molecular work-up of the relative prevalence of common agents and appearance of coinfections. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of 9 infectious agents in gastrointestinal (GI)-diseased and healthy foals with ages ranging from 1 to 20 weeks of age and to what degree coinfections are associated with clinical signs of GI disease. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective controlled observational study. METHODS: The population consisted of 88 Thoroughbred foals aged 2 days to 17 weeks born on 32 different studfarms in Kentucky. Healthy (n = 37) and GI-diseased (n = 51) foals were identified based on clinical presentation. Faecal samples were analysed for 9 infectious agents by real-time PCR: equine rotavirus, equine coronavirus, Clostridium difficile toxins A & B, Neorickettsia risticii, Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin, Lawsonia intracellularis, Rhodococcus equi, Cryptosporidium spp., and Salmonella spp. Salmonella was also cultured from overnight selenite enrichment broth. RESULTS: The prevalence of infectious pathogens under study was between 0% (Lawsonia intracellularis) and 34.6% (equine rotavirus). The overall prevalence for any infectious agent was 63.2% in the GI-diseased group and 43.2% in the healthy group. Coinfections were significantly more frequent in the sick group (15 monoinfections vs. 22 coinfections) than in the healthy group (12 vs. 4, respectively, P = 0.0002). Six of the 8 infectious agents were associated with the GI-diseased group, the other 2 were not (equine coronavirus and R. equi). CONCLUSIONS: The use of panels rather than individual tests in combination with quantitative toxin gene analysis enables detection of coinfections significantly associated with risk of disease. Several infectious diseases previously not tested for or considered unimportant were found at high prevalence and require further investigation.
TI  - Chronic hepatitis, hepatic dysplasia, fibrosis, and biliary hyperplasia in hamsters naturally infected with a novel Helicobacter classified in the H. bilis cluster.
AB  - We recently described helicobacter-associated progressive, proliferative, and dysplastic typhlocolitis in aging (18- to 24-month-old) Syrian hamsters. Other pathogens associated with typhlocolitis in hamsters, Clostridium difficile, Lawsonia intracellularis, and Giardia spp., were not indentified. The presence of Helicobacter genus-specific DNA was noted by PCR in cecal and paraffin-embedded liver samples from aged hamsters by the use of Helicobacter-specific PCR primers. By 16S rRNA analysis, the Helicobacter sp. isolated from the liver tissue was identical to the cecal isolates from hamsters. The six hamster 16S rRNA sequences form a genotypic cluster most closely related to Helicobacter sp. Flexispira taxon 8, part of the Helicobacter bilis/H. cinaedi group. Livers from aged helicobacter-infected hamsters showed various stages of predominantly portocentric and, to a lesser extent, perivenular fibrosis. Within nodules, there was cellular atypia consistent with nodular dysplasia. The livers also exhibited a range of chronic active portal/interface and lobular inflammation, with significant portal hepatitis being present. The inflammation was composed of a mixture of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, indicative of its chronic-active nature in these aged hamsters infected with Helicobacter spp. The isolation of novel Helicobacter spp., their identification by PCR from the diseased livers of aged hamsters, and their taxonomic classification as belonging to the Helicobacter bilis cluster strengthen the argument that H. bilis and closely related Helicobacter spp. play an etiological role in hepatobiliary disease in both animals and humans.
TI  - Progressive proliferative and dysplastic typhlocolitis in aging syrian hamsters naturally infected with Helicobacter spp.: a spontaneous model of inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  - Helicobacter spp. have been implicated in a variety of gastrointestinal tract diseases, including peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in humans and animals. Although most models of IBD are experimentally induced, spontaneous or natural models of IBD are rare. Herein, we describe a long-term study of chronic, progressive lesions that develop in the distal portion of the large bowel of unmanipulated Syrian hamsters naturally infected with Helicobacter spp. Twenty-four Syrian hamsters of three age groups (group A, 1 month [n = 4], group B, 7-12 months [n = 12], group C, 18-24 months [n = 12]), underwent complete postmortem examination. Results of microbial isolation and polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses confirmed the presence of Helicobacter spp. infection in the distal portion of the large bowel of all animals. Additionally, confounding pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile, Lawsonia intracellularis, and Giardia spp. that can cause proliferative enteritis, were absent in the hamsters of this study. Histopathologic scores for inflammation (P < 0.01), hyperplasia (P < 0.01), and dysplasia (P < 0.05) were significantly higher in the ileocecocolic (ICC) junction of animals in group C, relative to group A. Dysplastic lesions of various grades were detected in 5 of 11 hamsters in group C. Interestingly, the segment of the bowel that is usually colonized by Helicobacter spp. in hamsters had the most severe lesions. One hamster of group C developed a malignant fibrous histiocytoma, whereas another hamster developed a round cell sarcoma originating from the ICC junction. Thus, lesions in the distal portion of the large bowel of aging hamsters naturally colonized with Helicobacter spp. warrants developing the hamster as an animal model of IBD and potentially IBD-related cancer.
