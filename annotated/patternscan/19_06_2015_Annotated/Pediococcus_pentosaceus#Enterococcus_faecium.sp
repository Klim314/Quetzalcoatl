TI  == characterization, identification and application of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  == there has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. this study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in china. one hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be lab based on their gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. these isolates were divided into eight groups (a-h) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. the group a to h strains were identified as lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), l. casei (5.1%), leuconostoc (ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus (24.2%), enterococcus (e.) mundtii (12.1%), lactococcus (lc.) garvieae (15.2%), e. faecium (9.1%) and lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16s rrna and reca genes. p. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the lab population in  the paddy rice silage. a selected strain, namely l. casei r 465, was found to be  able to grow under low ph conditions and to improve the silage quality with low ph and a relatively high content of lactic acid. this study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant lab species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with lab, and that strain r 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.

TI  == isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. from faeces of the blue-fronted amazon parrot in brazil.
AB  == in brazil, the blue-fronted amazon parrot (amazona aestiva) is a common pet. the  faecal microbiota of these birds include a wide variety of bacterial species, the majority of which belong to the gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (lab) clade. the aim of this study was to investigate differences in the diversity and abundance of lab and bifidobacterium spp. in the cloacae between wild and captive birds and to select, identify and characterise lab for consideration as a parrot  probiotic. cloacal swabs were collected from 26 wild and 26 captive birds. bacterial dna was extracted, and the 16s rrna genes were amplified. the numbers of pcr-positive enterococcus, pediococcus, and lactobacillus species isolated from wild and captive birds were significantly different (p<0.05). enterococcus was the most frequently isolated genus, followed by pediococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus and bifidobacterium. enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most frequently isolated species from all birds. this study increases our understanding of the faecal microbiota, and may help to improve the nutrition and habitat management of captive and wild parrots. the bacterial population identified in the faecal microbiota of clinically healthy wild and captive parrots can serve as a database to analyse variations in the gut microbiota of pathogen-infected parrots and to develop probiotics specific to these genera.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of nisin, pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 against l. monocytogenes, e. faecium and e. faecalis and bacteriocin cross resistance and antibiotic susceptibility of their bacteriocin resistant variants.
AB  == the bacteriocin susceptibility of listeria monocytogenes mtcc 657, enterococcus faecium dsmz 20477, e. faecium vre, and e. faecalis atcc 29212 and their corresponding bacteriocin resistant variants was assessed. the single and combined effect of nisin and pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 bacteriocins produced by pediococcus pentosaceus 34, and e. faecium fh99, respectively, was determined. pediocin34 proved to be more effective in inhibiting l. monocytogenes mtcc 657. a greater antibacterial effect was observed against e. faecium dsmz 20477 and e. faecium (vre) when the a combination of nisin, pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 were used whereas in case of l. monocytogenes mtcc 657 a combination of pediocin  34 and enterocin fh99 was more effective in reducing the survival of pathogen. bacteriocin cross-resistance and the antibiotic susceptibility of wild type and their corresponding resistant variants were assessed and results showed that resistance to a bacteriocin may extend to other bacteriocins within the same class and also the acquired resistance to bacteriocins can modify the antibiotic  susceptibility/resistance profile of the bacterial species used in the study. according to the hydrophobicity nisin resistant variant of l. monocytogenes was more hydrophobic (p < 0.001), whereas the pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 resistant variants were less hydrophobic than the wild type strain. nisin, pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 resistant variants of e. faecium dsmz 20477 and e. faecium vre were less hydrophobic than their wild type counterparts. nisin resistant e. faecalis atcc 29212 was less hydrophobic than its wild type counterpart.

TI  == effects of 8 chemical and bacterial additives on the quality of corn silage.
AB  == this project aimed to evaluate the effects 8 additives on the fermentation, dry matter (dm) losses, nutritive value, and aerobic stability of corn silage. corn forage harvested at 31% dm was chopped (10mm) and treated with (1) deionized water (control); (2) buchneri 500 (buc; 1x10(5) cfu/g of pediococcus pentosaceus  12455 and 4x10(5) cfu/g of lactobacillus buchneri 40788; lallemand animal nutrition, milwaukee, wi); (3) sodium benzoate (ben; 0.1% of fresh forage); (4) silage savor acid mixture (sav: 0.1% of fresh forage; kemin industries inc., des  moines, ia); (5) 1x10(6) cfu/g of acetobacter pasteurianus-atcc 9323; (6) 1x10(6) cfu/g of gluconobacter oxydans-atcc 621; (7) ecosyl 200t (1x10(5) cfu/g of lactobacillus plantarum mtd/1; ecosyl products inc., byron, il); (8) silo-king ws (1.5x10(5) cfu/g of l. plantarum, p. pentosaceus and enterococcus faecium; agri-king, fulton, il); and (9) biomax 5 (bio; 1x10(5) cfu/g of l. plantarum pa-28 and k-270; chr. hansen animal health and nutrition, milwaukee, wi). treated forage was ensiled in quadruplicate in mini silos at a density of 172 kg of dm/m(3) for 3 and 120 d. after 3 d of ensiling, the ph of all silages was below 4 but ethanol concentrations were least in ben silage (2.03 vs. 3.24% dm) and lactic acid was greatest in sav silage (2.97 vs. 2.51% dm). among 120-d silages,  additives did not affect dm recovery (mean=89.8% +/- 2.27) or in vitro dm digestibility (mean=71.5% +/- 0.63). the sav silage had greater ammonia-n (0.85 g/kg of dm) and butyric acid (0.22 vs. 0.0% dm) than other treatments. in contrast, ben and silo-king silages had the least ammonia-n concentration and had no butyric acid. the ben and a. pasteurianus silages had the lowest ph (3.69) and ben silage had the least ethanol (1.04% dm) and ammonia nitrogen (0.64 g/kg dm) concentrations, suggesting that fermentation was more extensive and protein degradation was less in ben silages. the buc and bio silages had greater acetic acid concentrations than control silages (3.19 and 3.19 vs. 2.78% dm), but yeast  counts did not differ. aerobic stability was increased by 64% by buc (44.30 h) and by 35% by ben (36.49 h), but other silages had similar values (27.0+/-1.13 h).

TI  == antimicrobial activity, antibiotic susceptibility and virulence factors of lactic acid bacteria of aquatic origin intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.
AB  == background: the microorganisms intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture should exert antimicrobial activity and be regarded as safe not only for the aquatic hosts but also for their surrounding environments and humans. the objective of this work was to investigate the antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity  against fish pathogens, the antibiotic susceptibility, and the prevalence of virulence factors and detrimental enzymatic activities in 99 lactic acid bacteria (lab) (59 enterococci and 40 non-enterococci) isolated from aquatic animals regarded as human food. results: these lab displayed a broad antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity against the main gram-positive and gram-negative fish pathogens. however, particular safety concerns based on antibiotic resistance and virulence factors were identified in the genus enterococcus (86%) (enterococcus faecalis, 100%; e. faecium, 79%). antibiotic resistance was also found in the genera weissella (60%), pediococcus (44%), lactobacillus (33%), but not in leuconostocs and lactococci. antibiotic resistance genes were found in 7.5% of the non-enterococci, including the genera  pediococcus (12.5%) and weissella (6.7%). one strain of both pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella cibaria carried the erythromycin resistance gene mef(a/e), and another two p. pentosaceus strains harboured lnu(a) conferring resistance to lincosamides. gelatinase activity was found in e. faecalis and e. faecium (71 and 11%, respectively), while a low number of e. faecalis (5%) and none e. faecium exerted hemolytic activity. none enterococci and non-enterococci  showed bile deconjugation and mucin degradation abilities, or other detrimental enzymatic activities. conclusions: to our knowledge, this is the first description of mef(a/e) in the genera pediococcus and weissella, and lnu(a) in the genus pediococcus. the in vitro subtractive screening presented in this work  constitutes a valuable strategy for the large-scale preliminary selection of putatively safe lab intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.

TI  == analysis of microflora profile in korean traditional nuruk.
AB  == a variety of nuruk were collected from various provinces in korea, and their microflora profiles were analyzed at the species level. a total of 42 nuruk samples were collected and when the viable cell numbers in these nuruk were enumerated, the average cell numbers of bacteria, fungi, yeast, and lactic acid bacteria from all nuruk were 7.21, 7.91, 3.49, and 4.88 log cfu/10 g, respectively. there were no significant differences in viable cell numbers of bacteria or fungi according to regions collected. bacillus amyloliquefaciens and  b. subtilis were the predominant bacterial strains in most samples. a significant portion, 13 out of 42 nuruk, contained foodborne pathogens such as b. cereus or cronobacter sakazakii. there were various species of lactic acid bacteria such as enterococcus faecium and pediococcus pentosaceus in nuruk. it was unexpectedly found that only 13 among the 42 nuruk samples contained aspergillus oryzae, the representative saccharifying fungi in makgeolli, whereas a fungi lichtheimia corymbifera was widely distributed in nuruk. it was also found that pichia jadinii was the predominant yeast strain in most nuruk, but the representative alcohol fermentation strain, saccharomyces cerevisiae, was isolated from only 18  out of the 42 nuruk. these results suggested that a variety of species of fungi and yeast were distributed in nuruk and involved in the fermentation of makgeolli. in this study, a total of 64 bacterial species, 39 fugal species, and  15 yeast species were identified from nuruk. among these strains, 37 bacterial species, 20 fungal species, and 8 yeast species were distributed less than 0.1%.

TI  == potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria of human origin induce antiproliferation of colon cancer cells via synergic actions in adhesion to cancer cells and short-chain fatty acid bioproduction.
AB  == the activities and modes of probiotic action of lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant feces were investigated for alternative application in the prevention and biotherapy of colon cancer. from a total of 81 isolates of gram-positive rod  and cocci bacteria obtained from healthy infants, only 15 isolates had the probiotic criteria which included growth inhibition against eight food-borne pathogens, no blood hemolysis, and tolerance to gastrointestinal tract properties such as ph 2.5 and 0.3 % bile salt. four probiotic bacteria showed antiproliferation of colon cancer cells with the use of mtt and trypan blue exclusion assay at the rates of 17-35 %. through comparison of probiotic 16s rrna sequences, they were identified as pediococcus pentosaceus fp3, lactobacillus salivarius fp25, l. salivarius fp35, and enterococcus faecium fp51. finding the mechanism of proliferative inhibition of colon cancer cells in this study indicated synergic induction by probiotic bacteria directly adhered to these cancer cells and triggered the bioproduction of short-chain fatty acids, mainly butyric and propionic acids. this study suggested that the use of these probiotics may be suitable as an alternative bioprophylactic and biotherapeutic strategy for colon cancer.

TI  == interactive effects of ph and temperature on the bacteriocin stability by response surface analysis.
AB  == the combined influence of ph and temperature on bacteriocins produced by three lactic acid bacteria, pediococcus pentosaceus mmz26, enterococcus faecium mmz17 and lactococcus lactis mmz25, isolated from tunisian traditional dry fermented meat was studied using a second order orthogonal factorial design and response-surface methodology (rsm). this method allows estimating the interactive effects of ph and temperature on the stability of each bacteriocin. the high heat stability of the three bacteriocins was demonstrated, with optimum values at light acidic ph around 5.0, temperature below 90 degrees c and short incubation times. this study contributes to a better understanding of relation between bacteriocins production and stability in order to enhance their, in situ, application as a food and feed biopreservative in fermented and/or heated food products.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == detection and characterization of pediocin pa-1/ach like bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == fifty-five bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from seven different sources. eight isolates were found to produce pediocin pa-1 like bacteriocin as detected by pedb gene pcr and dot-blot hybridization. the culture  filtrate (cf) activity of these isolates exhibited strong antilisterial, antibacterial activity against tested food-borne pathogens and lab. the identification and genetic diversity among the selected lab was performed by conventional morphological and molecular tools like rflp, rapd, and 16s rdna gene sequencing. the isolates were identified as, 1 each of pediococcus acidilactici cb1, lactobacillus plantarum acr2, and streptococcus equinus ac1, 2 were of p. pentosaceus cb4 and r38, and other 3 were enterococcus faecium acr4, bl1, v3. partial characterization of the bacteriocins revealed that the peptide was heat-stable, active at acidic to alkaline ph, inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, and had molecular weight around 4.6 kda and shared the properties of class iia pediocin-family. the bacteriocin production at different temperatures, ph, and salt concentrations was studied to investigate the optimal condition for application of these isolates as a starter culture or as a biopreservative in either acidic or non-acidic foods.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == coculture with specific bacteria enhances survival of lactobacillus plantarum nc8, an autoinducer-regulated bacteriocin producer, in olive fermentations.
AB  == bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum nc8 is activated by coculture with specific bacteriocin production-inducing bacterial strains. the system is further regulated by a three-component regulatory system involving a specific autoinducer peptide (plnc8if). we have used l. plantarum nc8 as a starter culture in spanish-style green olive fermentations and examined the influence of coculturing in its survival. we found that l. plantarum nc8 greatly enhanced its  growth and survival in the olive fermentations when co-inoculated with two specific bacteriocin-production inducing strains, i.e. enterococcus faecium 6t1a-20 and pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63, when compared to singly-inoculated fermentations. in addition, a constitutive bacteriocin-producer nc8-derivative strain was used as a control in the olive fermentations and showed also better viability than the parental nc8 strain. our results suggest the involvement of bacteriocin production in the viability enhancement found in both cases. we postulate that the presence of specific bacteria is recognized by l. plantarum nc8 as an environmental stimulus to switch a specific adaptive response on, most  probably involving bacteriocin production. the design of novel bacteriocin-producing starter cultures for food fermentations should consider their constitutive versus regulated character.

TI  == characterisation and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes from lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs were analysed for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. thirty-seven isolates (12 enterococci, 10 lactobacilli, 8 streptococci, 3 lactococci, 2 leuconostoc, and 2  pediococci) were examined for phenotypic resistance using the e-test and their minimum inhibitory concentration to a panel of six antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) was recorded. the corresponding genetic determinants responsible were characterised by pcr. also, the transferability of these resistance markers was assessed in filter mating assays. of the 37 isolates, 33 were found to be resistant to one or more antibiotics. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. the erm(b) and msra/b genes were detected among the 11 erythromycin-resistant strains of enterococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci. two tetracycline-resistant strains, lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides spp., contained tet(m) and tet(s) genes respectively. intrinsic streptomycin resistance was observed in lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci and leuconostoc species; none of the common genetic determinants (stra, strb, aada, aade) were identified. four of 10 strains of enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin; however, no corresponding genetic determinants for this  phenotype were identified. enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to vancomycin. l. plantarum, l. mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus were intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants was demonstrated in one strain, wherein the tet(m) gene of l. plantarum (23) isolated from a pork abattoir was transferred to lactococcus lactis bu-2-60 and to e. faecalis jh2-2. this study identified the presence of antibiotic resistance markers in irish meat isolates and, in one example, resistance was conjugally transferred to other lab strains.

TI  == polyphasic taxonomic studies of lactic acid bacteria associated with tunisian fermented meat based on the heterogeneity of the 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer region.
AB  == the objective of this work was to investigate the structure and diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in traditionally fermented meat collected  from different areas of tunisia. a polyphasic study, which involves phenotypic tests and ribosomal dna-based techniques, was used to identify gram-positive and  catalase-negative isolates. pcr amplification of the 16s-23s rdna isr of 102 isolates and other reference lab strains gave (1) one type of rrn operon (m-isr)  for lactococci, (2) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and m-isr) for enterococci, (3) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and l-isr) for lactobacilli, and (4) three pcr amplicons (s-isr, m-isr, and l-isr) obtained for pediococcus spp. and weissella genus. the clustering and comparison of isr-rflp profiles given by the isolates with those given by reference lab strains, allowed their identification as lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sanguinicola, enterococcus hawaiiensis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus alimentarius, pediococcus pentosaceus, and weissella confusa. combined 16s-23s rdna isr and rflp patterns can be considered as a good potential target for a rapid and reliable differentiation between isolates of lab and provided further information on the organization of their rrn operons.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria as reducing and capping agent for the fast and efficient production of silver nanoparticles.
AB  == there is a growing demand for silver-based biocides, including both ionic silver  forms and metallic nanosilver. the use of metallic nanosilver, typically chemically produced, faces challenges including particle agglomeration, high costs, and upscaling difficulties . additionally, there exists a need for the development of a more eco-friendly production of nanosilver. in this study, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were utilized in the non-enzymatic production of silver nanoparticles via the interaction of silver ions and organic compounds present on the bacterial cell. only lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus spp., pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus faecium, and lactococcus garvieae, were able to reduce silver. the nanoparticles of the five best producing lactobacillus spp. were examined more into detail with transmission electron microscopy. particle localization inside the cell, the mean particle size, and size distribution were species dependent, with lactobacillus fermentum having the smallest mean particle size of 11.2 nm, the most narrow size distribution, and most nanoparticles associated with the outside of the cells. furthermore, influence of ph on the reduction process was investigated. with increasing ph, silver recovery increased as well as the reduction rate as indicated by uv-vis analyses. this study demonstrated that lactobacillus spp. can be used for a rapid and efficient production of silver nanoparticles.

TI  == bacteriocin production by pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from marula (scerocarya birrea).
AB  == strain st44am, isolated from marula, was identified as pediococcus pentosaceus based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (api 50chl), pcr with species-specific primers and 16s rdna sequencing. strain st44am produces a 6.5 kda class iia bacteriocin, active against lactic acid bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and listeria monocytogenes. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, triton x-100, triton x-114, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea, nacl and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at  100 degrees c for 120 min or 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity against l. ivanovii susbp. ivanovii atcc19119 and enterococcus faecium hklhs is bactericidal, resulting in cell lyses and enzyme- and dna-leakage. no significant differences in cell growth and bacteriocin production were observed when strain st44am was cultured in mrs broth at 26 degrees c, 30 degrees c and 37 degrees c for 24 h and tested against the same target strain. l. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii atcc 19119 and e. faecium hklhs did, however, differ in sensitivity to bacteriocin st44am (3.3x10(6) au/ml and 2.6x10(4) au/ml, respectively). peptide st44am adsorbs at high levels (1600 au/ml) to producer cells. bacteriocin st44am  may be a derivative of pediocin pa-1. this is the first report on the presence of p. pentosaceus in marula and a pediocin pa-1 derivative produced by this species. we are also the first to report on the synergetic effect ciprofloxacin has on a pediocin-like bacteriocin.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract of broiler chickens for probiotic use.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize the bacteriocin-producing bacteria (bpb) from the gastrointestinal tract of broiler chickens for probiotic use. methods and results: in total, 291 bacterial strains were isolated from broilers and screened for bacteriocin-producing ability. the bacteriocins produced by enterococcus faecium sh 528, ent. faecium sh 632 and pediococcus pentosaceus sh 740 displayed  inhibitory activity against pathogens including clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. activity of the bacteriocins remained unchanged after 30  min of heat treatment at 60 degrees c or exposure to organic solvents, but diminished after treatment with proteolytic enzymes. pcr was used to detect the structural genes enterocin a and b in sh 528, enterocin l50 and p in sh 632, and  pediocin pa-1 in sh 740. most of them were resistant to 0.5% bile salts and remained viable after 2 h at ph 3.0. ent. faecium sh 528 exhibited the highest amylase activity among the strains tested. conclusions: we selected ent. faecium  sh 528 and sh 632 and ped. pentosaceus sh 740 by probiotic selection criteria including inhibition activity against pathogens. significance and impact of the study: the isolated bpb could potentially be used in the poultry industry as probiotics to control pathogens.

TI  == characterization of anti-listeria bacteriocins isolated from shellfish: potential antimicrobials to control non-fermented seafood.
AB  == this work had as main objectives to characterize two bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) previously isolated from non-fermented seafood, in order to evaluate their potential as new food protective agents. the two bacteriocinogenic isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using genus- and species-specific primers, and confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing,  as enterococcus faecium and pediococcus pentosaceus. the antimicrobial spectrum of each strain included several indicator microorganisms, some of them also isolated from seafood. growth of listeria innocua, l. monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and other lab species were inhibited, although no inhibition of gram-negative microorganisms was observed. proteolytic, but not lipolytic or glycolytic enzymes, completely inactivated the antimicrobial effect of both cell-free supernatants confirming the proteinaceous nature of the  inhibitors. the antimicrobial activity was maintained after treatment with nacl,  sds, triton x-100, tween 20, tween 80 and edta after 2 h or 5 h of exposure and both bacteriocins were stable over a wide range of ph and temperatures. production of bacteriocin by e. faecium (bacalp7) was detected initially at exponential phase and reached a maximum activity of 25,600 au/ml in the early stationary phase, whereas bacteriocin production by p. pentosaceus alp57 (bacalp57) reached the maximum at exponential phase with 12,800 au/ml. the bacteriocins did not kill l. monocytogenes esb54 nor l. innocua 2030c however, cellular growth was reduced. the partially purified bacteriocins, bacalp7 and bacalp57, were below 6.5 kda in size as determined by tricine-sds gel electrophoresis. e. faecium and p. pentosaceus contained dna fragments corresponding in size to those recorded for enterocin b and pediocin pa-1, respectively. sequencing of the fragments from both bacteriocins confirmed the homology. to our knowledge, for the first time two lab producing bacteriocins similar to pediocin pa-1 and enterocin b, were isolated from non-fermented shellfish. the adaptation of the cultures to seafood matrices may be advantageous in terms of application as a biopreservation strategy for reduction of l. monocytogenes levels in seafood products.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

AB  == real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to quantify seven species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in alfalfa silage prepared in the presence or absence of four commercial inoculants and in uninoculated corn stover harvested and stored under a variety of field conditions. species-specific pcr primers were designed based on reca gene sequences. commercial inoculants improved the quality of alfalfa silage, but species corresponding to those in the inoculants displayed variations in persistence over the next 96 h. lactobacillus brevis was the most abundant lab (12 to 32% of total sample dna) in all of the alfalfa silages by 96  h. modest populations (up to 10%) of lactobacillus plantarum were also observed in inoculated silages. pediococcus pentosaceus populations increased over time but did not exceed 2% of the total. small populations (0.1 to 1%) of lactobacillus buchneri and lactococcus lactis were observed in all silages, while lactobacillus pentosus and enterococcus faecium were near or below detection limits. corn stover generally displayed higher populations of l. plantarum and l. brevis and lower populations of other lab species. the data illustrate the utility of rt-pcr for quantifying individual species of lab in conserved forages  prepared under a wide variety of conditions.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == modification of peptidoglycan precursors is a common feature of the low-level vancomycin-resistant vanb-type enterococcus d366 and of the naturally glycopeptide-resistant species lactobacillus casei, pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and enterococcus gallinarum.
AB  == the biochemical basis for the acquired or natural resistance of various gram-positive organisms to glycopeptides was studied by high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of their peptidoglycan udp-murnac-peptide precursors. in all cases, resistance was correlated with partial or complete replacement of the  c-terminal d-ala-d-ala-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide by a new precursor with a modified c terminus. nuclear magnetic resonance analysis by sequential assignment showed that the new precursor encountered in enterococcus faecium d366, a strain belonging to the vanb class, which expresses low-level resistance  to vancomycin, was udp-murnac-l-ala-gamma-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-lactate, identical  to that previously found in the vana class, which expresses high-level resistance to vancomycin. high-pressure liquid chromatographic analyses, composition determinations, and digestion by r39 d,d-carboxypeptidase demonstrated the exclusive presence of the new precursor in lactobacillus casei and pediococcus pentosaceus, which are naturally highly resistant to glycopeptides. the low-level natural resistance of enterococcus gallinarum to vancomycin was found to be associated with the synthesis of a new precursor identified as a udp-murnac-pentapeptide containing a c-terminal d-serine. the distinction between low and high levels of resistance to glycopeptides appeared also to depend on the presence or absence of a substantial residual pool of a d-ala-d-ala-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide.

AB  == a total of 84 of 150 vancomycin-resistant (defined as no inhibition of bacterial  growth around a 30-micrograms vancomycin disk placed on 5% sheep blood-trypticase soy agar [bbl microbiology systems, cockeysville, md.]) bacteria were definitively identified by determining the phenotypic criteria. the identity of representatives was also confirmed by dna-dna hybridizations. the following strains were identified: 1 enterococcus faecium, 18 leuconostoc mesenteroides, 15 leuconostoc citreum, 9 leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 2 leuconostoc lactis, 20  pediococcus acidilactici, 5 pediococcus pentosaceus, and 14 lactobacillus confusus. the remaining vancomycin-resistant strains were identified as probable  leuconostoc (6 strains), probable pediococcus (1 strain), and probable lactobacilli (28 strains). a total of 32 strains of gram-positive coccobacillary  bacteria remained unidentified. tests used for the phenotypic identification of strains to the genus level included a gram stain of bacteria grown in thioglycolate broth, gas production in lactobacillus mann, rogosa, and sharpe broth, hydrolysis of pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide, bile-esculin reaction, demonstration of streptococcal group d antigen, and growth at 10 and 45 degrees c and in 6.5% nacl broth. strains were identified to the species level by hydrolysis of esculin, reactions in litmus milk, slime production on 5% sucrose agar, acidification of maltose, melibiose, and raffinose broths, deamination of arginine, and growth at 42 degrees c and in 6.5% nacl broth.
