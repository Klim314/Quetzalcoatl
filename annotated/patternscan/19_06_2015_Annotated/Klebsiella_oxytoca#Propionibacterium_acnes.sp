TI  == evaluation of the epinecidin-1 peptide as an active ingredient in cleaning solutions against pathogens.
AB  == we tested the activity of epinecidin-1, a novel antimicrobial peptide structurally related to pleurocidin, in commercial cleaning solutions stored at 4 and 25 degrees c for 7 and 14 days. the peptide's activities against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were measured in a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination, minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) determination, disk diffusion test, and a count  of the bacterial numbers. exposure to epinecidn-1 in a cleaning solution following mic value comparisons in the disk diffusion test and counts of bacterial numbers after 16, 24, 48, and 72 h suggested that bacterial numbers were much lower than those treated with only commercial cleaning solutions for all bacteria. the efficacy of the antimicrobial activities of inhibiting bacterial numbers by epinecidin-1 in cleaning solutions at a low ph and a low temperature was not affected. given its simple structure and antimicrobial activity, epinecidin-1 may be a useful component of microbicides designed to prevent pathogen infections and/or remediate abnormal vaginal or skin flora.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  == background: an automated bacterial culture system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. the recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella  oxytoca, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens,  streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu per ml. samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. results:  all organisms, except p. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 cfu/ml) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 cfu/ml) hours. p. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 cfu/ml) or 66.0 (100 cfu/ml) hours. the 10-fold increase in inoculum  was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. the aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours)  between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p <  0.001), respectively. conclusion: no difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. the new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
