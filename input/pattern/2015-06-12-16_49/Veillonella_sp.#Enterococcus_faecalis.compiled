TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - Bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  - Culture-based studies have shown that Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (RC). The purpose of the present study was to assess the bacterial diversity of RC in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. Plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no RC and from 11 subjects with RC. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes from extracted DNA were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. From a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. The majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. Species of Selenomonas and Veillonella were common in all samples. The healthy microbiota included Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Leptotrichia spp., Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus cristatus, and Kingella oralis. Lactobacilli were absent, S. mutans was present in one, and Actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. In contrast, the microbiota of the RC subjects was dominated by Actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, S. mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Selenomonas sp. clone CS002, Atopobium and Olsenella spp., Prevotella multisaccharivorax, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and Propionibacterium sp. strain FMA5. The bacterial profiles of RC showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. The data suggest that putative etiological agents of RC include not only S. mutans, lactobacilli, and Actinomyces but also species of Atopobium, Olsenella, Pseudoramibacter, Propionibacterium, and Selenomonas.
