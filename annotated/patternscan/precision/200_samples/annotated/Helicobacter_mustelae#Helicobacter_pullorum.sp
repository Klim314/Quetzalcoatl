TI == gastric and enterohepatic non-helicobacter pylori helicobacters.
AB == a substantial number of reports published in the last year have contributed to a  better understanding of both human and animal infection with non-helicobacter pylori helicobacter species (nhph). gastric infection of humans with helicobacter suis and helicobacter felis as well as unidentified nhph has been described to cause a chronic gastritis and a variety of clinical symptoms, whereas enterohepatic nhph, including helicobacter cinaedi, helicobacter bilis, and helicobacter canis, have been reported to be associated with human diseases such as bacteremia, cellulitis, cutaneous diseases, and fever of unknown origin in immunocompromised hosts. in various animal species, including dogs and laboratory mice, high rates of infection with nhph were described. for gastric nhph, mainly h. suis and h. felis infection was studied, revealing that differences in the immune response evoked in the host do exist when compared to helicobacter pylori. pathogenic mechanisms of infection with helicobacter pullorum, h. bilis, and helicobacter hepaticus were investigated, as well as immune responses involved in h. bilis-, helicobacter typhlonius-, and h. hepaticus-induced intestinal inflammation. complete genome sequences of helicobacter heilmannii strain asb1 and a h. cinaedi strain isolated in a case of human bacteremia were published, as well as comparative genomics of a human-derived helicobacter bizzozeronii strain and proteome or secretome analyses for h. hepaticus and helicobacter trogontum, respectively. molecular analysis has revealed a function for type vi secretion systems of h. hepaticus and h. pullorum, the helicobacter mustelae iron urease, and several other functional components of nhph. in each section of this chapter, new findings on gastric nhph will first be discussed, followed by those on enterohepatic helicobacter species.

TI == survival of gastric and enterohepatic helicobacter spp. in water: implications for transmission.
AB == part of the reason for rejecting aquatic environments as possible vectors for the transmission of helicobacter pylori has been the preference of this microorganism to inhabit the human stomach and hence use a direct oral-oral route for transmission. on the other hand, most enteric bacterial pathogens are well known for being able to use water as an environmental reservoir. in this work, we have exposed 13 strains of seven different helicobacter spp. (both gastric and enterohepatic) to water and tracked their survival by standard plating methods and membrane integrity assessment. the influence of different plating media and temperatures and the presence of light on recovery was also assessed. there was good correlation between cultivability and membrane integrity results (pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.916), confirming that the culture method could reliably estimate differences in survival among different helicobacter spp. the species that survived the longest in water was h. pylori (>96 h in the dark at 25 degrees c), whereas h. felis appeared to be the most sensitive to water (<6 h). a hierarchical cluster analysis demonstrated that there was no relationship between the enterohepatic nature of helicobacter spp. and an increased time of survival in water. this work assesses for the first time the survival of multiple helicobacter spp., such has h. mustelae, h. muridarum, h. felis, h. canadensis, h. pullorum, and h. canis, in water under several conditions and concludes that the roles of water in transmission between hosts are likely to be similar for all these species, whether enterohepatic or not.

TI == phylogenetic analysis of helicobacter species based on partial gyrb gene sequences.
AB == analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences is one of the most common methods for investigating the phylogeny and taxonomy of bacteria. however, several studies have indicated that the 16s rrna gene does not distinguish between certain helicobacter species. we therefore selected for phylogenetic analysis an alternative marker, gyrb, encoding gyrase subunit b. the aim of this investigation was to examine the applicability of gyrb gene fragments (approximately 1100 bp) for the phylogenetic study of 16 helicobacter species and a total of 33 helicobacter strains included in this study. based on the sequenced fragments, a phylogenetic tree was obtained that contained two distinct clusters, with gastric species forming one cluster and enterohepatic species the other. the only exception was the gastric species helicobacter mustelae, which clustered with the enterohepatic species. the calculated similarity matrix revealed the highest interspecies similarity between helicobacter salomonis and helicobacter felis (89 %) and the lowest similarity between helicobacter pullorum and h. felis (60 %). the dna g+c content of the sequenced fragments was < or =40 mol% in enterohepatic species and >46 mol% in gastric species, excluding helicobacter pylori and h. mustelae, with g+c contents of 34 and 42 mol%, respectively. in summary, the gyrb gene fragments provided superior resolution and reliability to the 16s rrna gene for differentiating between closely related helicobacter species. a further outcome of this study was achieved by designing gyrb gene-based species-specific pcr primers for the identification of helicobacter bizzozeronii.

TI == comparative chemical and biological characterization of the lipopolysaccharides of gastric and enterohepatic helicobacters.
AB == background: the lipopolysaccharide of helicobacter pylori plays an important role in colonization and pathogenicity. the present study sought to compare structural and biological features of lipopolysaccharides from gastric and enterohepatic helicobacter spp. not previously characterized. materials and methods: purified lipopolysaccharides from four gastric helicobacter spp. (h. pylori, helicobacter felis, helicobacter bizzozeronii and helicobacter mustelae) and four enterohepatic helicobacter spp. (helicobacter hepaticus, helicobacter bilis, 'helicobacter sp. flexispira' and helicobacter pullorum) were structurally characterized using electrophoretic, serological and chemical methods. results: structural insights into all three moieties of the lipopolysaccharides, i.e. lipid a, core and o-polysaccharide chains, were gained. all species expressed lipopolysaccharides bearing an o-polysaccharide chain, but h. mustelae and h. hepaticus produced truncated semirough lipopolysaccharides. however, in contrast to lipopolysaccharides of h. pylori and h. mustelae, no blood group mimicry was detected in the other helicobacter spp. examined. intra-species, but not interspecies, fatty acid profiles of lipopolysaccharides were identical within the genus. although shared lipopolysaccharide-core epitopes with h. pylori occurred, differing structural characteristics were noted in this lipopolysaccharide region of some helicobacter spp. the lipopolysaccharides of the gastric helicobacters, h. bizzozeronii and h. mustelae, had relative limulus amoebocyte lysate activities which clustered around that of h. pylori lipopolysaccharide, whereas h. bilis, 'helicobacter sp. flexispira' and h. hepaticus formed a cluster with approximately 1000-10,000-fold lower activities. h. pullorum lipopolysaccharide had the highest relative limulus amoebocyte lysate activity of all the helicobacter lipopolysaccharides (10-fold higher than that of h. pylori lipopolysaccharide), and all the lipopolysaccharides of enterohepatic helicobacter spp. were capable of inducing nuclear factor-kappa b(nf-kappab) activation. conclusions: the collective results demonstrate the structural heterogeneity and pathogenic potential of lipopolysaccharides of the helicobacter genus as a group and these differences in lipopolysaccharides may be indicative of adaptation of the bacteria to different ecological niches.

TI == fluorogenic pcr-based quantitative detection of a murine pathogen, helicobacter hepaticus.
AB == helicobacter hepaticus infection in mice is being used as an animal model for elucidating the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal and biliary diseases in humans. h. hepaticus, which forms a spreading film on selective agar, is not amenable to routine quantitative counts of organisms in tissues using a cfu method. in this study, a fluorogenic pcr-based assay was developed to quantitatively detect h. hepaticus in mouse ceca and feces using the abi prism 7700 sequence detection system. a pair of primers and a probe for this assay were generated from the h. hepaticus cdtb gene (encoding subunit b of the h. hepaticus cytolethal distending toxin). using this assay, the sensitivity for detection of h. hepaticus chromosomal dna prepared from pure culture was 20 fg, which is equivalent to approximately 14 copies of the h. hepaticus genome based on an estimated genome size of approximately 1.3 mb determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. h. hepaticus present in feces and cecal samples from h. hepaticus-infected mice was readily quantified. the selected pcr primers and probe did not generate fluorescent signals from eight other helicobacters (h. canis, h. cineadi, h. felis, h. mustelae, h. nemestrinae, h. pullorum, h. pylori, and h. rodentium). a fluorescent signal was detected from 20 ng of h. bilis dna but with much lower sensitivity (10(6)-fold) than from h. hepaticus dna. therefore, this assay can be used with high sensitivity and specificity to quantify h. hepaticus in experimentally infected mouse models as well as in naturally infected mice.

TI == the 26-kilodalton, ahpc homologue, of helicobacter pylori is also produced by other helicobacter species.
AB == background: the 26 kda protein, which is an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahpc)  homologue, has earlier been described as specific for helicobacter pylori. the aims of this study were to analyse whether this protein, or the corresponding gene, could be identified in other helicobacter species. materials and methods: two different monoclonal antibodies (mabs), which recognise the 26 kda protein in h. pylori, were used in immunoblots to determine the presence of the protein in 10 helicobacter species. pcr was performed in order to analyse whether the gene was detectable and the pcr products were sequenced. southern and northern blot analyses were done on chromosomal dna and total rna, respectively, isolated from some selected helicobacter species in order to compare the genes and mrna transcripts to h. pylori. results: the 26 kda protein was identified in h. nemestrinae (primate), h. acinonychis (cheetah), h. bilis (mouse), h. felis (cat) and h. salomonis (dog) but not in h. mustelae (ferret), h. cinaedi (human), h. canis (dog), h. fennelliae (human) or h. pullorum (poultry). by pcr the gene was also recognised in h. mustelae, h. cinaedi and h. pullorum. the pcr products showed high sequence homology (66-98%) compared to h. pylori. the gene was also highly conserved in four h. pylori strains (94-99% homology). southern blot showed that the h. nemestrinae and h. acinonychis chromosomal dna contained a single copy of the gene and the northern blot analyses indicated mono-cistronic transcription of the gene in these two species, as has been found in h. pylori. conclusions: a gene similar to ahpc was found in eight out of 10 helicobacter species analysed.
