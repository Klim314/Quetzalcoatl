TI  == genetic and biochemical approaches towards unravelling the degradation of gallotannins by streptococcus gallolyticus.
AB  == background: herbivores have developed mechanisms to overcome adverse effects of dietary tannins through the presence of tannin-resistant bacteria. tannin degradation is an unusual characteristic among bacteria. streptococcus gallolyticus is a common tannin-degrader inhabitant of the gut of herbivores where plant tannins are abundant. the biochemical pathway for tannin degradation  followed by s. gallolyticus implies the action of tannase and gallate decarboxylase enzymes to produce pyrogallol, as final product. from these proteins, only a tannase (tanbsg) has been characterized so far, remaining still  unknown relevant proteins involved in the degradation of tannins. results: in addition to tanbsg, genome analysis of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains revealed the presence of an additional protein similar to tannases, tanasg (gallo_0933). interestingly, this analysis also indicated that only s. gallolyticus strains belonging to the subspecies "gallolyticus" possessed tannase copies. this observation was confirmed by pcr on representative strains from different subspecies. in s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus the genes encoding gallate decarboxylase are clustered together and close to tanbsg, however, tanasg is not located in the vicinity of other genes involved in tannin metabolism. the  expression of the genes enconding gallate decarboxylase and the two tannases was  induced upon methyl gallate exposure. as tanbsg has been previously characterized, in this work the tannase activity of tanasg was demonstrated in presence of phenolic acid esters. tanasg showed optimum activity at ph 6.0 and 37 degrees c. as compared to the tannin-degrader lactobacillus plantarum strains, s. gallolyticus presented several advantages for tannin degradation. most of the l.  plantarum strains possessed only one tannase enzyme (tanblp), whereas all the s.  gallolytcius subsp. gallolyticus strains analyzed possesses both tanasg and tanbsg proteins. more interestingly, upon methyl gallate induction, only the tanb lp gene was induced from the l. plantarum tannases; in contrast, both tannase genes were highly induced in s. gallolyticus. finally, both s. gallolyticus tannase proteins presented higher activity than their l. plantarum counterparts.  conclusions: the specific features showed by s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus  in relation to tannin degradation indicated that strains from this subspecies could be considered so far the best bacterial cellular factories for tannin degradation.

TI  == characterization of a bacterial tannase from streptococcus gallolyticus ucn34 suitable for tannin biodegradation.
AB  == the gene in the locus gallo_1609 from streptococcus gallolyticus ucn34 was cloned and expressed as an active protein in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). the protein was named tansg1 since it shows similarity to bacterial tannases previously described. the recombinant strain produced his-tagged tansg1 which was purified by affinity chromatography. purified tansg1 protein showed tannase activity, having a specific activity of 577 u/mg which is 41 % higher than the activity of  lactobacillus plantarum tannase. remarkably, tansg1 displayed optimum catalytic activity at ph 6-8 and 50-70 degrees c and showed high stability over a broad range of temperatures. it retained 25 % of its relative activity after prolonged  incubation at 45 degrees c. the specific activity of tansg1 is enhanced by the divalent cation ca(2+) and is dramatically reduced by zn(2+) and hg(2+). the enzyme was highly specific for gallate and protocatechuate esters and showed no catalytic activity against other phenolic esters. the protein tansg1 hydrolyzes efficiently tannic acid, a complex and polymeric gallotanin, allowing its complete conversion to gallic acid, a potent antioxidant. from its biochemical properties, tansg1 is a tannase with potential industrial interest regarding the  biodegradation of tannin waste or its bioconversion into biologically active products.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and in situ amylase expression during traditional fermentation of cereal foods.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria play an important role in traditional fermented foods consumed in different countries. study of their taxonomic structure and diversity is necessary for starter culture selection, improved safety and nutritional enhancement. to achieve these objectives, microbial genomic typing methods were used to study genetic differences of autochthonous bacteria and their distribution in two traditional african fermented cereal foods. a total of 85 predominant bacterial species were isolated from ogi and kunu-zaki obtained from  northern and southern geographical region of nigeria. they were identified using  combination of 16s rrna gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) based on rpoa, phes and atpa genes as well as m13-pcr gel fingerprints. the results showed that lactobacillus fermentum was the most frequently isolated species in ogi (71.4%) and kunu-zaki (84.5%). other species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) identified were lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. non lactic acid bacteria isolated from these foods were species belonging to the bacillus and staphylococcus. non-metric multidimensional scaling (nmds) analysis of the m13-pcr fingerprints for lab strains showed clonal diversity among strains of the same species. in vitro and in situ expression of amylase gene during fermentation by amylolytic l. plantarum ulag11 was detected, indicating the potential usefulness of such species for development of starter cultures and for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == association of tannase-producing staphylococcus lugdunensis with colon cancer and characterization of a novel tannase gene.
AB  == background: the relationship between streptococcus (st.) bovis endocarditis and colon cancer is well known. in st. bovis, the biotype i strain (formerly, st. gallolyticus) produces tannase that degrades tannins. the aim of this study was to investigate the association of tannase-producing bacteria with colon cancer, and to identify the major tannase-producing bacteria and the gene involved. methods: tannase-producing bacteria were isolated in tannic acid-treated selective agar medium from feces and rectal swabs of 357 patients who underwent colon endoscopy from 1999 to 2004. results: tannase-producing bacteria were isolated more frequently from the colon cancer group (24.3%) than from the adenoma or normal groups (14.4%; p < 0.05). s. gallolyticus, staphylococcus (s.)  lugdunensis, lactobacillus (l.) plantarum, and l. pentosus were all identified as tannase-producing bacteria. of these, s. lugdunensis was significantly isolated from the advanced-stage cancer group (22.2%; p < 0.001) more than from the early-stage cancer (8.6%) or adenoma (4.9%) groups. the gene (tana) for tannase in s. lugdunensis was cloned and sequenced. the tana gene was associated with all s. lugdunensis but not with other bacteria by southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction. conclusions: tannase-producing s. lugdunensis is associated with  advanced-stage colon cancer, and the tana gene is a useful marker for the detection of s. lugdunensis.
