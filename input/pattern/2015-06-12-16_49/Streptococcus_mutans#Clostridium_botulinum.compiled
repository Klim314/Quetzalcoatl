TI  - Antimicrobial activity of foodborne Paenibacillus and Bacillus spp. against Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - The saprophytic Paenibacillus and Bacillus spp. found in cooked chilled foods may have an effect on the growth of Clostridium botulinum, a major microbiological hazard, especially for pasteurized vacuum-packaged products. Culture supernatants of 200 strains of Paenibacillus and Bacillus strains isolated from commercial cooked chilled foods containing vegetables were screened for activity against C. botulinum type A, proteolytic type B, and type E strains in a well diffusion assay. Nineteen strains were positive against C. botulinum. Among those, seven Paenibacillus polymyxa strains showed the highest antibotulinal activity and the largest antimicrobial spectrum against C. botulinum strains. The antibotulinal activity was evaluated throughout the growth of a representative strain of the positive P. polymyxa strains. The antimicrobial activity was detected in the culture supernatant from late-log/early stationary phase of the bacteria, which occurred after 7 to 10 days of incubation at 10 degrees C and after 2 to 3 days at 20 degrees C in nutrient broth and in vegetable purees under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. In co-cultures with the positive strain of P. polymyxa in nutrient broth and vegetable purees, a C. botulinum type E strain was inhibited whenever P. polymyxa reached stationary phase and produced its antimicrobial activity before C. botulinum began its exponential growth phase. The antimicrobial activity of P. polymyxa against C. botulinum was attributed to the production of antimicrobial peptides resistant to high temperature and acidity. Other gram-positive and -negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus subtilis) were also sensitive to these antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - Genetic characterisation of the botulinum toxin complex of Clostridium botulinum  strain NCTC 2916.
AB  - An 8 kb segment of the Clostridium botulinum NCTC 2916 genome 5' to the type A botulinum neurotoxin gene has been sequenced revealing five open reading frames. Four encode components (HA70, HA17, HA34 and NTNH/A) of the progenitor toxin complex. The product of the fifth, OrfX, possesses a putative C-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, exhibits homology with known regulatory proteins (including MsmR from Streptococcus mutans, UviA from C. perfringens and Orftxe1 located upstream of the C. difficile toxin B gene) and is also found within the vicinity of genes encoding tetanus toxin and types B, C, D and G botulinum toxins. Primer extension and Northern blotting analysis demonstrates that the genes are expressed as two divergent operons [HA34, HA17, HA70] and [NTNH/A, type A toxin gene], with the OrfX gene expressed singly. Immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start sites of the HA34 and NTNH/A genes are two highly conserved motifs (5'-ATTTTagGTTTACAAAA-3' and 5'-ATGTTATATgTaA-3'), separated by 12 bp, that span the putative -35 and -10 promoter regions. Homologous sequences occur in the equivalent position relative to the genes at type C botulinum toxin gene and the tetanus toxin gene loci. It is likely that these sequence motifs, together with OrfX, are involved in the co-ordinate expression of the genes encoding the various components of the botulinum toxin complex in groups I, III and IV C. botulinum strains and in that of the tetanus toxin gene.
