TI  == fusobacterium species infections: clinical spectrum and outcomes at a district general hospital.
AB  == purpose: fusobacterium species infections are rare. recently, however, this potentially deadly pathogen has been attracting interest, and efforts are being made to characterise its epidemiology and clinical spectrum of disease. the aim of our study is to provide further evidence towards this cause, in what is, to date, the largest study of its kind from the uk. method: a 22-year, retrospective, descriptive study was performed at royal hampshire county hospital. an electronic database was used to identify patients with microbiologically confirmed infection with fusobacterium, and clinical records were examined to provide further information on the presentation, source, treatment and outcome. results: fusobacterium species infections were identified  in 18 patients during the study period, which is an incidence of 0.76 cases/100,000/year. the overall death rate was 29 %. half of these patients had fusobacterium necrophorum infections and were a predominantly young, fit and uniquely male population who had excellent outcomes. among the remaining patients with fusobacterium species infections, 22 % had infection with f. varium and 11 % with f. nucleatum. these patients were an older cohort who tended to have co-morbidities and unsurprisingly worse outcomes. we identified a number of fusobacterium bacteraemias likely to have resulted from pressure ulcers, a presentation that has been rarely reported. interestingly, we also identified a case of neonatal f. nucleatum bacteraemia that was not associated with premature  nor stillborn birth. conclusion: as work continues to depict the spectrum of disease caused by this enigmatic bacterium, it is hoped that improved clinical suspicion will result in better outcomes and management.

TI  == in vitro activity of biapenem plus rpx7009, a carbapenem combined with a serine beta-lactamase inhibitor, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == biapenem is a carbapenem being developed in combination with rpx7009, a new inhibitor of serine beta-lactamases. biapenem was tested alone and in combination with fixed concentrations of rpx7009 by agar dilution against 377 recent isolates of anaerobes. a separate panel of 27 isolates of bacteroides spp. with decreased  susceptibility or resistance to imipenem was also tested. comparator drugs included meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, metronidazole, clindamycin, and tigecycline plus imipenem, doripenem, and ertapenem for the 27 selected strains. for recent consecutive strains of bacteroides species, the mic(90) for biapenem-rpx7009 was 1 mug/ml, with a mic(90) of 4 mug/ml for meropenem. other bacteroides fragilis group species showed a mic90 of 0.5 mug/ml for both agents. the mic(90)s for biapenem-rpx7009 were 0.25 mug/ml for prevotella spp., 0.125 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum, 2 mug/ml for fusobacterium mortiferum, 0.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium varium, </= 0.5 mug/ml for gram-positive cocci and rods, and 0.03 to 8 mug/ml for clostridia. against 5 b. fragilis strains harboring a known metallo-beta-lactamase, biapenem-rpx7009 mics were comparable to those of other carbapenems (>/= 32 mug/ml). against bacteroides strains with an imipenem mic of 2 mug/ml, biapenem-rpx7009 had mics of 0.5 to 2 mug/ml, with mics of 0.5 to 32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. for strains with an imipenem mic of 4 mug/ml, the mics for biapenem-rpx7009 were  4 to 16 mug/ml, with mics of 8 to >32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. the inhibitor rpx7009 had no antimicrobial activity when tested alone, and it showed little or no potentiation of biapenem versus anaerobes. biapenem-rpx7009 showed activity comparable to that of imipenem and was superior  to meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem against imipenem-nonsusceptible bacteroides spp.

TI  == identification of a 43-kda outer membrane protein of fusobacterium necrophorum that exhibits similarity with pore-forming proteins of other fusobacterium species.
AB  == a pair of primers was designed in an attempt to amplify outer membrane protein (omp) gene of fusobacterium necrophorum based on nucleotide sequence of the omp of fusobacterium nucleatum. further analysis was performed to characterize its molecular properties and phylogeny in the genus fusobacterium. we identified a predicated 43kda outer membrane protein (43k omp) in f. necrophorum, which showed the same properties as other pore-forming proteins of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria according to analysis of signal peptide, at-rich, membrane-spanning region and conserved motifs. the predicated 43k omp exhibited 70.22%, 62.04%, 56.75%, 58.72%, 51.59%, 31.49% and 50.26% amino acid identity with the omps of f. nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, fusobacterium ucerans, fusobacterium periodonticum, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium gonidiaformans and f. necrophorum (hypothetical protein), respectively. 11 common conserved domains and 10 common variable domains were found among the 45 aligned omps of fusobacterium  species. distributions of the conserved and variable domains were highly associated with predicted membrane-spanning regions, cell surface exposed regions and b-cell epitope regions. phylogenetic analysis revealed the predicated 43k omp of f. necrophorum was closely related with the omps from f. nucleatum and f. periodonticum. these data will increase understanding of pathogenesis and genetic evolution of f. necrophorum.

TI  == lemierre's syndrome, reemergence of a forgotten disease: a case report.
AB  == lemierre's syndrome is a rare disorder of young adults caused by the anaerobic bacterium, fusobacterium necrophorum and occasionally by other fusobacterium species (f. nucleatum, f. mortiferum and f. varium etc). the condition is characterized by a primary oropharyngeal infection with evidence of septic thrombophlebitis, exhibited by positive blood cultures, clinical or radiographic  evidence of internal jugular vein thrombosis, and at least one metastatic focus.  the incidence of lemierre's syndrome is reported to be nearly one in a million. in the pre-antibiotic era, lemierre's syndrome followed a fulminant, often fatal  course. during the 1960s and 1970s, the syndrome was rarely reported when penicillin was commonly prescribed to treat oropharyngeal infections. today, antibiotic-resistant organisms are a major concern, thus causing more prudent prescribing of antibiotics. we present a case report of a 27-year-old man with worsening pharyngitis, which illustrates that subsequent reemergence of this often forgotten disease may become more common in clinical setting.

TI  == stimulation of epithelial cell matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-2, -9, -13) and interleukin-8 secretion by fusobacteria.
AB  == background/aims: bacterial pathogens involved in periodontal diseases exert their destructive effects primarily by stimulating the host cells to increase their secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). this study aimed to determine the epithelial cell matrix metalloproteinase and interleukin-8 (il-8) secretion upon exposure to fusobacteria. methods: eight different oral and non-oral fusobacterium strains were incubated with hacat epithelial cells. gelatin zymography and western blot analysis were performed to  detect collagenase 3 (mmp-13), gelatinase a (mmp-2), gelatinase b (mmp-9), and il-8 secretion by epithelial cells. results: all fusobacterium strains, especially fusobacterium necrophorum atcc 25286, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, and fusobacterium varium atcc 51644, increased mmp-9 and mmp-13 secretion. fusobacterium simiae atcc 33568, and to a lesser extent f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum, increased epithelial mmp-2 secretion. f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum also increased il-8 secretion. f. varium atcc 27725, a strain that only weakly stimulated mmp production, strongly increased the il-8 production, suggesting that their expression is differently regulated. conclusion: we conclude that the pathogenic potential of fusobacteria may partly result from their ability to stimulate secretion of mmp-9, mmp-13, and il-8 from epithelial cells.

TI  == [application of "microring an" to "level 1": presumptive identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == commonly isolated anaerobic gram-negative rods (4 genus 64 strains), some other important gram-negative anaerobic species (9 genus 45 strains), and cigar-shaped  clostridia (11 strains) were studied on their susceptibility patterns to 6 agents on "microring an". some modifications were made in the methods and interpretation of results. susceptibility patterns to erythromycin, rifampicin, colistin, benzylpenicillin, kanamycin, and vancomycin were following (sensitive [s], intermediate [i], resistant [r], variable [v]): for bacteroides fragilis group, v, s, r, r, r, r, respectively; for non-pigmented prevotella, v, s, v, v, r, r, respectively; for pigmented prevotella, s, s, sr, v, v, r, respectively: for fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum, r(s), s(i), s(ir), s(r), s, r, respectively; and for f. varium, r, r, s/i, r(s), s, r, respectively. some results were different from that in the data table in the instruction of "microring an", because of differences of methodology and changes of susceptibility of those species during years. as to the other groups, that are not included in the data table in the instruction, results were following: for bilophila wadsworthia, r, r, s, r, s, r, respectively; desulfovibrio, v, r(s), r, r, s, r, respectively; for cigar-shaped clostridia, v, s(r), r, r, s(r), s, respectively. "microring an" was useful for presumptive identification in genus, species, or group level, though morphological observation and some additional simple tests such as bile-sensitivity and catalase were essential.

TI  == physiological alterations of a fusobacterium nucleatum strain exposed to oxidative stress.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oxidative stress  on physiological and genetic characteristics of fusobacterium nucleatum and its interference on this microbial identification methods. methods and results: fus.  nucleatum ssp. nucleatum atcc 25586 (wt-strain) and an oxidative-stress-adapted strain derived from the wt-strain (aero-strain) were employed in the study. cell-free crude protein extracts were obtained from both strains and differentially expressed proteins were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis. bacterium identification was performed by conventional biochemical tests, automated rapid id 32a system and specific pcr analysis. genetic diversity between wt- and aero-strain was assessed by arbitrarily-primed  (ap)-pcr. there were significant changes in the protein profile of aero-strain. the identification of the wt-strain was confirmed by all methods employed. similar results were obtained for aero-strain when conventional biochemical tests and pcr were used. however, aero-strain was identified as fusobacterium varium when submitted to rapid id 32a system. according to ap-pcr analysis, no significant genetic alteration was detected in aero-strain. conclusions: the adaptive response of fus. nucleatum to oxidative stress is associated with changes on its biology, which may lead to misidentification of the organism, according to the conventional identification methods. significance and impact of  the study: oxidative stress may act as a cause of adaptive response in fus. nucleatum with consequences to its biology, such as alterations on biochemical and physiological profile.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid against clinical isolates of fusobacterium spp.
AB  == objectives: although most susceptibility studies for linezolid have investigated  aerobic bacteria, only a few have investigated anaerobe isolates. the aim of the  present study was to determine the antibacterial activity of linezolid against a  larger sample of clinical isolates of fusobacterium spp. and to report on the detailed susceptibility, stratified by species. methods: the in vitro susceptibility of 80 clinical isolates of fusobacterium (fusobacterium necrophorum, n = 34; fusobacterium nucleatum, n = 20; fusobacterium varium, n = 18; fusobacterium mortiferum; n = 8) was tested and compared with the activity of the older compounds amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. results: the mic of linezolid ranged from 0.016 to 1.0 mg/l, with the mic(90) being 0.5 mg/l. the  highest mic obtained for linezolid (1.0 mg/l) was measured for an f. varium isolate. the mic(90) for both, amoxicillin (range: 0.016-0.75 mg/l) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range: 0.047-0.75 mg/l), was 0.5 mg/l. overall, no resistant strains were found in the study. conclusions: compared with amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, linezolid was less active against f. necrophorum (mic(90) 0.25 mg/l) and f. nucleatum (mic(90) 0.25 mg/l), equally active against  f. varium (mic(90) 0.75 mg/l) and slightly more active against f. mortiferum (mic(90) 0.19 mg/l).

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium varium and fusobacterium nucleatum based on gyrb gene sequences.
AB  == the nucleotide sequences of the dna gyrase b subunit gene (gyrb) of fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. necrophorum, f. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme and f. varium  were determined and analyzed together with those of f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and f. nucleatum subsp. vincentii. on the phylogenetic tree constructed, the strains of each fusobacterial species formed distinct clusters with deep sublines. the degree of sequence similarity within each cluster was 93.2% or more, whereas similarities between clusters ranged from 70.1 to 72.7%. these clusters were recovered with 100% bootstrap probabilities and are in very good agreement with the species of fusobacterium. these data suggest that gyrb is an accurate genealogical marker for the classification of the fusobacterial taxa considered in this study.

TI  == in vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == update on the taxonomy and clinical aspects of the genus fusobacterium.
AB  == the genus fusobacterium currently includes 13 species. fusobacterium nucleatum, the most frequently encountered species in humans, is heterogeneous and currently includes 5 subspecies. a potentially new subspecies of f. nucleatum that is intrinsically quinolone-resistant and phylogenetically separate from the other 5  subspecies has been identified from dog and cat oral flora. two subspecies have been described for fusobacterium necrophorum, and a new species, fusobacterium equinum, which is related to f. necrophorum, has been described from horse oral flora. additional molecular studies have characterized fusobacterium ulcerans as  separate from the phenotypically similar fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium. fusobacterium sulci and fusobacterium alocis have been reclassified as eubacterium sulci and filifactor alocis, respectively. fusobacterium prausnitzii is phylogenetically related to the eubacterium-like organisms and will likely be reclassified in the future. the status of the remaining species is unchanged.

TI  == 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer sequences for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus fusobacterium.
AB  == the 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of all currently defined fusobacterium species and related taxa such as leptotrichia buccalis, sebaldella termitidis and streptobacillus moniliformans, were analysed to examine inter- and intraspecies as well as subspecies relationships. for the its-amplification, a new eubacterial universal primer pair was designed and used. the majority of the fusobacterium strains, along with l. buccalis showed one major, and two to three weaker, distinct bands (short and long versions) with lengths of 800-830 bp and 1000-1100 bp. nevertheless, six other patterns were also found within the genus fusobacterium, demonstrating its heterogeneity. the its region was sequenced and found to consist both of conserved motifs, which functioned as a framework for alignment, and of variable sites, which provided high phylogenetic resolution. analyses of the its-dna sequences and its relative  length (short version) allowed species and subspecies differentiation in most cases. the results confirmed the strikingly distant relationship between fusobacterium prausnitzii and the genus fusobacterium. fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, along with fusobacterium naviforme, fusobacterium simiae and fusobacterium periodonticum, formed a cluster with an inherently high potential for diversification. other clusters were formed by fusobacterium necrophorum subspecies with fusobacterium gonidaformans and by fusobacterium varium with fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium ulcerans. fusobacterium russii as well as fusobacterium perfoetens formed separate branches. fusobacterium necrophorum subspp. necrophorum and funduliforme on the one hand, and fusobacterium varium and fusobacterium mortiferum on the other, were found to be very similar, even at the high-resolution its level.

TI  == determination of diamino acids in peptidoglycans from anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == peptidoglycans isolated from two fusobacterium species of anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for constituent amino acids. hydrolysis conditions were varied to optimize the yield of diamino acids from peptidoglycan. the o-phthalaldehyde derivatives of the diamino acid stereoisomers were separated by high-performance  liquid chromatography (opa-hplc), and variations in the relative areas of the two peaks noticed during analysis of solid samples were attributed to sampling errors. co-derivatization/injection experiments using standards of the meso and rac forms separated from commercial mixtures demonstrated that meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid and meso-lanthionine were peptidoglycan components in fusobacterium varium and fusobacterium nucleatum, respectively. the protonated molecules of 2,6-diaminopimelic acid and lanthionine were detected in peptidoglycan hydrolyzates by off-line, flow-injection electrospray mass spectrometry (esi-ms). in esi-ms-ms experiments under identical collision-induced dissociation (cid) conditions, peptidoglycan-derived and standard diamino acids exhibited similar fragmentations. fragmentation pathways are proposed for each diamino acid. the results confirm that the meso forms of two different diamino acids are utilized in the peptidoglycans of fusobacterium species.

TI  == utilization of d-amino acids by fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium varium.
AB  == the utilization of d- and l-amino acids with acidic, basic or polar side chains was demonstrated by hplc. two species of the anaerobe fusobacterium utilized d-lysine and the l isomers of glutamate, glutamine, histidine, lysine and serine. only f. varium used l-arginine, d-glutamate and d-serine as substrates, whereas f. nucleatum specifically utilized d-histidine and d-glutamine. d-glutamate accumulated in f. nucleatum cultures supplemented with d-glutamine, and ornithine was detected when either dl- or l-arginine was included in f. varium cultures. based on literature precedents, d-glutamate and d-histidine are isomerized to their l isomers prior to degradation, but separate catabolic pathways are possible for each enantiomer of lysine and serine.

AB  == the present investigation examined dl-threonine, d-threonine and 2-oxobutyrate conversion into propionate and 2-hydroxybutyrate by various type strains and clinical isolates of fusobacterium. except for fus. naviforme, the type strains were able to produce varying degrees of propionate and/or 2-hydroxybutyrate from  dl-threonine. additionally, d-threonine was converted into an equimolar amount of propionate by fus. necrophorum subsp. necrophorum, fus. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and fus. varium, and to a lower but significant amount by fus. mortiferum and fus. perfoetens. however, the level of propionate remained unchanged for fus. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme, fus. nucleatum subsp. vincentii, fus. naviforme, fus. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme, fus. gonidiaforme and fus.  russii. 2-oxobutyrate was fermented to propionate by all type strains, although fus. russii reduced it mainly to 2-hydroxybutyrate. thus, an attempt was made to  make use of these features in order to identify clinical isolates.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.

TI  == fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  == a total of 243 strains of fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. the strains included 65 (27%) fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) fusobacterium varium, three (1%) fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) fusobacterium gonidiaformans. most fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. these included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. the organisms most commonly isolated with fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. (95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.

TI  == in vitro activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037  against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia  decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == intrageneric relationships of members of the genus fusobacterium as determined by reverse transcriptase sequencing of small-subunit rrna.
AB  == the phylogenetic interrelationships of 14 members of the genus fusobacterium were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the 16s rrna sequences of these organisms. the sequence data revealed considerable intrageneric heterogeneity. the four species fusobacterium nucleatum (including f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, "f. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme," and "f. nucleatum subsp. animalis"), fusobacterium alocis, fusobacterium periodonticum, and fusobacterium simiae, which colonize oral cavities, exhibited high levels of sequence homology with each other and formed a distinct group within the genus. fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium varium,  and fusobacterium ulcerans also formed a phylogenetically coherent group, as did  the two species fusobacterium gonidiaformans and fusobacterium necrophorum. fusobacterium russii and fusobacterium necrogenes displayed no specific relationship with any of the other fusobacteria. the sequence data are discussed  in the context of previous physiological and chemical findings.

TI  == pathways of glutamate catabolism among fusobacterium species.
AB  == glutamate is a major source of energy for fusobacterium species but its mode of catabolism has not hitherto been elucidated. cell suspensions of f. nucleatum and f. varium, as representative species from the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, respectively, both decarboxylated position-labelled glutamate but by different pathways. 14co2 was released only from c-5 by f. nucleatum whereas f. varium decarboxylated glutamate at either c-1 or c-5. in both species, 2 mols of  glutamate fermented yielded 2 mols of acetate and 1 mol of butyrate, suggesting the possibility of three metabolic pathways: the 2-oxoglutarate, mesaconate and 4-aminobutyrate pathways. enzymes representative of the three pathways were assayed for in cell-free extracts of fusobacteria. all species tested possessed high levels of both glutamate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate reductase, indicating the presence of the 2-oxoglutarate pathway. enzymes representative of  the mesaconate pathway were detected in f. sulci, f. ulcerans, f. mortiferum and  f. varium, while the latter two species also possessed the 4-aminobutyrate pathway. the pathways of glutamate catabolism therefore bore no relationship to the site of isolation of the fusobacteria tested but instead correlated with their chemotaxonomic properties. thus, f. varium, f. mortiferum, f. ulcerans and  f. sulci, which possess a peptidoglycan structure based on diaminopimelic acid, have either two or three pathways for glutamate catabolism whereas f. nucleatum and other species that have a lanthionine-based murein metabolized glutamate solely by the 2-oxoglutarate pathway.

TI  == a pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of fusobacteria.
AB  == strains of fusobacteria (143) were examined by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (py-ms) with a horizon instruments pyms 200x. fusobacterium necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum, f. mortiferum, f. varium, f. gonidiaformans, f. naviforme, f. russii and leptotrichia buccalis were discriminated. strains of fusobacteria isolated from tropical ulcers, although similar to f. mortiferum in  conventional tests, were discriminated from each of these species in py-ms. identification of 416 spectra to species level agreed with conventional bacteriological methods in 91.8% of cases, was equivocal in 3.4% and disagreed in 4.8%. classification based on pyrolysis data resolved groups largely corresponding to the recognised species. however, f. nucleatum strains were divided between two distinct groups. the tropical ulcer strains were resolved as  a distinct homogeneous group. py-ms is a rapid, inexpensive and convenient procedure for characterisation of bacteria, with the capacity for a high throughput of samples, although the initial cost of the apparatus is high.

TI  == 5s ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequences in bacteroides and fusobacterium: evolutionary relationships within these genera and among eubacteria in general.
AB  == the 5s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) sequences were determined for bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides capillosus, bacteroides veroralis, porphyromonas gingivalis, anaerorhabdus furcosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium mortiferum, and fusobacterium varium. a dendrogram constructed by a clustering algorithm from these sequences, which were aligned with all other hitherto known eubacterial 5s rrna sequences, showed differences as well as similarities with respect to results derived from 16s rrna analyses. in the 5s rrna dendrogram, bacteroides clustered together with cytophaga and fusobacterium, as in 16s rrna analyses. intraphylum relationships deduced from 5s rrnas suggested that bacteroides is specifically related to cytophaga rather than to fusobacterium, as was suggested by 16s rrna analyses. previous taxonomic considerations concerning the genus bacteroides, based on biochemical and physiological data, were confirmed by the 5s rrna sequence analysis.

TI  == the relationship between fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  == mixed infections with three fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. fifteen fusobacterium isolates (eight f. nucleatum, four f. necrophorum, and three f. varium) and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis, b. asaccharolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before  and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. after co-inoculation  of fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were fusobacterium isolates, while fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than group a streptococci  and e. coli. mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with fusobacterium spp. and k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa or bacteroides spp. suppression of fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with group a streptococci. the additive or synergistic capabilities of fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.

TI  == the pathogenic properties of fusobacterium and bacteroides species from wallabies and other sources.
AB  == intracerebral inoculation was more effective than intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous inoculation as a means of producing lethal infections with fusobacterium necrophorum in mice. strains varied in virulence but, of five examined, two had ld50 values as low as ca. 8000 and 14000 viable organisms. profuse bacterial multiplication in the brain was demonstrated. intravenous vaccination with a single large dose of heat-killed whole culture or washed bacterial cells failed to protect against intracerebral challenge. intracerebral  injection of other fusobacteria (f. nucleatum, f. varium and f. necrogenes) and of 22 strains belonging to 10 bacteroides spp. was without apparent effect on mice, except for a slight transient illness in some animals given b. fragilis. this organism (five strains) differed from the other bacteroides spp. tested, which included eight strains belonging to the fragilis group, in being eliminated more slowly from the mouse brain--a point that may be relevant to the special pathogenicity of b. fragilis in endogenous infections in man. there was no evidence that b. fragilis multiplied in the brain or that intravenous vaccination with a large dose of heat-killed homologous culture affected the rate at which it was eliminated.

TI  == chemical structure of the lipid a component of lipopolysaccharides from fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the lipid a component of lipopolysaccharides from fusobacterium nucleatum fev 1 consists of beta-1',6-linked d-glucosamine disaccharides, which carry two phosphate groups: one in glycosidic and one in ester linkage. the amino groups of the glucosamine disaccharides are substituted by d-3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid. the hydroxyl groups of the disaccharide backbone are acylated by tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic, and d-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acids. part of the ester-bound d-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid is 3-o-substituted by tetradecanoic acid. whereas a similar pattern of fatty acids was detected in lipopolysaccharides from two other f. nucleatum strains, the amide-bound fatty acid in f. varium and f. mortiferum was d-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid. the chemical relationships of lipid a from fusobacteria and other gram-negative bacteria are discussed.

TI  == hemagglutinating activity of fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == gingival isolates of oral fusobacterium nucleatum strains (gram-negative anaerobic fusiform bacilli) have shown the characteristic ability to hemagglutinate a variety of erythrocytes (rbc) of human and animal origin. other  members of the genus tested (f. necrophorus, f. varium, and f. mortiferum) displayed little if any ability to hemagglutinate rbc. the hemagglutination (ha)  activity could be observed in the f. nucleatum strains with the whole cells and in most instances with sonicated preparations of the organisms. the ha activity was observed in cell wall preparations of the organism and appeared dependent upon a heat-labile protein component of the cell wall. in decreasing order, the rbc that would hemagglutinate with the smallest concentration of ha preparations  were rabbit, monkey, human, sheep, horse, and ox. no differences in ha activity of the preparations with cells from the various human blood types were noted. absorption of the ha preparation of one strain with human cells removed ha moiety was bound to the cells via a ca2+ binding site interaction since ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and ethylene glycol-bis-n,n'-tetraacetic acid inhibited binding, and ha could be reestablished by the addition of ca2+ but not  mg2+. rabbit antisera to the f. nucleatum strains inhibited ha activity when tested with the ha preparation in the standard test, whereas anti-leptotrichia buccalis sera or normal rabbit sera had no effect. a tanned-cell passive ha test  with rabbit anti-f. nucleatum sera displayed reactivity between the homologous strains but little reactivity with the other fusobacterium species tested.

TI  == rifampin-blood-agar as a selective medium for the isolation of certain anaerobic  bacteria.
AB  == a selective medium which allows detection of relatively small numbers of fusobacterium varium in fecal specimens is described. blood-agar containing 50 mug of rifampin per ml inhibits the growth of many species of bacteriodes and of  f. fusi-forme/nucleatum but allows good growth of f. varium and most strains of f. mortiferum. quantitative cultures of 11 fecal specimens were done on rifampin  and other selective and nonselective media. f. varium was recovered in counts of  10(6) and 10(7) per gram from two specimens on rifampin only. a third specimen yielded 10(10)f. varium on several media, including rifampin. some eubacterium and clostridium species also grew on rifampin, and these ordinarily were distinguished from the fusobacterium by colony morphology. this medium is of value in fecal flora studies and should be useful with other kinds of specimens where mixtures of organisms are common.
