TI  == preliminary report on anaerobic culture at mymensingh medical college hospital in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal sepsis is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in developing countries. this study was undertaken to isolate and identify the anaerobic bacterial agents of puerperal sepsis among the patients admitted in mymensingh medical college hospital (mmch) during the period from july 2006 to june 2007. endocervical swabs/secretions were collected from 50 cases of puerperal sepsis and were cultured anaerobically. anaerobiasis was done by using  gas pack (bd gas pak tm ez) in anaerobic jar. out of 50 samples, 42(84%) yielded  growth in cultures. among 42 culture positive cases, 20(40%) were aerobic organisms and 22(44%) were mixed, i.e., aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the isolated anaerobic organisms were peptostreptococcus 14(63.63%), bacteroides fragilis 3(13.64%), prevotella melaninogenica 3(13.64%) and clostridium perfringens 2(9.09%). as a preliminary study, it was observed that anaerobic culture could be carried out with available logistic arrangement. so, it was recommended to design further study on anaerobic bacterial isolation with particular emphasis on their antimicrobial susceptibility.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == time-kill study of the activity of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam  against six anaerobes.
AB  == a time-kill method was developed to examine the killing kinetics of trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam against one strain each of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium  mortiferum, peptostreptococcus magnus and clostridium perfringens. solutions and  suspensions were prepared inside an anaerobic glove box, using syringes and prereduced broth. bottles were then incubated outside the chamber and viability counts determined after incubation for 0, 6, 24 and 48 h in a shaking water bath, avoiding introduction of air. bacteriostatic/bactericidal concentrations (mg/l) after 48 h for the six strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.03-1/0.03-1; ciprofloxacin, 0.25-16/0.25-32; sparfloxacin, 0.06-2/0.06-8; metronidazole 1-64/1-64; cefoxitin, 0.125-16/0.125-32; piperacillin, 0.125-64/0.125-64; piperacillin/tazobactam, 0.06-2/0.125-8. bacteriostatic levels were within two dilutions of broth mics. by this time-kill method, trovafloxacin had the lowest bacteriostatic concentrations of all compounds tested.

TI  == comparative efficacy of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and penicillin g against anaerobic bacteria in an animal model.
AB  == treatment efficacy of various antimicrobial regimens against anaerobes was studied in semipermeable chambers simulating a closed-space, locally neutropenic  infection site in rabbits. bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, clostridium perfringens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were inoculated (at a  mean of 5.3 log10 cfu/ml in prereduced pooled rabbit serum) into the chambers (one isolate per chamber) in triplicate. antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole (against the gram-negative anaerobes), or penicillin g (against the gram-positive anaerobes), beginning 4 hours after organism inoculation and continuing every 6 hours for 16 doses. with the use of anaerobic techniques for specimen acquisition, transport, and culture, quantitative bacterial findings were measured at the start of therapy and at various time points thereafter. antibiotic concentrations were measured in blood and chamber fluid by liquid chromatography or bioassay methods. at the end of the study in vivo organisms were reduced by at least 3 log10 cfu/ml from drug-free growth control chambers by all the antimicrobial regimens tested except for cefoperazone against b. fragilis and ciprofloxacin against the three isolates tested. the addition of sulbactam to cefoperazone inhibited b. fragilis beta-lactamase activity and eradicated b. fragilis in vivo. in vivo results with this model confirmed in vitro susceptibilities of all tested antimicrobials except ciprofloxacin and should provide useful indications of the potential clinical efficacy of other new agents against anaerobes.

TI  == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  == bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are predominant anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are common pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses and orofacial infections. clostridium perfringens can cause bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause diarrhea or antibiotic-associated colitis.

TI  == a note on ultra-violet red fluorescence of anaerobic bacteria in vitro.
AB  == anaerobes other than the bacteroides melaninogenicus group isolated from clinical material produce an ultra-violet red fluorescence when grown under certain conditions in vitro. these organisms include other members of the genus bacteroides as well as strains of some species of clostridium, bifidobacterium and actinomyces. the major fluorescent pigment was identified as protoporphyrin ix. factors necessary for the production of fluorescence are the presence of blood or haem and a fermentable carbohydrate during growth on a solid medium. fluorescence intensity was related to the concentration of blood and fermentable  carbohydrate present but was independent of inoculum size. certain commercially available blood agar bases designed specifically for the isolation of fastidious  anaerobes from clinical material which contain added carbohydrate were shown to induce fluorescence in certain organisms. this may lead to the misidentification  of some anaerobes as b. melaninogenicus.

TI  == effect of the growth of anaerobic bacteria on the surface ph of solid media.
AB  == changes in surface ph occurring after varying periods of anaerobic incubation were measured for a total of 23 test solid media. there was little change in the  surface ph of uninoculated plates, but plates inoculated with bacteriodes fragilis showed a striking fall in ph, to ph 5 in the case of some of the test media. the problems of controlling the surface ph of solid media are discussed and possible methods of control are considered.

TI  == the carbon dioxide requirements of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == some clinically significant anaerobic bacteria were incubated in pure culture in  anaerobic jars containing a range of atmospheric concentrations of co2. growth of clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes and c. septicum was independent of the amount of co2. small supplements of co2 (0.25%) allowed good growth of the majority of anaerobes studied--an observation contrary to established teaching. the exceptions were fusobacterium necrophorum which showed an absolute requirement for co2 of at least 1% and b. melaninogenicus which needed an atmospheric content of 10--40% co2 for optimal growth. the inclusion of co2 in the anaerobic jar at a final concentration of 10% is to be recommended for all routine isolation procedures.
