TI  == sodium ion pumps and hydrogen production in glutamate fermenting anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria ferment glutamate via two different pathways to ammonia, carbon dioxide, acetate, butyrate and molecular hydrogen. the coenzyme b12-dependent pathway in clostridium tetanomorphum via 3-methylaspartate involves pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and a novel enzyme, a membrane-bound nadh:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. the flavin- and iron-sulfur-containing enzyme probably uses the energy difference between reduced ferredoxin and nadh to generate an electrochemical na+ gradient, which drives transport processes. the other pathway via 2-hydroxyglutarate in acidaminococcus fermentans and fusobacterium nucleatum involves glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase, which uses the free energy of decarboxylation to generate also an electrochemical na+ gradient.  in the latter two organisms, similar membrane-bound nadh:ferredoxin oxidoreductases have been characterized. we propose that in the hydroxyglutarate  pathway these oxidoreductases work in the reverse direction, whereby the reduction of ferredoxin by nadh is driven by the na+ gradient. the reduced ferredoxin is required for hydrogen production and the activation of radical enzymes. further examples show that reduced ferredoxin is an agent, whose reducing energy is about 1 atp 'richer' than that of nadh.

TI  == dehydration of (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa to enoyl-coa in the fermentation of alpha-amino acids by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == several clostridia and fusobacteria ferment alpha-amino acids via (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa, which is dehydrated to enoyl-coa by syn-elimination. this  reaction is of great mechanistic interest, since the beta-hydrogen, to be eliminated as proton, is not activated (pk 40-50). a mechanism has been proposed, in which one high-energy electron acts as cofactor and transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion. the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive component a, an activator, and component d, the actual dehydratase. component a, a homodimer with one [4fe-4s]cluster, transfers an electron to component d, a heterodimer with 1-2 [4fe-4s]clusters and fmn, concomitant with hydrolysis of two atp. from component d the electron is further  transferred to the substrate, where it facilitates elimination of the hydroxyl group. in the resulting enoxyradical the beta-hydrogen is activated (pk14). after elimination the electron is handed-over to the next incoming substrate without further hydrolysis of atp. the helix-cluster-helix architecture of component a forms an angle of 105 degrees, which probably opens to 180 degrees upon binding of atp resembling an archer shooting arrows. therefore we designated component a  as 'archerase'. here, we describe 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from acidaminococcus fermentans, clostridium symbiosum and fusobacterium nucleatum, 2-phenyllactate dehydratase from clostridium sporogenes, 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa  dehydratase from clostridium difficile, and lactyl-coa dehydratase from clostridium propionicum. a relative of the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases is benzoyl-coa reductase from thauera aromatica. analogous but unrelated archerases  are the iron proteins of nitrogenase and bacterial protochlorophyllide reductase. in anaerobic organisms, which do not oxidize 2-oxo acids, a second energy-driven  electron transfer from nadh to ferredoxin, the electron donor of component a, has been established. the transfer is catalysed by a membrane-bound nadh-ferredoxin oxidoreductase driven by an electrochemical na(+)-gradient. this enzyme is related to the rnf proteins involved in rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogen fixation.

TI  == 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from clostridium symbiosum.
AB  == component d (hgdab) of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from clostridium symbiosum was purified to homogeneity. it is able to use component a from acidaminococcus fermentans (hgdc) to initiate catalysis together with atp, mg2+ and a strong reducing agent such as ti(iii)citrate. component d from c. symbiosum has a 6 x higher specific activity compared with that from a. fermentans and contains a second [4fe-4s] cluster but the same amount of riboflavin 5'-phosphate (1.0 per heterodimeric enzyme, m = 100 kda). mossbauer spectroscopy revealed symmetric cube-type structures of the two [4fe-4s]2+ clusters. epr spectroscopy showed the resistance of the clusters to reducing agents, but detected a sharp signal at g = 2. 004 probably due to a stabilized flavin semiquinone. three genes from c. symbiosum coding for components d (hgda and hgdb) and a (hgdc) were cloned and sequenced. primer extension experiments indicated that the genes are transcribed in the order hgdcab from an operon only half the size of that from a. fermentans. sequence comparisons detected a close relationship to the dehydratase system from a. fermentans and hgda from fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as to putative proteins of unknown function from archaeoglobus fulgidus. lower, but significant, identities were found with putative enzymes from several methanogenic archaea and escherichia coli, as well as with the mechanistically related benzoyl-coa reductases from the proteobacteria rhodopseudomonas palustris and thauera aromatica.

TI  == 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from fusobacterium nucleatum (subsp. nucleatum): an iron-sulfur flavoprotein.
AB  == anaerobically prepared cell-free extracts from fusobacterium nucleatum contain 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase with a specific activity of 20 nkat mg-1. the enzyme was purified 24-fold to a specific activity of 480 nkat mg-1 by anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration and chromatography on blue-sepharose. the activity of the purified enzyme was strictly dependent on the reductant ti(iii)citrate and stimulated 25-fold by 0.15 mm atp and 5 mm mgcl2. atp is hydrolysed to adp during incubation with 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase in the presence or absence of the substrate. the enzyme is extremely sensitive towards oxygen and is inhibited by 10 microm chloramphenicol, 10 microm 2,4-dinitrophenol or 0.15 mm hydroxylamine. the pure enzyme consists of three subunits alpha (49 kda), beta (39 kda) and gamma (24 kda) in approximately equal amounts. in this respect the enzyme differs from the related 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from acidaminococcus fermentans and lactyl-coa dehydratase from clostridium propionicum both of which are composed of only two subunits with sizes comparable to those of alpha and beta but require an additional protein for activity. the relative molecular mass of the native enzyme of about 100 kda suggests a trimeric alpha beta gamma-structure. the homogeneous enzyme contains riboflavin (0.5 mol/112 kda), iron and sulfur (3.5 mol/112 kda each). polyclonal antibodies directed against the 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from a. fermentans did not crossreact with cell free extracts or purified dehydratase from f. nucleatum. a comparison of the n-terminal amino acid sequences of the dehydratase subunits from a. fermentans and f. nucleatum, however, showed some similarities in the beta-subunits.

TI  == the biotin-dependent sodium ion pump glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase from fusobacterium nucleatum (subsp. nucleatum). comparison with the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == membrane preparations of fusobacterium nucleatum grown on glutamate contain glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase at a high specific activity (13.8 nkat/mg protein).  the enzyme was solubilized with 2% triton x-100 in 0.5 m nacl and purified 63-fold to a specific activity of 870 nkat/mg by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin-sepharose. the activity of the decarboxylase was strictly dependent on na+ (km = 3 mm) and was stimulated up to 3-fold by phospholipids. the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria acidaminococcus fermentans and clostridium symbiosum have a lower apparent km for na+ (1 mm) and  were not stimulated by phospholipids. in addition only the fusobacterial decarboxylase required sodium ion for stability and was inactivated by potassium  ion. by incorporation of this purified enzyme into phospholipids an electrogenic  sodium ion pump was reconstituted. the enzyme consists of four subunits, alpha (m = 65 kda), beta (33 kda), gamma (19 kda), and delta (16 kda) with the functions of a carboxy transferase (alpha), a carboxy lyase (beta and probably delta) and a biotin carrier (gamma). the subunits are very similar to those of the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria. with an antiserum  directed against the decarboxylase from a. fermentans the alpha- and the biotin containing subunits of the three decarboxylases and that from peptostreptococcus  asaccharolyticus could be detected on western blots.

TI  == two pathways of glutamate fermentation by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == two pathways are involved in the fermentation of glutamate to acetate, butyrate,  carbon dioxide, and ammonia-the methylaspartate and the hydroxyglutarate pathways which are used by clostridium tetanomorphum and peptococcus aerogenes, respectively. although these pathways give rise to the same products, they are easily distinguished by different labeling patterns of the butyrate when [4-(14)c]glutamate is used as substrate. schmidt degradation of the radioactive butyrate from c. tetanomorphum yielded equally labeled propionate and carbon dioxide, whereas nearly all the radioactivity of the butyrate from p. aerogenes was recovered in the corresponding propionate. this procedure was used as a test  for the pathway of glutamate fermentation by 15 strains (9 species) of anaerobic  bacteria. the labeling patterns of the butyrate indicate that glutamate is fermented via the methylaspartate pathway by c. tetani, c. cochlearium, and c. saccarobutyricum, and via the hydroxyglutarate pathway by acidaminococcus fermentans, c. microsporum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and f. fusiformis. enzymes specific for each pathway were assayed in crude extracts of the above organisms.  3-methylaspartase was found only in clostridia which use the methylaspartate pathway, including clostridium sb4 and c. sticklandii, which probably degrade glutamate to acetate and carbon dioxide by using a second amino acid as hydrogen  acceptor. high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase were found exclusively  in organisms that use the hydroxyglutarate pathway. the data indicate that only two pathways are involved in the fermentation of glutamate by the bacteria analyzed. the methylaspartate pathway appears to be used only by species of clostridium, whereas the hydroxyglutarate pathway is used by representatives of several genera.
