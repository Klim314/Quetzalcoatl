TI  == exploring the oral microbiota of children at various developmental stages of their dentition in the relation to their oral health.
AB  == background: an understanding of the relation of commensal microbiota to health is essential in preventing disease. here we studied the oral microbial composition of children (n = 74, aged 3 - 18 years) in natural transition from their deciduous to a permanent dentition and related the microbial profiles to their oral health status. the microbial composition of saliva was assessed by barcoded  pyrosequencing of the v5-v6 hypervariable regions of the 16 s rrna, as well as by using phylogenetic microarrays. results: pyrosequencing reads (126174 reads, 1045 unique sequences) represented 8 phyla and 113 higher taxa in saliva samples. four phyla--firmicutes, bacteriodetes, proteobacteria and actinobacteria--predominated in all groups. the deciduous dentition harboured a higher proportion of proteobacteria (gammaproteobacteria, moraxellaceae) than bacteroidetes, while in  all other groups bacteroidetes were at least as abundant as proteobacteria. bacteroidetes (mainly genus prevotella), veillonellaceae family, spirochaetes and candidate division tm7 increased with increasing age, reflecting maturation of the microbiome driven by biological changes with age. microarray analysis enabled further analysis of the individual salivary microbiota. of 350 microarray probes, 156 gave a positive signal with, on average, 77 (range 48-93) probes per individual sample. a caries-free oral status significantly associated with the higher signal of the probes targeting porphyromonas catoniae and neisseria flavescens. conclusions: the potential role of p. catoniae and n. flavescens as oral health markers should be assessed in large-scale clinical studies. the combination of both open-ended and targeted molecular approaches provides us with information that will increase our understanding of the interplay between the human host and its microbiome.
