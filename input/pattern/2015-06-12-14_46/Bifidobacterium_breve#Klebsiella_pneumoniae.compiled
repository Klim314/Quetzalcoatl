TI  - Assessment of intestinal microbiota modulation ability of Bifidobacterium strains in in vitro fecal batch cultures from preterm neonates.
AB  - Microbial colonization of the infant gut is essential for the development of the  intestine and the immune system. The intestinal microbiota of full-term breast-fed infants is considered as the health standard for newborns. A culture medium containing formula milk was designed, which allowed a balanced growth of intestinal microorganisms and was used to perform fecal batch cultures from preterm babies. Sixteen Bifidobacterium strains and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) were tested for their ability to modulate in vitro the intestinal microbiota. The production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) was measured by Gas Chromatography and the levels of some anaerobe (Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides groups) and facultative anaerobes (Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, Weissella group, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were determined by quantitative PCR. Results were referred to a fecal negative control culture without microorganisms or FOS added. Strains that in fecal cultures counteracted better the aberrancies previously found in feces of preterm babies, as compared with full-term breast-fed infants, were selected. The three Bifidobacterium bifidum strains tested in this work promoted the most suitable shifts in SCFA and in the ratio of variables facultative anaerobes to anaerobes. Two Bifidobacterium breve strains complied with the requirement for facultative anaerobes and anaerobes and one of them also promoted a suitable shift of SCFA. Bifidobacteria behaved similarly as FOS regarding the microbial profiles in fecal cultures but the production of lactic and acetic acid was much lower. B. breve and B. bifidum strains selected represent promising candidates for their assessment in more complex in vitro and in vivo models.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
