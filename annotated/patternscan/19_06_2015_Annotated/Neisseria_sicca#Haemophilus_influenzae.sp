TI  == neisseria gonorrhoeae filamentous phage ngophi6 is capable of infecting a variety of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we constructed a phagemid consisting of the whole genome of the neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteriophage ngophi6 cloned into a pbluescript plasmid derivative lacking the f1 origin of replication (named pbs::phi6). escherichia coli cells harboring pbs::phi6 were able to produce a biologically active phagemid, ngophi6fm, capable of infecting, integrating its dna into the chromosome of, and  producing progeny phagemids in, a variety of taxonomically distant gram-negative  bacteria, including e. coli, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria sicca, pseudomonas sp., and paracoccus methylutens. a derivative of pbs::phi6 lacking the phage orf7 gene, a positional homolog of filamentous phage proteins that mediate the interaction between the phage and the bacterial pilus, was capable of producing phagemid particles that were able to infect e. coli, haemophilus influenzae, n. sicca, pseudomonas sp., and paracoccus methylutens, indicating that ngophi6 infects cells of these species using a mechanism that does not involve the orf7 gene product and that ngophi6 initiates infection through a novel process in these species. we further demonstrate that the establishment of the lysogenic state does not require an active phage integrase. since phagemid particles were capable of infecting diverse hosts, this indicates that ngophi6 is the first broad-host-range filamentous bacteriophage described.

TI  == assessment of the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of rhesus macaques: moraxella, neisseria, haemophilus, and other genera.
AB  == the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of healthy rhesus macaques was surveyed for the presence of neisseria and haemophilus species, as well as moraxella catarrhalis. m. catarrhalis was found both in healthy rhesus macaques and in possibly immunocompromised rhesus macaques. several haemophilus spp. that are part of the normal nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of humans were found in many animals; these haemophilus species included h. parahaemolyticus, h. segnis, and h. parainfluenzae. while haemophilus influenzae was not identified, it is possible that the identification of h. influenzae types may have been thwarted by the growth of less fastidious species. a number of animals harbored neisseria spp. such as n. sicca. however, neisseria meningitidis was not found. in summary, it appears as though the rhesus macaque may be used as a model for m. catarrhalis infections. moreover, in view of the susceptibility of macaques to organisms of the haemophilus and neisseria genera, it is possible that these animals may also  accurately model nontypeable h. influenzae and n. meningitidis infections.

TI  == identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical acinetobacter junii and neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  == the mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of acinetobacter junii and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. these strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria perflava/sicca and neisseria mucosa and gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. three streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae, kingella denitrificans, m. catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, n. perflava/sicca, and n. mucosa at similar frequencies. the mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.

TI  == ciprofloxacin versus cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial sinusitis.
AB  == objective: this study compared the use and efficacy of ciprofloxacin to cefuroxime axetil for adult patients with acute bacterial sinusitis. method: we conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study of oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) versus cefuroxime axetil (250 mg twice daily)  for 2 to 3 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of  acute bacterial maxillary sinus infections or acute exacerbation of chronic bacterial sinusitis. patients with microbiologically and radiologically confirmed sinusitis infection composed the efficacy population. results: of the 83 patients enrolled, 13 of 42 (31%) ciprofloxacin- and 19 of 41 (46%) cefuroxime axetil-treated patients had a respiratory pathogen isolated from a sinus aspiration. the most frequent pretherapy isolated included haemophilus influenzae (11), streptococcus species (20), staphylococcus species (7), proteus mirabilis (3), and neisseria sicca (3). at the end of therapy, clinical resolution or improvement in efficacy-valid patients was achieved in 12 (100%) ciprofloxacin-treated patients and in 14 (74%) cefuroxime axetil recipients. the  five (26%) cefuroxime axetil clinical failures were due to development of superinfection. bacteriologic eradication occurred in 12 (100%) and 14 (100%) ciprofloxacin and cefuroxime axetil patients, respectively. similar clinical and  bacteriologic response rates were observed at the 2- to 4-week follow-up. among 83 intent-to-treat patients, 19 (45%) ciprofloxacin and 14 (34%) cefuroxime axetil patients had drug-related adverse events. the most common adverse event in both treatment groups was gastrointestinal. conclusion: this pilot study suggests that ciprofloxacin is efficacious in the management of acute bacterial sinusitis.

TI  == investigations into the molecular basis of meningococcal toxicity for human endothelial and epithelial cells: the synergistic effect of lps and pili.
AB  == using human umbilical vein endothelial cells as an in vitro model of toxicity, it was found that neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria lactamica and neisseria sicca caused damage to these cells, in contrast to the lack of cytotoxicity exhibited by haemophilus influenzae type b. n. meningitidis was also found to be toxic for human epithelial cells. the major toxic factor of n. meningitidis was found to be a heat-stable component of outer membrane vesicles,  and could be inhibited by polymyxin b, suggesting that lipopolysaccharide plays a major role in toxicity. however, the toxicity mediated by lipopolysaccharide was  modulated significantly by pilus-dependent adherence. intra-strain variants expressing altered pilins which exhibited different levels of adherence to epithelial and endothelial cells were used to study the role of pilus. the degree of toxicity observed correlated with their relative level of adherence to cultured cells. in contrast, opc-dependent increased adherence did not result in  increased toxicity for endothelial cells, suggesting that pili have a synergistic effect, contributing to the overall damage.

TI  == detection of the tetm determinant in neisseria gonorrhoeae using a non-radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe.
AB  == three oligonucleotide probes, complementary to tetm sequences, were labelled non-radiometrically using the dig-oligonucleotide tailing kit and evaluated for their specificity for the detection of plasmid mediated tetracycline resistance in neisseria gonorrhoeae. only probe 3, 5'-gct caa caa ttc tgt tcc agc-3', was specific for tetm. it hybridized with the tetm-containing 25.2-mda plasmids from  all of the 232 trng and the 130 pp/trng isolates used in the study. its sensitivity, determined by dot-blot hybridization, was 0.1 pg of pj13 plasmid dna or 10(4) cells. it did not hybridize with the dna from non-ppng, cmrng and tetracycline susceptible isolates from seven other neisseria species (n. meningitidis, n. subflava, n. cinerea, n. lactamica, n. sicca, n. mucosa, and n.  flavescens), moraxella spp. and haemophilus influenzae. probe 3 also hybridized to dna of three tetracycline resistant p. magnus (mic = 16 micrograms ml-1) isolates which presumptively carried the tetm determinant. therefore, probe 3 can be used by reference laboratories as a confirmatory test for trng, as well as isolates from other genera containing the tetm determinant.
