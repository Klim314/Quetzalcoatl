fresh garlic extract enhances the antimicrobial activities of antibiotics on resistant strains in vitro.
background: infections caused by strains with multi-drug resistance are difficult to treat with standard antibiotics. garlic is a powerful remedy to protect against infections of many bacteria, fungi and viruses. however, little is known about the potentials of fresh garlic extract (fge) to improve the sensitivity of multi-drug resistant strains to antibiotics. objectives: in this study, we used the disk diffusion method to investigate the antimicrobial activities of fge and the combination of antibiotics with fge, on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, to evaluate the interactions between antibiotics and fge. materials and methods: clinical isolates were isolated from clinical specimens obtained from the inpatients at the first affiliated hospital of xi'an jiaotong university health science center. the isolates consisted of mrsa, (n = 30), c. albicans (n = 30) and p. aeruginosa (n = 30). quality control for clsi (clinical and laboratory standards institute) disk diffusion was performed using s. aureus atcc(r)25923, c. albicans atcc(r)90028 and p. aeruginosa atcc(r)27853. the 93 microorganisms were divided into four groups in a factorial design: control (deionized water), fge, antibiotics without fge, and antibiotics with fge. next, antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring the diameter of inhibition zones according to performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi, formerly nccls). results: fresh garlic extract displayed evident inhibition properties against c. albicans and mrsa, yet weak inhibition properties against p. aeruginosa. additionally, fge showed the potential to improve the effect of antibiotics on antibiotic resistant pathogens. the synergism of fluconazole and itraconazole with fge on c. albicans yielded larger sized inhibition zones compared with fluconazole and itraconazole without fge (p < 0.01). the factorial analysis represents intense positive interaction effects (p < 0.01). the synergism of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone with fge on p. aeruginosa yielded larger sized inhibition zones than cefotaxime and ceftriaxone without fge (p < 0.01). the factorial analysis represents intense positive interaction effects (p < 0.01). conclusions: the results suggest that fge can improve the antibiotic sensitivity of these pathogens to some antibiotics.
sertraline enhances the activity of antimicrobial agents against pathogens of clinical relevance.
background: serotonin reuptake inhibitors were recently reported to possess antimicrobial potentials, potentiate activity of several antibiotics, reverse multidrug resistant phenotypes of bacteria and make them susceptible to previously resistant drugs. we investigated antimicrobial potentials of sertraline (sr) against atcc strains, clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa alone and in-combination with seven antibiotics. antifungal activity was investigated against four fungal strains including aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus flavus, and fusarium solani. intrinsic antibacterial action and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using well assay, nutrient broth and agar dilution techniques. disk diffusion and nutrient broth methods were used to study bacterial susceptibility to sr. minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) of sr were determined using sabouraud dextrose agar (sda). results: sertraline possesses strong intrinsic antibacterial, antifungal activities and has augmented the antibacterial activities of antibiotics. for s. aureus atcc 6538, e. coli atcc 8739 and p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, the mics of sr were 20, 40 and 60 mug ml(-1), respectively, whereas 55.5% clinical isolates of s. aureus and 50% of e. coli strains were inhibited at 20 and 60 mug ml(-1) of sr, respectively. among the tested fungi, 60% of a. niger and a. fumigatus were inhibited at 40 and 80 mug ml(-1), respectively. mfcs were 60 and 80 mug ml(-1) for a. flavus and f. solani, respectively. antibacterial activities of all antibiotics were significantly increased (p < 0.001) with the addition of sr 100 mug ml(-1) against all tested bacteria. conclusion: combination study revealed that sr had significantly increased the activity of antibiotics, and some previously resistant strains were made susceptible. thus antidepressants are potential sources of resistance modifying agents when used in combination.
statins and antimicrobial effects: simvastatin as a potential drug against staphylococcus aureus biofilm.
statins are important lipid-lowering agents with other pleiotropic effects. several studies have explored a possible protective effect of statins to reduce the morbidity and mortality of many infectious diseases. staphylococcus aureus is one of the main pathogens implicated in nosocomial infections; its ability to form biofilms makes treatment difficult. the present study observed the mic of atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin against s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. simvastatin was the only agent with activity against clinical isolates and reference strains of methicilin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). thus, the effects of simvastatin on the growth, viability and biofilm formation of s. aureus were tested. in addition, a possible synergistic effect between simvastatin and vancomycin was evaluated. simvastatin's mic was 15.65 microg/ml for s. aureus 29213 and 31.25 microg/ml for the other strains of s. aureus. the effect of simvastatin was bactericidal at 4xmic and bacteriostatic at the mic concentration. no synergistic effect was found between simvastatin and vancomycin. however, the results obtained against s. aureus biofilms showed that, in addition to inhibiting adhesion and biofilm formation at concentrations from 1/16xmic to 4xmic, simvastatin was also able to act against mature biofilms, reducing cell viability and extra-polysaccharide production. in conclusion, simvastatin showed pronounced antimicrobial activity against s. aureus biofilms, reducing their formation and viability.
[deceleration of bacterial growth in staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures in the presence of copper and zinc cations].
aim: evaluate antibacterial effects of millimole concentrations of copper and zinc cations used as sulfates or chlorides in s. aureus and p. aeruginosa cultures. materials and methods: suspension of s. aureus or p. aeruginosa containing 108 cfu/ml were lawn-seeded onto petri dishes with nutrient agar. 30 minutes later salt solution of copper or zinc with concentrations by metal cation from 10(-9) or 10(-6) m to 5 x 10(-1) m were applied to the surface of the lawn by 5 mu drops using a 36-channel stamp-replicator. dishes with bacterial cultures were then incubated for 16-18 hours at 37 degrees c, and diameter of growth inhibition zone was measured afterwards. for evaluation of the presence (absence) ofviable bacteria in growth inhibition zones, seeding of the material from the center of the zone was carried out into tubes with nutrient broth that were thermostated up to 5 days at 37 degrees c, clarity of the nutrient broth was then evaluated. results: inhibiting effects of zinc sulfate against s. aureus surpass effects of copper sulfate by 1.3-1.6 times (p < 0.001-0.05) within metal concentrations from 50 to 500 mm. the effects of zinc chloride in s. aureus culture surpass effects of copper chloride by 1.2-1.6 times (p < 0.02) for cation concentrations of 100 and 500 mm. in p. aeruginosa cultures, antibacterial effects of copper sulfate are comparable with effects of zinc sulfate. the effects of copper chloride on p. aeruginosa cells are 1.2 times more pronounced (p < 0.05) than effects of zinc chloride for metal concentration of 500 mm. material seeding from zones of culture growth suppression detects turbidity of nutrient broth in samples with specimens from wells treated with zinc salts and broth clarity in samples from wells treated with copper salts. conclusion: in millimole con- centrations, copper and zinc cations have pronounced antibacterial effects in cultures of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. it is realized as bactericidal in the presence of copper cations and bacteriostatic - in the presence of zinc cations. s. aureus bacteria turn out to be more sensitive to the effects of zinc cations, evaluated by zones of growth inhibition, than p. aeruginosa. the latter show a higher, than s. aureus, tolerance to copper and zinc. wherein, p. aeruginosa toler- ance to copper cations is surmountable.
anti-biofilm activity of low-amperage continuous and intermittent direct electrical current.
bacterial biofilms are difficult to treat using available antimicrobial agents, so new anti-biofilm strategies are needed. we previously showed that 20, 200, and 2000mua of electrical current reduced bacterial biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. here, we tested continuous direct current at lower amperages, intermittent direct current, and combinations of surface materials (teflon or titanium) and electrode compositions (stainless steel, graphite, titanium or platinum) against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and p. aeruginosa biofilms. in addition, we tested 200 or 2000mua for 1 and 4 days against biofilms of 33 strains representing 13 species of microorganisms. the logarithmic reduction factor (lrf) was used to measure treatment effects. using continuous current delivery, the lowest active amperage was 2mua for 1, 4 or 7 days against p. aeruginosa, and 5mua for 7 days against s. epidermidis and s. aureus biofilms. delivery of 200mua for 4 hours a day over 4 days reduced p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis biofilms on teflon or titanium discs. a reduction of p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis biofilms was measured for 23 of 24 combinations of surface materials and electrode compositions tested. four days of direct current delivery reduced biofilms of 25 of 33 strains studied. in conclusion, low-amperage current or 4 hours a day of intermittent current delivered using a variety of electrode compositions reduced p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis biofilms on a variety of surface materials. the electricidal effect was observed against a majority of bacterial species studied.
pegylated ofloxacin nanoparticles render strong antibacterial activity against many clinically important human pathogens.
the rise of bacterial resistance against important drugs threatens their clinical utility. fluoroquinones, one of the most important classes of contemporary antibiotics has also reported to suffer bacterial resistance. since the general mechanism of bacterial resistance against fluoroquinone antibiotics (e.g. ofloxacin) consists of target mutations resulting in reduced membrane permeability and increased efflux by the bacteria, strategies that could increase bacterial uptake and reduce efflux of the drug would provide effective treatment. in the present study, we have compared the efficiencies of ofloxacin delivered in the form of free drug (ofx) and as nanoparticles on bacterial uptake and antibacterial activity. although both poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (ofx-plga) and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (ofx-mpeg-plga) nanoformulations presented improved bacterial uptake and antibacterial activity against all the tested human bacterial pathogens, namely, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus, ofx-mpeg-plga showed significantly higher bacterial uptake and antibacterial activity compared to ofx-plga. we have also found that mpeg-plga nanoencapsulation could significantly inhibit bacillus subtilis resistance development against ofx.
influenza-induced type i interferon enhances susceptibility to gram-negative and  gram-positive bacterial pneumonia in mice.
suppression of type 17 immunity by type i interferon (ifn) during influenza a infection has been shown to enhance susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia. while this mechanism has been described in coinfection with gram-positive bacteria, it is unclear if similar mechanisms may impair lung defense against gram-negative infections. furthermore, precise delineation of the duration of type i ifn-associated susceptibility to bacterial infection remains underexplored. therefore, we investigated the effects of preceding influenza a virus infection on subsequent challenge with the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the temporal association between ifn expression with susceptibility to staphylococcus aureus challenge in a mouse model of influenza and bacterial coinfection. here, we demonstrate that preceding influenza a virus led to increased lung e. coli and p. aeruginosa bacterial burden, which was associated with suppression of type 17 immunity and attenuation of antimicrobial peptide expression. enhanced susceptibility to s. aureus coinfection ceased at day 14 of influenza infection, when influenza-associated type i ifn levels had returned to baseline levels, further suggesting a key role for type i ifn in coinfection pathogenesis. these findings further implicate type i ifn-associated suppression of type 17 immunity and antimicrobial peptide production as a conserved mechanism for enhanced susceptibility to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial coinfection during influenza infection.
antimicrobial activity of eucalyptus globulus oil, xylitol and papain: a pilot study.
objective to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the eucalyptus globulus essential oil, and of the xylitol and papain substances against the following microorganisms: pseudomonas aeruginosa; samonella sp.; staphylococus aureus; proteus vulgaris; escherichia coli and candida albicans. method the in vitro antimicrobial evaluation was used by means of the agar diffusion test and evaluation of the inhibition zone diameter of the tested substances. chlorhexidine 0.5% was used as control. results the eucalyptus globulus oil showed higher inhibition than chlorhexidine when applied to staphylococcus aureus, and equal inhibition when applied to the following microorganisms: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and candida albicans. papain 10% showed lower antimicrobial effect than chlorhexidine in relation to candida albicans. xylitol showed no inhibition of the tested microorganisms. conclusion the eucalyptus globulus oil has antimicrobial activity against different microorganisms and appears to be a viable alternative as germicidal agent hence, further investigation is recommended.

antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of portuguese foeniculum vulgare fruits.
the aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the centre and south of portugal. composition of essential oils was established by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (gc-fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis. the obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. a total of 16 compounds were identified. the main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). the percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: aspergillus niger, a. japonicus, a. oryzae, fusarium oxysporum, rhizophus oryzae and r. stolonifer. antibacterial activity was assessed against three gram-positive strains: enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228 and s. aureus atcc 28213; and against six gram-negative strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922; morganella morganii lfg 08; proteus mirabilis lfg 04; salmonella enteritidis lfg 05; s. entiritidis serovar typhimurium lfg 06 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. the mic values varied from 62.5 (e. coli atcc 25922) to 2000 microml (p. aeruginosa atcc 27853).
polyamine derivatives of betulinic acid and beta-sitosterol: a comparative investigation.
beta-sitosterol and betulinic acid were used in designing their conjugates with selected polyamines bearing either an amide bond, or an ester and an amide bond simultaneously in the target molecule. the synthesized compounds were subjected to basic cytotoxic and antimicrobial tests. the synthetic protocol is described separately for each of the three series of the target amides, because each series of compounds required a different synthetic approach. the cytotoxicity was tested on cells derived from human t-lymphoblastic leukemia, breast adenocarcinoma and cervical cancer, and compared with the tests on normal human fibroblasts. most of the target compounds (5a-5c, 11a-11c and 16a-16c) showed medium to high cytotoxicity (0.7-7.8mum), however, in some cases the compounds showed high cytotoxicity even toward normal human fibroblasts (11a-11c). two compounds of this series (11c and 16c) also displayed antimicrobial activity with high and selective microbe specificity. the compound 11c was potent against escherichia coli (minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 6.25mugml(-1), i.e. 9.75nmml(-1)) and staphylococcus aureus (mic 12.5mugml(-1), i.e. 19.5nmml(-1)), and showed medium activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the compound 16c was highly active against enterococcus faecalis and s. aureus (both, mic 3.125mugml(-1), i.e. 4.22nmml(-1)), both gram-positive bacteria, however showed only weak activity against e. coli and no activity against p. aeruginosa, both gram-negative bacteria, which indicates possible microbe specificity of 16c. comparing beta-sitosterol-based series (5a-5c) and betulinic acid series (11a-11c and 16a-16c) of the target compounds, the latter one gave more promising structures. the compounds 11c and 16c showed effects which may be described as multifarious activity (pleiotropic effects).
bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) against  the eskape pathogens.
the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. the 'eskape' pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) have been highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. the stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. this study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed apntp jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the eskape pathogens. standard plate counts and the xtt metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of apntp, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. apntp exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the eskape pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and complete eradication of eskape pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of a. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. this demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
repurposing non-antimicrobial drugs and clinical molecules to treat bacterial infections.
there is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. the objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. a library, containing 727 fda approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobactercloacae). drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. the initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolates. two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against gram-negative pathogens. among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (eb) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (fdurd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant staphylococcus isolates including mrsa, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa), and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa).the minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of s. aureus were inhibited (mic90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/l for eb and fdurd, respectively. treatment with eb orally significantly increased mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic mrsa-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. fdurd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. these data encourage screening and repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
blue laser inhibits bacterial growth of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli,  and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
objective: the purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of blue laser on bacterial growth of the main species that usually colonize cutaneous ulcers, as well as its effect over time following irradiation. background data: the use of blue laser has been described as an adjuvant therapeutic method to inhibit bacterial growth, but there is no consensus about the best parameters to be used. methods: strains of staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and escherichia coli atcc 25922 were suspended in saline solution at a concentration of 1.5x10(3) colony forming units (cfu)/ml. next, 300 mul of this suspension was transferred to a microtitulation plate and exposed to a single blue laser irradiation (450 nm) at fluences of 0 (control), 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 j/cm(2). each suspension was spread over the surface of a petri plate before being incubated at 37 degrees c, and counts of cfu were determined after 24 and 48 h. results: blue laser inhibited the growth of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa at fluences >6 j/cm(2). on the other hand, e. coli was inhibited at all fluences tested, except at 24 j/cm(2). conclusions: blue laser light was capable of inhibiting bacterial growth at low fluences over time, thus presenting no time-dependent effect.
metabolic pathways of pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in competition with respiratory bacterial pathogens.
background: chronic airway infection by pseudomonas aeruginosa considerably contributes to lung tissue destruction and impairment of pulmonary function in cystic-fibrosis (cf) patients. complex interplays between p. aeruginosa and other co-colonizing pathogens including staphylococcus aureus, burkholderia sp., and klebsiella pneumoniae may be crucial for pathogenesis and disease progression. methods: we generated a library of pa14 transposon insertion mutants to identify p. aeruginosa genes required for exploitative and direct competitions with s. aureus, burkholderia cenocepacia, and k. pneumoniae. results: whereas wild-type pa14 inhibited s. aureus growth, two transposon insertions located in pqsc and carb, resulted in reduced growth inhibition. pqsc is involved in the synthesis of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (haqs), a family of molecules having antibacterial properties, while carb is a key gene in pyrimidine biosynthesis. the carb mutant was also unable to grow in the presence of b. cepacia and k. pneumoniae but not escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. we further identified a transposon insertion in purf, encoding a key enzyme of purine metabolism. this mutant displayed a severe growth deficiency in the presence of gram-negative but not of gram-positive bacteria. we identified a beneficial interaction in a bioa transposon mutant, unable to grow on rich medium. this growth defect could be restored either by addition of biotin or by co-culturing the mutant in the presence of k. pneumoniae or e. coli. conclusion: complex interactions take place between the various bacterial species colonizing cf-lungs. this work identified both detrimental and beneficial interactions occurring between p. aeruginosa and three other respiratory pathogens involving several major metabolic pathways. manipulating these pathways could be used to interfere with bacterial interactions and influence the colonization by respiratory pathogens.
iron depletion enhances production of antimicrobials by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
cystic fibrosis (cf) is a heritable disease characterized by chronic, polymicrobial lung infections. while staphylococcus aureus is the dominant lung pathogen in young cf patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa becomes predominant by adulthood. p. aeruginosa produces a variety of antimicrobials that likely contribute to this shift in microbial populations. in particular, secretion of 2-alkyl-4(1h)-quinolones (aqs) contributes to lysis of s. aureus in co-culture, providing an iron source to p. aeruginosa both in vitro and in vivo. we previously showed that production of one such aq, the pseudomonas quinolone signal (pqs), is enhanced by iron depletion, and that this induction is dependent upon the iron-responsive prrf srnas. here we demonstrate that antimicrobial activity against s. aureus during co-culture is also enhanced by iron depletion, and we provide evidence that multiple aqs contribute to this activity. strikingly, a p. aeruginosa deltaprrf mutant, which produces very little pqs in mono-culture, was capable of mediating iron-regulated growth suppression of s. aureus. we show that the presence of s. aureus suppresses the deltaprrf1,2 mutant's defect in iron-regulated pqs production, indicating a prrf-independent iron regulatory pathway mediates aq production in co-culture. we further demonstrate that iron-regulated antimicrobial production is conserved in multiple p. aeruginosa strains, including clinical isolates from cf patients. these results demonstrate that iron plays a central role in modulating interactions of p. aeruginosa with s. aureus. moreover, our studies suggest that established iron regulatory pathways of these pathogens are significantly altered during polymicrobial infections. importance: chronic polymicrobial infections involving p. aeruginosa and s. aureus are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, as the interplay between these two organisms exacerbates infection. this is in part due to enhanced production of antimicrobial metabolites by p. aeruginosa when these two species are co-cultured. using both established and newly developed co-culture techniques, this report demonstrates that iron depletion increases p. aeruginosa's ability to suppress growth of s. aureus. these findings present a novel role for iron in modulating microbial interaction, and provide the basis for understanding how essential nutrients drive polymicrobial infections.
repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic): 0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.
in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy associated with hydroalcoholic extracts of schinopsis brasiliensis engl.: new therapeutic perspectives.
objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the photodynamic potential of extracts of schinopsis brasiliensis engl. on bacteria involved in several human infections. background data: photodynamic therapy (pdt) involves the interaction of light with an appropriate and photosensitizer wavelength, and the prospect of existing photosensitive compounds in herbal extracts enhanced by the application of laser diode has been promising. methods: the antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis was obtained by the disk diffusion method on agar. the laser diode ingaaip was used with 660 nm wavelength, 100 mw, and 4 j/cm(2), and the application was performed in a timely manner for 34 sec on each disk tested. the groups tested were: laser and bark extract (b+l+); bark extract only (b+l-); laser and leaf extract (f+l+); leaf extract only (f+l-); laser and malachite green (m+l+); malachite green only (m+l-); and laser only (l+). results: there were significant differences between the b+l- and b+l+ groups (p=0.029) and between the l+f- and l+f+ groups (p=0.029) at various concentrations of the nebulized extracts of bark and leaf. among the tested pathogens, s. aureus showed the highest zone of inhibition, 24.55+/-0.36 mm in group b+l+, 500 mg.ml(-1). conclusions: pdt with malachite green was effective, and groups b+l+ and f+l+ showed excellent activity on the bacteria tested, suggesting the presence of photosensitizers in extracts of s. brasiliensis engl.
purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
in vitro antibacterial activities of compounds isolated from roots of caylusea abyssinica.
background: caylusea absyssinica, a plant used as vegetable and for medicinal purposes was selected for in vitro antibacterial evaluation in this study. the main aim of this study was to isolate compounds from the plant roots and evaluate their antibacterial activities on clinical bacterial test strains. methods: compounds from roots of caylusea absyssinica (fresen) were identified based on observed spectral (1h-nmr, 13c-nmr and ir) data and physical properties (melting point) as well as reported literature. disk diffusion method was employed to evaluate the antibacterial activities of the isolated compounds on four test bacterial strains namely, staphylococcus aureus (atcc25903), escherichia coli (atcc25722), pseudomonas aeruginosa (dsmz1117) and salmonella thyphimurium (atcc13311). results: two compounds, ca1 and ca2 were isolated from the methanol crude extract of the roots of caylusea absyssinica (fresen). the compounds were identified as beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol, respectively. evaluation of antibacterial activities revealed that the compounds are active against all the bacterial strains in the experiment, showing inhibition zones ranging from 12 mm-15 mm by ca1 and 11 mm-18 mm by ca2 against the different test strains. however, the compounds were less active than the reference drug (gentamycine), which showed minimum inhibition zone of 21 mm (pseudomonas aeruginosa) and maximum of 28 mm (escherichia coli) inhibition zone. discussion and conclusion: the isolation of the compounds is the first report from roots of caylusea abyssinica and could be potential candidates for future antibacterial drug development programs.
antibacterial assay-guided isolation of active compounds from artocarpus heterophyllus heartwoods.
context: preparations from artocarpus heterophyllus lam. (moraceae) heartwoods are used in the traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, malarial fever, and to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. objective: the objective of this study was to isolate pure antibacterial compounds from a. heterophyllus heartwoods. materials and methods: the dried and powdered a. heterophyllus heartwoods were successively extracted with the following solvents: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. each of the extracts was screened for their antibacterial activities using a disc diffusion method (10 mg/disc). their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were determined using a broth microdilution method. the extract that showed the strongest antibacterial activities was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. results and discussion: the ethyl acetate extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against streptococcus mutans, s. pyogenes, and bacillus subtilis with mic values of 78, 39, and 9.8 microg/ml, respectively. based on an antibacterial assay-guided isolation, four antibacterial compounds: cycloartocarpin (1), artocarpin (2), artocarpanone (3), and cyanomaclurin (4) were purified. among these isolated compounds, artocarpin exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, including s. mutans, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis with mics of 4.4, 4.4, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microm, respectively, and mbcs of 8.9, 8.9, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microm, respectively, while artocarpanone showed the strongest activity against escherichia coli, a gram-negative bacteria with mic and mbc values of 12.9 and 25.8 microm, respectively. only artocarpin showed inhibitory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa with an mic of 286.4 microm.
ciprofloxacin-eluting nanofibers inhibits biofilm formation by pseudomonas aeruginosa and a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus are commonly associated with hospital-acquired infections and are known to form biofilms. ciprofloxacin (cip), which is normally used to treat these infections, is seldom effective in killing cells in a biofilm. this is mostly due to slow or weak penetration of cip to the core of biofilms. the problem is accentuated by the release of cip below mic (minimal inhibitory concentration) levels following a rapid (burst) release. the aim of this study was to develop a drug carrier that would keep cip above mic levels for an extended period. ciprofloxacin was suspended into poly(d,l-lactide) (pdlla) and poly(ethylene oxide) (peo), and electrospun into nanofibers (cip-f). all of the cip was released from the nanofibers within 2 h, which is typical of a burst release. however, 99% of p. aeruginosa pa01 cells and 91% of s. aureus xen 30 cells (a methicillin-resistant strain) in biofilms were killed when exposed to cip-f. cip levels remained above mic for 5 days, as shown by growth inhibition of the cells in vitro. the nanofibers were smooth in texture with no bead formation, as revealed by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. a single vibration peak at 1632 cm-1, recorded with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, indicated that cip remained in crystal form when incorporated into pdlla: peo. no abnormalities in the histology of mcf-12a breast epithelial cells were observed when exposed to cip-f. this is the first report of the inhibition of biofilm formation by cip released from pdlla: peo nanofibers.
increased prevalence and resistance of important pathogens recovered from respiratory specimens of cystic fibrosis patients during a decade.
background: the study objective was to identify changes of prevalence and resistance of important pathogens in specimens of cystic fibrosis (cf) patients within a decade. methods: samples of 94 patients, who attended 2 cf centers from 2001 to 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. results: staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent organism (74.5% in 2011) with an increase of methicillin-resistant s. aureus in patients (0% vs. 9.6%, n = 9). resistance of s. aureus to gentamicin decreased (41.8% vs. 21%; p < 0.001), whereas resistance to rifampicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (p < 0.05) increased significantly with a trend to increased resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin (p = 0.063). methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates belonged to 6 spa types (t003, t008, t011, t034, t045, t548). there was a significant increase of pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence (63.8% in 2011 vs. 46.8% in 2001, p = 0.019). resistance of p. aeruginosa increased significantly to imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin and fosfomycin, whereas resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem and aztreonam decreased. significantly fewer stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates were susceptible to all the analyzed antibiotics (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and colistin) in 2011 compared with 2001 (13.5% vs. 42.1%; p = 0.023), whereas the resistance to colistin increased significantly (11.1% vs. 62.2%; p < 0.001). burkholderia cepacia complex and nontuberculous mycobacteria were not detected in 2001 but in 2011 in 7.4% (n = 9) and 7.4% (n = 9) of patients, respectively. b. cepacia complex isolates belonged to 8 multilocus sequence types. conclusions: our retrospective analysis revealed an increase of important cf-related pathogens, the emergence of new pathogens and a substantial increase of multidrug-resistant cf-specific isolates. our findings are of importance to clinicians for the alertness of local epidemiology, which may be useful for prevention and treatment strategies.
synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of water-soluble silver(i) complexes of metronidazole drug and selected counter-ions.
a series of water-soluble silver(i) complexes of the type [ag(mtz)2x] [mtz = 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-5-nitro-1h-imidazole (metronidazole drug); x = no3(-), clo4(-), cf3coo(-), bf4(-) and ch3so3(-)] was synthesised by the reactions of various ag(i) salts with metronidazole (mtz). all the complexes were characterized by esi-ms spectrometry, solution nmr ((1)h and (13)c) and ir spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. further evidence for the formation and molecular structure of all the complexes was provided by x-ray single-crystal crystallography. the different counter ions affect the crystal packing of the complexes and thus have an impact on the final geometries. the antimicrobial activities of the complexes against two gram-positive strains: staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, three gram-negative strains: pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, escherichia coli atcc 25922, proteus hauseri atcc 13315 and yeast candida albicans atcc 10231 were evaluated and compared with antibacterial and antifungal properties of appropriate silver salts, metronidazole and silver sulfadiazine drugs. the newly synthesized compounds exhibited significant antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, better than the referenced silver sulfadiazine. the best active silver(i)-metronidazole complex contains a methanesulphonate counter-ion. moreover, the complex inhibited the growth of yeast candida albicans at a concentration 3-fold lower than that required for silver sulfadiazine. in addition, the complexes containing a tetrafluoroborate and a perchlorate as counter-ions were characterized as effective antibacterial agents against the tested gram-negative bacteria.
determination of bacterial etiological agents, sensitivity pattern and clinical outcome of patients with bacterial endocarditis at punjab institute of cardiology, lahore.
objective: to determine the type of pathogens causing bacterial endocarditis, their in vitro drug susceptibility profile and the effect of empirical antibiotic therapy in endocarditis patients. methods: the prospective study was conducted at the punjab institute of cardiology, lahore, from january to november 2013. blood samples of endocarditis patients in the 20-40 age group were collected and culture-positive patients were included in the study. antibiotics given to patients as empirical therapy were noted. antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates against various antibiotics was determined in vitro by using kirby bauer disc diffusion technique. the results were interpreted as frequencies and percentages. results: of the 110 endocarditis patients initially scanned, 60(54.5%) were culture-positive and represented the study sample. of them, 31(51.7%) were men and 29(48.3%) were women. the combination of benzyl penicillin and gentamicin was given to 11(18.3%) patients, while combination of vancomycin and gentamicin and vancomycin alone was also given to 3(5%) and 6(10%) patients respectively. overall, 53(88.3%) isolates were gram-positive and 7(11.7%) were gram-negative. among gram-positive isolates, 39(65%) were methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 2(3.3%) were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 12(20%) were streptococcus species. among the gram-negative group, 5(8.4%) isolates were of escherichia coli, 2(3.3%) were of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive revealed 100% susceptibility to vancomycin. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed 100% in vitro susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin+tazobactam and tigecycline, while escherichia coli showed 60% susceptibility to amikacin and co-amoxiclav. conclusion: the frequency of gram-positive organisms causing endocarditis was high. vancomycin in gram-positive cases revealed better in vitro efficacy, while in gram-negative cases, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin+tazobactam, tigecycline amikacin and co-amoxiclav were more effective than other antibiotics.
2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides: synthesis, molecular docking, antimicrobial and anticancer properties.
in this study, a series of novel 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. their structure was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data (ft-ir, lc-ms, 1h-nmr). antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, candida albicans and nci in vitro preliminary anticancer activity against nine different cancer types. the most active antibacterial and antifungal compounds were: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. the introduction of the carboxylic acid or amide residue into the fourth position of quinazolin-4(3h)-thione resulted in the absence of antimicrobial activity. substance 3.8 inhibited renal cancer uo-31 line and 2.18 - leukemia ccrf-cem. the results of in silico molecular docking for dhfr and ck2 kinase had no correlation with in vitro properties, proposing the presence of other biological activity pathways.
comparison of essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of coriandrum  sativum l. extracted by hydrodistillation and microwave-assisted hydrodistillation.
coriander (coriandrum sativum l.), is an annual herb in the apiaceae family which disperses in mediterranean and middle eastern regions. the coriander essential oil has been used in food products, perfumes, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries for its flavor and odor. in iran, fruits of coriander used in pickle, curry powders, sausages, cakes, pastries, biscuits and buns. the aim of this study was to investigate microwave radiation effects on quality, quantity and antimicrobial activity of essential oil of coriander fruits. the essential oils were obtained from the coriander fruits by hydrodistillation (hd) and microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (mahd) then, the oils were analyzed by gc and gc-ms. antimicrobial activities of essential oils were evaluated against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans by microdilution method. the results indicated that the hd and mahd essential oils (eo) were dominated by monoterpenoids such as linalool, geranyl acetate and gamma-terpinene. the major compound in both eo was linalool which its amount in hd and mahd was 63 % and 66 %, respectively. the total amount of monoterpenes hydrocarbons in hd eo differ significantly with the amount in mahd eo (12.56 % compare to 1.82 %). hd eo showed greater activity against staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans than mahd eo. moreover, their activities against ecoli and p. aeruginosa were the same with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) 0.781 and 6.25 mul ml(-1), respectively. by using mahd method, it was superior in terms of saving energy and extraction time, although the oil yield and total composition decrease by using this method.
staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in a premature newborn caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus: case report.
context: staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is an exfoliative skin disease. reports of this syndrome in newborns caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus are rare but, when present, rapid diagnosis and treatment is required in order to decrease morbidity and mortality. case report: a premature newly born girl weighing 1,520 g, born with a gestational age of 29 weeks and 4 days, developed staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome on the fifth day of life. cultures on blood samples collected on the first and fourth days were negative, but pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus sp. (vancomycin-sensitive) developed in blood cultures performed on the day of death (seventh day), and pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens were identified in cultures on nasopharyngeal, buttock and abdominal secretions. in addition to these two gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was isolated in a culture on the umbilical stump (seventh day). the diagnosis of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome was based on clinical criteria.
chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil from agathis dammara (lamb.) rich fresh leaves.
the essential oil of fresh leaves from agathis dammara (lamb.) rich was extracted using hydro-distillation, and gc-fid and gc-ms were used to analyse the essential oil. nineteen compounds were identified, among which the major components were limonene (36.81%), beta-bisabolene (33.43%) and beta-myrcene (25.48%). in the antibacterial test, disc diffusion method and micro-well dilution assay proved that the essential oil had significant antibacterial activities. the inhibition zones against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were 23.7 and 23 mm, respectively, which demonstrated that the inhibition effects were greater than positive control (10 mug/disc streptomycin). and the lowest mic value of the essential oil was found against s. aureus (1.25 mg/ml) and bacillus subtilis (1.25 mg/ml). this is the first report on the antibacterial activities of a. dammara essential oil.
antibacterial and antifungal activity of solvent extracts from plumeria obtusa linn.
extracts of plumeria obtusa are widely used in ethnomedicine and have been investigated for a variety of biological activities; however, the antimicrobial activity of p. obtusa flowers is poorly characterized. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of different solvents (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, chloroform, isobutanol and ethanol) extracts from flowers of p. obtusa were investigated by a disc diffusion method against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and a fungus. all extracts exhibited growth inhibition of all microorganisms at variable degrees as measured by relative zones of inhibition, however, the petroleum ether extract was ineffective against klebsiella pneumonia and ethyl acetate and isobutanol extracts were ineffective against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the most susceptible gram-positive bacterium was bacillus subtilis while the most resistant gram-positive bacterium was staphylococcus aureus. erwinia carotovora was the most susceptible gram-negative bacterium while p. aeruginosa was highly resistant among the gram-negative bacteria. in this study, for the first time, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of several different solvent extracts from flowers of p. obtusa against a broad spectrum of human-pathogenic microorganisms. these compounds warrant further investigation by isolation and structural elucidation with the aim to find novel and affordable bioactive compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases.
synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4-bromo-1h-indazole derivatives as  ftsz inhibitors.
a series of novel 4-bromo-1h-indazole derivatives as filamentous temperature-sensitive protein z (ftsz) inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against various phenotypes of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and their cell division inhibitory activity. the results indicated that this series showed better antibacterial activity against staphylococcus epidermidis and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pyogenes than the other tested strains. among them, compounds 12 and 18 exhibited 256-fold and 256-fold more potent activity than 3-methoxybenzamide (3-mba) against penicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and compound 18 showed 64-fold better activity than 3-mba but 4-fold weaker activity than ciprofloxacin in the inhibition of s. aureus atcc29213. particularly, compound 9 presented the best activity (4 microg/ml) against s. pyogenes ps, being 32-fold, 32-fold, and 2-fold more active than 3-mba, curcumin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively, but it was four times less active than oxacillin sodium. in addition, some synthesized compounds displayed moderate inhibition of cell division against s. aureus atcc25923, escherichia coli atcc25922, and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853, sharing a minimum cell division concentration of 128 microg/ml.
broad-spectrum antimicrobial polycarbonate hydrogels with fast degradability.
in this study, a new family of broad-spectrum antimicrobial polycarbonate hydrogels has been successfully synthesized and characterized. tertiary amine-containing eight-membered monofunctional and difunctional cyclic carbonates were synthesized, and chemically cross-linked polycarbonate hydrogels were obtained by copolymerizing these monomers with a poly(ethylene glycol)-based bifunctional initiator via organocatalyzed ring-opening polymerization using 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene catalyst. the gels were quaternized using methyl iodide to confer antimicrobial properties. stable hydrogels were obtained only when the bifunctional monomer concentration was equal to or higher than 12 mol %. in vitro antimicrobial studies revealed that all quaternized hydrogels exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive), escherichia coli (gram-negative), pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative), and candida albicans (fungus), while the antimicrobial activity of the nonquaternized hydrogels was negligible. moreover, the gels showed fast degradation at room temperature (4-6 days), which makes them ideal candidates for wound healing and implantable biomaterials.
quantification of pseudomonas aeruginosa in multispecies biofilms using pma-qpcr.
multispecies biofilms are an important healthcare problem and may lead to persistent infections. these infections are difficult to treat, as cells in a biofilm are highly resistant to antimicrobial agents. while increasingly being recognized as important, the properties of multispecies biofilms remain poorly studied. in order to do so, the quantification of the individual species is needed. the current cultivation-based approaches can lead to an underestimation of the actual cell number and are time-consuming. in the present study we set up a culture-independent approach based on propidium monoazide qpcr (pma-qpcr) to quantify pseudomonas aeruginosa in a multispecies biofilm. as a proof of concept, we explored the influence of the combined presence of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus and burkholderia cenocepacia on the antimicrobial susceptibility of p. aeruginosa using this pma-qpcr approach.
evaluation of antibacterial activity of some traditionally used medicinal plants  against human pathogenic bacteria.
the worldwide increase of multidrug resistance in both community- and health-care associated bacterial infections has impaired the current antimicrobial therapy, warranting the search for other alternatives. we aimed to find the in vitro antibacterial activity of ethanolic extracts of 16 different traditionally used medicinal plants of nepal against 13 clinical and 2 reference bacterial species using microbroth dilution method. the evaluated plants species were found to exert a range of in vitro growth inhibitory action against the tested bacterial species, and cynodon dactylon was found to exhibit moderate inhibitory action against 13 bacterial species including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, multidrug-resistant salmonella typhi, and s. typhimurium. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of tested ethanolic extracts were found from 31 to >25,000 mug/ml. notably, ethanolic extracts of cinnamomum camphora, curculigo orchioides, and curcuma longa exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against s. pyogenes with a mic of 49, 49, and 195 mug/ml, respectively; whereas chloroform fraction of cynodon dactylon exhibited best antibacterial activity against s. aureus with a mic of 31 mug/ml. among all, c. dactylon, c. camphora, c. orchioides, and c. longa plant extracts displayed a potential antibacterial activity of mic < 100 mug/ml.
design, synthesis and in vitro bactericidal/fungicidal screening of some vanadyl(iv)complexes with mono- and di-substituted ons donor triazoles.
abstract a new series of anti-bacterial and anti-fungal mono- and di-substituted  triazoles (l1)-(l6) have been synthesized and characterized on the basis of their physical, spectral and analytical data. the ligands (l1)-(l6) on reaction with vanadyl(iv) sulphate led to the formation of vanadyl(iv) metal complexes (1)-(4). the structure of the complexes has been established on the basis of their physical, spectral and elemental analyses data. the synthesized ligands and their vanadyl(iv) complexes have been screened in vitro for anti-bacterial activity against six bacterial species such as, escherichia coli (atcc 25922), shigella flexneri (atcc 12022), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), salmonella typhi (atcc 14028), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923) and bacillus subtilis (atcc 6051) and for in vitro anti-fungal activity against six fungal strains, trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glabrata. the screening results showed the vanadyl complexes to be more bactericidal/fungicidal against one or more bacterial/fungal species. the synthesized compounds were also subjected to brine shrimp bioassay for scrutinizing their cytotoxicity.

biogenic silver and gold nanoparticles synthesized using red ginseng root extract, and their applications.
in the present study, we report a green methodology for the synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles, using the root extract of the herbal medicinal plant korean red ginseng. the silver and gold nanoparticles were synthesized within 1 h and 10 min respectively. the nanoparticles generated were not aggregated, and remained stable for a long time, which suggests the nature of nanoparticles. the phytochemicals and ginsenosides present in the root extract assist in reducing and stabilizing the synthesized nanoparticles. the red ginseng root extract-generated silver nanoparticles exhibit antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms including vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and candida albicans. in addition, the silver nanoparticles exhibit biofilm degrading activity against s. aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus, the present study opens up a new possibility of synthesizing silver and gold nanoparticles in a green and rapid manner using korean red ginseng root extract, and explores their biomedical applications.
antimicrobial and antifungal activity of pelargonium roseum essential oils.
purpose: the antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the xx(th) century. in the current study essential oils obtained from pelargonium roseum (geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the pelargonium essential oil was tested against gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and fungi (candida albicans). disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. results: inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. in the case of candida albicans, the complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. in the cases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. conclusion: the volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. there were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available pelargonium oils.
comparison of the chemistry and diversity of endophytes isolated from wild-harvested and greenhouse-cultivated yerba mansa ().
with this study, we explored the identity and chemistry of fungal endophytes from the roots of yerba mansa [anemopsis californica (nutt.) hook. & arn. (saururaceae)], a botanical traditionally used to treat infection. we compared the diversity of fungal endophytes isolated from a wild-harvested a. californica population, and those from plants cultivated for one year in a greenhouse environment. the wild-harvested population yielded thirteen fungal strains (eleven unique genotypes). of the extracts prepared from these fungi, four inhibited growth of staphylococcus aureus by >25% at 20 microg/ml, and three inhibited growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa by >/=20% at 200 microg/ml. by comparison, a. californica roots after one year of cultivation in the greenhouse produced only two unique genotypes, neither of which displayed significant antimicrobial activity. the fungus chaetomium cupreum isolated from wild-harvested a. californica yielded a new antimicrobial spirolactone, chaetocuprum (1). an additional fourteen known compounds were identified using lc-ms dereplication of the various fungal endophytes. this study provides new insights into the identity and chemistry of a. californica fungal endophytes, and demonstrates the importance of considering growing conditions when pursuing natural product drug discovery from endophytic fungi.
ph influence on antibacterial efficacy of common antiseptic substances.
background: wound infection plays an important role in compromised wound healing. a high bioburden impairs healing and leads to formation of a chronic wound. distinctly higher ph values were observed in chronic wounds compared to acute wounds. however, there is only limited knowledge of ph dependency on the antibacterial efficacy of common antimicrobial substances. methods: this study investigated the ph influence on the antimicrobial efficacy of povidone (pvp)-iodine, silver nitrate, chlorhexidine, octenidine and polihexanide against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar diffusion test and microplate laser nephelometry. results: the bactericidal activity of chlorhexidine and octenidine was mainly ph-independent in a ph range of 5.0-9.0. in contrast, polihexanide showed a significant efficacy increase at a higher ph. it was also found that the influence of the ph on antiseptics differs among species of bacteria. for instance, s. aureus exhibited an increasing sensitivity against silver nitrate with rising ph whereas the effect on p. aeruginosa was found to be distinctly decreased. the antimicrobial effect of pvp-iodine was strongly diminished with rising ph. conclusions: the shift towards higher ph values in chronic wounds compared to acute wounds makes it imperative to know whether the antimicrobial efficacy of applied antimicrobial substances is altered by different ph levels. the results suggest that application of polihexanide might be advantageous for the management of wound infections, as both s. aureus and p. aeruginosa exhibited an increased susceptibility with rising ph.
screening of antimicrobial activity of macroalgae extracts from the moroccan atlantic coast.
the aim of this work is the screening of the antimicrobial activity of seaweed extracts against pathogenic bacteria and yeasts. the antimicrobial activity of the dichloromethane and ethanol extracts of ten marine macroalgae collected from the moroccan's atlantic coast (el-jadida) was tested against two gram+ (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus) and two gram- (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) human pathogenic bacteria, and against two pathogenic yeasts (candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) using the agar disk-diffusion method. seven algae (70%) of ten seaweeds are active against at least one pathogenic microorganisms studied. five (50%) are active against the two studied yeast with an inhibition diameter greater than 15mm for cystoseira brachycarpa. six (60%) seaweeds are active against at least one studied bacteria with five (50%) algae exhibiting antibacterial inhibition diameter greater than 15mm. cystoseira brachycarpa, cystoseira compressa, fucus vesiculosus, and gelidium sesquipedale have a better antimicrobial activity with a broad spectrum antimicrobial and are a potential source of antimicrobial compounds and can be subject of isolation of the natural antimicrobials.
antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

chemical composition and biological activity of pulicaria vulgaris essential oil  from iran.
the present study investigated the chemical composition of the essential oil (eo) from aerial parts (flowering stage) of pulicaria vulgaris gaertn. by gc-ms. also, the antimicrobial activity of the eo against gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi (aspergillus niger and candida albicans) was tested. in total, 23 compounds were recognized, accounting for 98.08% of the eo. the main compounds in the eo were thymol (50.22%), p-menth-6-en-2-one (carvotanacetone, 20.2%), thymol isobutyrate (16.88%), menthan-2-one (4.31%), 1-methyl-1,2-propanedione (4.13%), 2,5-dimethoxy-p-cymene (4.01%), myrtenol (1.22%), linalool (1.1%), and beta-myrcene (1.9%). results of antibacterial test of p. vulgaris essential oil showed that all assayed concentrations significantly inhibited the growth of b. cereus, s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at p < 0.05. mic for b. cereus, s. aureus, e. coli, p. aeruginosa was 17.5, 25.2, 19.4 and 33.2 mug/ml respectively; antifungal screening of the essential oil of p. vulgaris showed that the oil significantly inhibited the growth of a. niger and c. albicans (mic = 15.5 and 9.9 mug/ml, respectively). results of cytotoxicity assay showed that the essential oil exhibited a significant cytotoxic activity against both cell lines. in case of mcf-7 and hep-g2 cell lines, ic50 of the essential oil were 5.36 and 7.16 mug/ml, respectively. the potent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of the eo may be attributed to its high contents of thymol, carvotanacetone and thymol isobutyrate. antimicrobial and antitumor chemotherapies are showing diminishing effectiveness because of emergence of drug-resistance. hence, using efficient natural chemotherapeutic agents such as pulicaria vulgaris essential oil with fewer side effects is an encouraging approach to fight cancer and infectious diseases in medicine, agriculture, food science and related fields.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts obtained from vegetative organs of a. retroflexus.
in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of amaranthus retroflexus leaves and inflorescence alcoholic (ethanol 70%) extracts of various concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 400 mul/ml were analyzed on different clinical and reference bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtills, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii) and fungal strains (candida albicans, c. famata, c. utilis, saccharomyces cerevisiae) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (mic determination) for antimicrobial activity and teac (trolox capacity) assay for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity. the adapted diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial effect of the extracts separately and in combination with a range of standard antibiotics, in order to evidence any synergic effects of a. retroflexus extracts on the antibiotics activity. the extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect against k. pneumoniae and b. subtilis with no activity against s. aureus among the bacterial strains, while in case of the fungal strains the most intensive effect was exhibited against c. famata by both extracts. the a. retroflexus leaves extract improved the ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid activity towards the p. aeruginosa clinical strain. the inflorescences extract significantly increased chloramphenicol activity on b. subtilis strain. the antioxidant activity assay showed that the studied extracts exhibited the ability to neutralize the free radicals leading to the conclusion that the tested extracts bear compounds with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that could represent a potential alternative for treating various infectious diseases.
[trends in antibiotic resistance in medellin and municipalities of the metropolitan area between 2007 and 2012: results of six years of surveillance].
introduction: bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. objective: to determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in medellin and its metropolitan area. materials and methods: percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using whonet 5.6 program. for interpretation of susceptibility results, clsi standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. using the epi-info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. results: in six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). in escherichia coli and serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). k. pneumoniae , s. marcescens and e. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii . conclusions: the resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of e. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae . it is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
importance of tryptophan in transforming an amphipathic peptide into a pseudomonas aeruginosa-targeted antimicrobial peptide.
here, we found that simple substitution of amino acids in the middle position of  the hydrophobic face of an amphipathic peptide ri16 with tryptophan (t9w) considerably transformed into an antimicrobial peptide specifically targeting pseudomonas aeruginosa. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) results demonstrated that t9w had a strong and specifically antimicrobial activity against p. aeruginosa, including antibiotic-resistant strains, but was not active against escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus and staphyfococcus epidermidis. fluorescent spectroscopic assays indicated that t9w interacted with the membrane of p. aeruginosa, depolarizing the outer and the inner membrane of bacterial cells. salt susceptibility assay showed that t9w still maintained its strong anti-pseudomonas activity in the presence of salts at physiological concentrations, and in hemolytic and mtt assays t9w also showed no toxicity against human blood cells and macrophages. in vivo assay demonstrated that t9w also displayed no toxicity to chinese kun ming (km) mice. furthermore, the strong antibiofilm activity was also observed with the peptide t9w, which decreased the percentage of biomass formation in a dose-dependent manner. overall, these findings indicated that design of single-pathogen antimicrobial agents can be achieved by simple amino acid mutation in naturally occurring peptide sequences and this study suggested a model of optimization/design of anti-pseudomonas drugs in which the tryptophan residue was a conserved element.
trends and correlation of antibacterial usage and bacterial resistance: time series analysis for antibacterial stewardship in a chinese teaching hospital (2009-2013).
the purpose of this investigation was to describe the effect of antibacterial stewardship and evaluate the trends and correlation of antibacterial resistance and usage from 2009 to 2013 in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in northwest china. antibacterial usage was expressed as defined daily doses per 100 patients per day (ddds/100 pds). hospital-wide population-level data and time series analysis were used to evaluate the trends and determine associations between antibacterial exposure and acquisition of resistance. yearly consumption of overall antibacterials significantly decreased from 66.54 to 28.08 ddds/100 pds (beta = -10.504, p < 0.01). the resistant rates of the five most frequently isolated species (including escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) significantly decreased or remained stable, and none of them showed a statistically significant upward trend. the medical quality indicators got better or remained stable. autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models demonstrated that the monthly resistance rate of p. aeruginosa to imipenem was strongly correlated with antipseudomonal carbapenems usage (beta = 34.94, p < 0.001), as did the correlation of p. aeruginosa to meropenem with antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporins usage (beta = 32.76, p < 0.01) and k. pneumoniae to amikacin with aminoglycosides usage (beta = 22.01, p < 0.001). the decreased antibacterial use paralleled the improved bacterial resistance without deteriorating medical quality indicators during antimicrobial stewardship. it also suggests that optimum antibiotic use is necessary to alleviate the threat posed by resistant microorganisms at the hospital level.

in this study, antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities and the chemical composition of thymus sipyleus boiss. subsp. sipyleus boiss. var. davisianus ronniger essential oil was evaluated. the essential oil was obtained by hydro-distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. fourteen compounds were characterized, having as major components thymol (38.31 %) and carvacrol (37.95 %). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of oil and the major components were calculated by serial dilution method, and anti-biofilm effects by microplate biofilm assay against five gram positive (staphylococcus aureus mu 38, mu 40, mu 46, mu 47, stahylococcus epidermidis mu 30) and five gram negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa mu 187, mu 188, mu 189, pseudomonas fluorescens mu 180, mu 181) bacteria. it was found that mics for essential oil, thymol and carvacrol were between 5 and 50 microl/ml, 0.125-0.5 microg/ml and 0.125-05 microl/ml, respectively. the results showed that doses of mic produced a greater anti-biofilm influence than 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 mic. in the presence of essential oil (mic), the mean biofilm formation value was equal to 67 +/- 5.5 % for p. aeruginosa mu 188, and essential oil (mic) inhibition exceeds 60 % for p. aeruginosa biofilms. the results also showed that carvacrol (mic) was able to induce an inhibition 72.9 +/- 4.1 % for s.aureus (mu 40) biofilm. in addition, thymol (mic) showed 68.6 +/- 5.3 % reduction in biofilm formation of p. fluorescens mu 181. this study demonstrated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of t. sipyleus boiss. subsp. sipyleus boiss. var. davisianus ronniger essential oil and points out the exceptional efficiency of thymol and carvacrol, which could represent candidates in the treatment of pseudomonas and staphylococcus biofilms.
antimicrobial potential of helicanthus elastica (desr.) danser - a less explored  indian mistletoe growing on mango trees.
helicanthus elastica (desr.) danser (loranthaceae) is a less-known medicinally important mistletoe species occurring in india. it is used to check abortion, and also in vesical calculi and kidney affections. there are no detailed studies reporting the antimicrobial potential of this plant. based on the traditional use and the rich phenolic composition of the whole plant, the antimicrobial property of the alcohol extract was analyzed and the results are outlined in the present paper. for the analysis, zone of inhibition, and minimum inhibitory concentration were used, and the total activity was assayed by standard methodologies. the antimicrobial activity was studied against bacteria like aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes, vibrio fischeri, and a fungus candida albicans. of the eight tested bacteria, the alcoholic extract of h. elastica was found to be active against k. pneumoniae, a. hydrophila, e. coli, and v. fischeri at concentration ranging from 250 to 500 mug/ml. c. albicans showed inhibition only at a concentration of 2000 mug/ml.
differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections between general wards and ricu.
background: lower respiratory tract infections (lrtis) are common among patients  in hospitals worldwide, especially in patients over the age of 60. this study investigates the differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lrtis. methods: the clinical and laboratory data of 4,762 lrti patients in the general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (ricu) of xiangya hospital (changsha) were retrospectively analyzed. results: the infection rate of gram-negative bacteria was significantly higher than that of gram-positive bacteria in both the general ward and ricu (p<0.05). the incidence of gram-negative bacteria infection was significantly higher in the ricu than in the general ward (p<0.05), whereas the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection is less in the ricu than in the general ward (p<0.05). in the general ward, the incidence of gram-negative bacteria infection significantly increased (p<0.05) over time, whereas the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection significantly decreased from 1996 to 2011 (p<0.05). in the ricu, the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection decreased, while gram-negative bacteria infections increased without statistical significance (p>0.05). staphylococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were found to be the predominant gram-positive strains in the general ward (34.70-41.18%) and ricu (41.66-54.87%), respectively (p>0.05). pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant gram negative strains in the general ward (19.17-21.09%) and ricu (29.60-33.88%), respectively (p>0.05). streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to most antibiotics with a sensitivity of more than 70%. staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (100%), chloramphenicol (74.36-82.19%), doxycycline (69.57-77.33%), and sulfamethoprim (67.83-72.46%); however, its sensitivity to other antibiotics is low and decreased each year. sensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa to most beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and quinolone group antibiotics decreased each year. conclusions: the distribution and drug sensitivity of lrti pathogens exhibit a high divergence between the general ward and ricu. streptococcus pneumoniae may not be the predominant pathogen in lrtis in some areas of china.

(z. multiflora) against important human pathogens. methods: pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella dysenteriae, klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumonia), enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus were kinds of pathogenic bacteria to determine the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of m. longifolia and hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora using broth microdiluation method. results: the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.25 and 2.5 mg/ml) were observed by the hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and serratia marcescens (2.5 and 5 mg/ml) were observed by the aqueous extracts of m. longifolia. conclusions: in conclusion, it seems that z. multiflora and m. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of the mentioned bacteria.
antimicrobial activity of fermented theobroma cacao pod husk extract.
theobroma cacao l. contains more than 500 different chemical compounds some of which have been traditionally used for their antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, immunomodulatory, vasodilatory, analgesic, and antimicrobial activities. spontaneous aerobic fermentation of cacao husks yields a crude husk extract (che) with antimicrobial activity. che was fractioned by solvent partition with polar solvent extraction or by silica gel chromatography and a total of 12 sub-fractions were analyzed for chemical composition and bioactivity. che was effective against the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and the basidiomycete moniliophthora perniciosa. antibacterial activity was determined using 6 strains: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus subtilis (gram-positive) and pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella choleraesuis (gram-negative). at doses up to 10 mg/ml, che was not effective against the gram-positive bacteria tested but against medically important p. aeruginosa and s. choleraesuis with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 5.0 mg/ml. sub-fractions varied widely in activity and strongest antibacterial activity was seen with che8 against s. choleraesuis (mic of 1.0 mg/ml) and che9 against s. epidermidis (mic of 2.5 mg/ml). all bioactive che fractions contained phenols, steroids, or terpenes, but no saponins. fraction che9 contained flavonoids, phenolics, steroids, and terpenes, amino acids, and alkaloids, while che12 had the same compounds but lacked flavonoids.
chemical identification and evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of fixed oil extracted from rhinella jimi.
context: the toad rhinella jimi (stevaux, 2002) (bufonidae) is used in traditional medicine to treat a number of illnesses (inflammation, infections, and wounds) in humans as well as animals. objectives: the present work examined the antimicrobial actions of the extracted oils from the body fat of r. jimi (orj) against fungi and standard and multi-resistant lines of bacteria, as well as their effects when combined with aminoglycosides. materials and methods: the toads were collected in the municipality of exu in pernambuco state, brazil, and their body fat oils extracted in a soxhlet apparatus using hexane. a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer was used to identify the fatty acids, based on their methyl esters. the antimicrobial activities of the oil were analyzed against standard and multi-resistant lines of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against fungal lines of candida albicans and candida krusei using the broth micro-dilution method. results: the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of orj were 512 microg/ml for candida krusei and >/=1024 microg/ml for the other microorganisms. when associated with amikacin, orj demonstrated an increase in its ability to inhibit e. coli growth (from 156.25 to 39.06 microg/ml), indicating synergistic interaction. in the same way, when allied with amikacin, gentamicin, and neomycin, the orj reduced the mics meaningly, against p. aeruginosa. conclusions: these data will enable searches to be made to obtain new products in combination with antibiotics, enhancing the efficacy of these drugs against drug-resistant microorganisms.
synthesis, in vitro anticancer and antimicrobial evaluation of novel substituted  dihydropyrimidines.
a series of 1,4-dihydropyrimidine derivatives 3(a-t) were prepared from biginelli reactions by using ethyl acetoacetate, substituted benzaldehyde and thiourea in the presence of piperidine and ethanol. the compounds 3(a-t) were reacted with dimethylsulphate, diethylsulphate, butyl bromide and benzyl chloride to give the new series of compounds 4(a-t). the structures of the newly synthesized compounds 4(a-t) were established by ir, (1)h nmr, mass spectra and elemental analysis. the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity by using sulforhodamine b assay method against the growth of four humans cancer cell lines, antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and for antifungal activity against candida albicans and aspergillus niger. the compounds exhibited good anticancer activity and moderate antibacterial and antifungal activities. compounds 4b, 4c, 4d, 4g, 4i, 4n, 4o, 4q and 4s showed significant anticancer activity when compared with the doxorubicin as a standard reference drug.
evaluation of the effectiveness of an infection control program in adult intensive care units: a report from a middle-income country.
background: the rates of hand hygiene improvement and health care-associated infections (hais) were evaluated after the introduction in 2004 of an infection surveillance and prevention program at a university teaching hospital in a low- to middle-income country. methods: data on hand hygiene compliance, hai rate, multiresistant organisms, and antibiotic consumption in 4 adult intensive care units (icus; medical, general surgery, anesthesiology and reanimation, and neurosurgery) were collected retrospectively for each year from 2004 to 2012. negative binomial regression modeling with a log link was used to adjust for overdispersion in observations, and the first year of observations served as the baseline for comparing changes in incidence rate ratio (irr) over the subsequent years. results: total hand hygiene compliance improved from 30.5% in 2004 to 43.5% by 2010 (irr, 1.3; p <.0001) and reached 63.8% by 2012 (irr, 1.9; p < .0001). the hai rate was 42.6/1,000 patient-days at baseline and increased significantly thereafter until 2012, when it decreased by 20% to 33.6/1,000 patient-days (irr, 0.8; p = .001). the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was 7.85 (95% confidence interval [ci], 5.89-10.26)/1,000 catheter-days in 2004 and increased to 12.4 (95% ci, 9.98-14.39)/1,000 catheter-days in 2012 (irr, 1.5; p = .024). the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia remained stable from the 2004 baseline rate of 31.66/1,000 ventilator-days to the 2012 rate of 24.04/ 1,000 ventilator-days (irr, 0.88; p = .574). the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection remained relatively stable between 2004 and 2012 (from 7.92/1,000 catheter-days to 4.97/1,000 catheter-days; p = .101). the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection was 6.24/1,000 patient-days at baseline and decreased significantly to 0.73/1,000 patient-days by 2007 (irr, 0.13; p <.001) and continued to remain below 2/1,000 patient-days for the next 5 years. the rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa infection decreased significantly from 8.66/1,000 patient-days in 2004 to 6.09/1,000 patient-days in 2010 (irr, 0.72; p = .026) and to 5.44/1,000 patient-days by 2012 (irr, 0.63; p = .002). the rate of acinetobacter baumannii infection was 14.3/1,000 patient-days at baseline, decreased significantly by 2005 (irr, 0.73; p = .012), fluctuated between 2006 and 2010, and then decreased significantly to 10.44/1,000 patient-days in 2011 (irr, 0.74; p = .007) and then to 7.6/1,000 patient-days in 2012 (irr, 0.53; p < .001). antibiotic consumption did not decrease noticeably over the 9-year study period. conclusions: hand hygiene improved in all of the icus evaluated. measuring changes in hai rates in a single health care setting can be statistically challenging, and a bias in the detection rates is not uncommon in the early years of a new infection prevention program. here, for the first time, implementation of an infection surveillance and prevention program was associated with a reduction in hai rate.
tri- and tetra-nuclear polypyridyl ruthenium(ii) complexes as antimicrobial agents.
a series of inert tri- and tetra-nuclear polypyridylruthenium(ii) complexes that  are linked by the bis[4(4'-methyl-2,2'-bipyridyl)]-1,n-alkane ligand ("bb(n)" for n = 10, 12 and 16) have been synthesised and their potential as antimicrobial agents examined. due to the modular nature of the synthesis of the oligonuclear complexes, it was possible to make both linear and non-linear tetranuclear ruthenium species. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the ruthenium(ii) complexes were determined against four strains of bacteria--gram positive staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and gram negative escherichia coli (e. coli) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa). in order to gain an understanding of the relative antimicrobial activities, the cellular uptake and water-octanol partition coefficients (log p) were determined for a selection of the ruthenium complexes. although the trinuclear complexes were the most lipophilic based upon log p values and showed the greatest cellular uptake, the linear tetranuclear complexes were generally more active, with mic values <1 mum against the gram positive bacteria. similarly, although the non-linear tetranuclear complexes were slightly more lipophilic and were taken up to a greater extent by the bacteria, they were consistently less active than their linear counterparts. of particular note, the cellular accumulation of the oligonuclear ruthenium complexes was greater in the gram negative strains compared to that in the gram positive s. aureus and mrsa. the results demonstrate that the lower antimicrobial activity of polypyridylruthenium(ii) complexes towards gram negative bacteria, particularly p. aeruginosa, is not strongly correlated to the cellular accumulation but rather to a lower intrinsic ability to kill the gram negative cells.
update on the antibiotic resistance crisis.
antibiotics tend to lose their efficacy over time due to the emergence and dissemination of resistance among bacterial pathogens. strains with resistance to multiple antibiotic classes have emerged among major gram-positive and gram-negative species including staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. enterobacteriaceae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. with some gram-negatives, resistance may involve most or even all the available antimicrobial options, resulting in extremely drug-resistant or totally drug-resistant phenotypes. this so-called 'antibiotic resistance crisis' has been compounded by the lagging in antibiotic discovery and development programs occurred in recent years, and is jeopardizing the essential role played by antibiotics in current medical practices.
synthesis of novel benzimidazole functionalized chiral thioureas and evaluation of their antibacterial and anticancer activities.
a small library of benzimidazole functionalized chiral thioureas was prepared starting from natural amino acids (s)-alanine, (s)-phenylalanine, (s)-valine and (s)-leucine and also their (r)-isomers and studied their antimicrobial activity against a various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. in this study, compounds 5g and 5j were found to exhibit good antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains such as staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, klebsiella planticola, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in the cytotoxicity study, thioureas derived from non-natural amino acids 5a-l showed good activity against human cancer cell lines a549, mcf7, du145, hela, and no cytotoxicity was observed with their antipodes 6a-l.
curcumin-encapsulated nanoparticles as innovative antimicrobial and wound healing agent.
burn wounds are often complicated by bacterial infection, contributing to morbidity and mortality. agents commonly used to treat burn wound infection are limited by toxicity, incomplete microbial coverage, inadequate penetration, and rising resistance. curcumin is a naturally derived substance with innate antimicrobial and wound healing properties. acting by multiple mechanisms, curcumin is less likely than current antibiotics to select for resistant bacteria. curcumin's poor aqueous solubility and rapid degradation profile hinder usage; nanoparticle encapsulation overcomes this pitfall and enables extended topical delivery of curcumin. in this study, we synthesized and characterized curcumin nanoparticles (curc-np), which inhibited in vitro growth of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa in dose-dependent fashion, and inhibited mrsa growth and enhanced wound healing in an in vivo murine wound model. curc-np may represent a novel topical antimicrobial and wound healing adjuvant for infected burn wounds and other cutaneous injuries. from the clinical editor: this team of authors created curcumin nanoparticles in an effort to overcome curcumin's endogenously poor aqueous solubility and demonstrated in a murine model its antimicrobial and wound healing properties that also resulted in growth inhibition of mrsa and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
antibacterial effects of protruding and recessed shark skin micropatterned surfaces of polyacrylate plate with a shallow groove.
antibacterial effects in terms of biofilm formation and swarming motility were studied using polyacrylate plates having protruding or recessed shark skin micropatterned surfaces with a shallow groove (2 mum pattern width and spacing, 0.4 mum pattern height). it was found that biofilm formation and swarming motility of pseudomonas aeruginosa were strongly inhibited by the shark skin pattern plates with a shallow (0.4 mum) pattern height. biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus was also strongly inhibited. live bacteria were located on the pattern rather than in the spacing. when the shape of pattern was a linear ridge instead of shark skin, the antibacterial effects were weaker than seen with the shark skin pattern. the results indicate that the pattern of shark skin is important for decreasing bacterial infection even with a shallow feature height.
wound healing activity of methanolic stem extract of musa paradisiaca linn. (banana) in wistar albino rats.
this study is designed to explore the phytochemical, antibacterial and wound healing activity of methanolic stem extract of musa paradisiaca linn. (banana). the phytochemical analysis was performed for the methanolic stem extract of musa paradisiaca linn. results indicates that the musa paradisiaca linn. was rich in glucosides, tannins and alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids and phenols were present in moderate quantities. the extract shows antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus with the zone of inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 21 mm and staphylococcus aureus was 19 mm at concentration of 500 microg/disc. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was also evaluated for the extract. wistar albino rats were selected for wound healing activity. the burn wound was created by using red hot steel rod from above the hind limb region. the methanolic extract was applied on the wound and the progressive changes were monitored every day. the wound contraction rate was absorbed based on the histopathological examination. it was concluded that the methanolic extract of musa paradisiaca linn. showed greater healing activity compared to control in wistar albino rats.
synthesis and biological evaluation of a new series of n-acyldiamines as potential antibacterial and antifungal agents.
in continuation of our efforts to find new antimicrobial compounds, series of fatty n-acyldiamines were prepared from fatty methyl esters and 1,2-ethylenediamine, 1,3-propanediamine or 1,4-butanediamine. the synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and for their antifungal activity against four species of candida (c. albicans, c. tropicalis, c. glabrata and c. parapsilosis). compounds 5a (n-(2-aminoethyl)dodecanamide), 5b (n-(2-aminoethyl)tetracanamide) and 6d (n-(3-aminopropyl)oleamide) were the most active against gram-positive bacteria, with mic values ranging from 1 to 16mug/ml and were evaluated for their activity against 21 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus. all the compounds exhibited good to moderate antifungal activity. compared to chloramphenicol, compound 6b displayed a similar activity (mic50=16mug/ml). a positive correlation could be established between lipophilicity and biological activity.
functionalization of ethylene vinyl acetate with antimicrobial chlorhexidine hexametaphosphate nanoparticles.
ethylene vinyl acetate (eva) is in widespread use as a polymeric biomaterial with diverse applications such as intravitreal devices, catheters, artificial organs, and mouthguards. many biomaterials are inherently prone to bacterial colonization, as the human body is host to a vast array of microbes. this can lead to infection at the biomaterial's site of implantation or application. in this study, eva was coated with chlorhexidine (chx) hexametaphosphate (hmp) nanoparticles (nps) precipitated using two different reagent concentrations: chx-hmp-5 (5 mm chx and hmp) and chx-hmp-0.5 (0.5 mm chx and hmp). data gathered using dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy indicated that the nps were polydisperse, ~40-80 nm in diameter, and aggregated in solution to form clusters of ~140-200 nm and some much larger aggregates of 4-5 mum. chx-hmp-5 formed large deposits on the polymer surface discernible using scanning electron microscopy, whereas chx-hmp-0.5 did not. soluble chx was released by chx-hmp-5 np-coated surfaces over the experimental period of 56 days. chx-hmp-5 nps prevented growth of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus when applied to the polymer surfaces, and also inhibited or prevented growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa with greater efficacy when the np suspension was not rinsed from the polymer surface, providing a greater np coverage. this approach may provide a useful means to treat medical devices fabricated from eva to render them resistant to colonization by pathogenic microorganisms.
enzymatic elucidation of haemocyanin from kuruma shrimp marsupenaeus japonicus and its molecular recognition mechanism towards pathogens.
haemocyanin is an important non-specific immune protein present in the hemolymph  of invertebrates, which have the ability to recognize the microbial pathogens and trigger the innate immune system. in this study, we isolated and purified the haemocyanin using gel filtration chromatography and investigated its microbial recognition mechanism against the invading pathogens. kuruma shrimp marsupenaeus japonicus haemocyanin showed the single band with a molecular weight of 76 kda on sds-page and its molecular mass was analysed through the maldi. pathogen recognition mechanism of m. japonicus haemocyanin was detected through bacterial agglutination, agglutination inhibition and prophenoloxidase activity. m. japonicus haemocyanin agglutinate all human blood rbc types and showed the bacterial agglutination against all tested gram positive staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis and gram negative pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and vibrio parahaemolyticus at the concentrations ranging from 30 to 50 mug/ml. agglutination was inhibited by 50-200 mm of n-acetylneuraminic acid, a-d-glucose, d-galactose and d-xylose. our results suggest that, 76 kda subunit of m. japonicus haemocyanin recognize the pathogenic surface proteins which are present on the outer membrane of the bacteria and mediates the bacterial agglutination through haemocytes. this bacterial agglutination was visualized through confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). this present study would be helpful to explore the importance of haemocyanin in innate immune response of m. japonicus and its eliciting pathogen recognition mechanism leads to the development of innate immunity in crustaceans.
antimicrobial effects of helix d-derived peptides of human antithrombin iii.
antithrombin iii (atiii) is a key antiproteinase involved in blood coagulation. previous investigations have shown that atiii is degraded by staphylococcus aureus v8 protease, leading to release of heparin binding fragments derived from its d helix. as heparin binding and antimicrobial activity of peptides frequently overlap, we here set out to explore possible antibacterial effects of intact and degraded atiii. in contrast to intact atiii, the results showed that extensive degradation of the molecule yielded fragments with antimicrobial activity. correspondingly, the heparin-binding, helix d-derived, peptide fffaklncrlyrkankssklv (fff21) of human atiii, was found to be antimicrobial against particularly the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy studies demonstrated that fff21 binds to and permeabilizes bacterial membranes. analogously, fff21 was found to induce membrane leakage of model anionic liposomes. in vivo, fff21 significantly reduced p. aeruginosa infection in mice. additionally, fff21 displayed anti-endotoxic effects in vitro. taken together, our results suggest novel roles for atiii-derived peptide fragments in host defense.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamidrazones.
a mild and simple method was developed to prepare a series of fifteen 5-aminoimidazole 4-carboxamidrazones, starting from the easily accessible 5-amino-4-cyanoformimidoyl imidazoles. the antimicrobial activity of these novel amidrazones was screened against gram positive (staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria and candida sp. (candida albicans, candida krusei, candida parapsilosis). only a subset of compounds displayed fair-moderate activity against s. aureus and e. coli but all exhibited activity against candida sp. the three most potent antifungal compounds were further tested against cryptococcus neoformans, aspergillus fumigatus and three dermatophytes (trichophyton rubrum, trichophyton mentagrophytes, microsporum gypseum). these three hit compounds strongly inhibited c. krusei and c. neoformans growth, although their activity on filamentous fungi was very weak when compared to the activity on yeasts.
impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
background: the phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. the current study was performed in order to test the influence of different ast standards on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption. methods: automated ast was performed with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. from each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and mic data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by din and eucast, respectively. in addition cumulative ast data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new eucast mic breakpoints. results: the susceptibility rate of p. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of c. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of e. cloacae, s. marcescens, and m. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from din to eucast mic breakpoints. these changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of eucast mic breakpoints. conclusions: these data show that changes of ast breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption.
staphylococcus aureus alters growth activity, autolysis, and antibiotic tolerance in a human host-adapted pseudomonas aeruginosa lineage.
interactions among members of polymicrobial infections or between pathogens and the commensal flora may determine disease outcomes. pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus are important opportunistic human pathogens and are both part of the polymicrobial infection communities in human hosts. in this study, we analyzed the in vitro interaction between s. aureus and a collection of p. aeruginosa isolates representing different evolutionary steps of a dominant lineage, dk2, that have evolved through decades of growth in chronically infected patients. while the early adapted p. aeruginosa dk2 strains outcompeted s. aureus during coculture on agar plates, we found that later p. aeruginosa dk2 strains showed a commensal-like interaction, where s. aureus was not inhibited by p. aeruginosa and the growth activity of p. aeruginosa was enhanced in the presence of s. aureus. this effect is mediated by one or more extracellular s. aureus proteins greater than 10 kda, which also suppressed p. aeruginosa autolysis and prevented killing by clinically relevant antibiotics through promoting small-colony variant (scv) formation. the commensal interaction was abolished with s. aureus strains mutated in the agr quorum sensing system or in the sara transcriptional virulence regulator, as well as with strains lacking the proteolytic subunit, clpp, of the clp protease. our results show that during evolution of a dominant cystic fibrosis lineage of p. aeruginosa, a commensal interaction potential with s. aureus has developed.
anti-biofilm activity of biogenic selenium nanoparticles and selenium dioxide against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-biofilm activity of biologically synthesized selenium nanoparticles (se nps) against the biofilm produced by clinically isolated bacterial strains compared to that of selenium dioxide. thirty strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were isolated from various specimens of the patients hospitalized in different hospitals (kerman, iran). quantification of the biofilm using microtiter plate assay method introduced 30% of s. aureus, 13% of p. aeruginosa and 17% of p. mirabilis isolates as severely adherent strains. transmission electron micrograph (tem) of the purified se nps (produced by bacillus sp. msh-1) showed individual and spherical nano-structure in the size range of 80-220nm. obtained results of the biofilm formation revealed that selenium nanoparticles inhibited the biofilm of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and p. mirabilis by 42%, 34.3%, and 53.4%, respectively, compared to that of the non-treated samples. effect of temperature and ph on the biofilm formation in the presence of se nps and seo2 was also evaluated.
functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
in this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (amps; pl-5, pl-31, pl-32, pl-18, pl-29 and pl-26), alone or in combination, against three gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis) and three gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. in addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and pl-5 against staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. traditional antibiotics and amps showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro. a strong synergistic effect in the pl-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. the mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of amps and traditional antibiotics. the combination of amps and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections, particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.
biocompatible nanocarrier fortified with a dipyridinium-based amphiphile for eradication of biofilm.
annihilation of bacterial biofilms is challenging owing to their formidable resistance to therapeutic antibiotics and thus there is a constant demand for development of potent antibiofilm agents that can abolish established biofilms. in the present study, the activity of a dipyridinium-based cationic amphiphile (compound 1) against established bacterial biofilms and the subsequent development of a compound 1-loaded nanocarrier for potential antibiofilm therapy are highlighted. solution-based assays and microscopic analysis revealed the antagonistic effect of compound 1 on biofilms formed by staphylococcus aureus mtcc 96 and pseudomonas aeruginosa mtcc 2488. in combination studies, compound 1 could efficiently potentiate the action of tobramycin and gentamicin on p. aeruginosa and s. aureus biofilm, respectively. a human serum albumin (hsa)-based nanocarrier loaded with compound 1 was generated, which exhibited sustained release of compound 1 at physiological ph. the compound 1-loaded hsa nanocarrier (c1-hnc) displayed the signature membrane-directed activity of the amphiphile on target bacteria, efficiently eliminated established bacterial biofilms, and was observed to be nontoxic to a model human cell line. interestingly, compound 1 as well as the amphiphile-loaded hsa nanocarrier could eradicate established s. aureus biofilm from the surface of a foley's urinary catheter. on the basis of its biocompatibility and high antibiofilm activity, it is conceived that the amphiphile-loaded nanocarrier may hold potential in antibiofilm therapy.
antimicrobial activity and agricultural properties of bitter melon (momordica charantia l.) grown in northern parts of turkey: a case study for adaptation.
this study was designed to determine the adaptation capability of bitter melon (momordica charantia l.), which is widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates, in northern parts of turkey. in this study, plant height, number of fruits, fruit length, fruit width, number of seeds and fruit weight of bitter melon grown in field conditions were determined. the antimicrobial effect of the ethanol extract of fruit and seeds against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, aspergillus niger and candida albicans microorganisms was tested in vitro by the disc diffusion method. in conclusion, plant height (260 cm), number of fruits (16 per plant), number of seeds (30.2 per fruit), fruit width (3.8 cm), fruit length (10.6 cm) and fruit weight (117.28 g fruit(- 1)) were determined; fruits were found to have antimicrobial activity against a. niger; oil and seeds were found to have antimicrobial activity against a. niger and e. coli.
bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
photodynamic inactivation of bacterial and yeast biofilms with a cationic porphyrin.
the efficiency of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin tetra-iodide (tetra-py(+)-me) in the photodynamic inactivation of single-species biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans and mixed biofilms of s. aureus and c. albicans was evaluated. the effect on the extracellular matrix of p. aeruginosa was also assessed. irradiation with white light up to an energy dose of 64.8 j cm(-2) in the presence of 20 mum of tetra-py(+)-me caused significant inactivation in all single-species biofilms (3-6 log reductions), although the susceptibility was attenuated in relation to planktonic cells. in mixed biofilms, the inactivation of s. aureus was as efficient as in single-species biofilms but the susceptibility of c. albicans decreased. in p. aeruginosa biofilms, a reduction of 81% in the polysaccharide content of the matrix was observed after treatment with a 20 mum ps concentration and a total light dose of 64.8 j cm(-2). the results show that the tetra-py(+)-me causes significant inactivation of the microorganisms, either in biofilms or in the planktonic form, and demonstrate that polysaccharides of the biofilm matrix may be a primary target of photodynamic damage.
platelet-rich plasma affects bacterial growth in vitro.
background aims: platelet-rich plasma (prp), a blood derivative rich in platelets, is a relatively new technique used in tissue regeneration and engineering. the increased quantity of platelets makes this formulation of considerable value for their role in tissue healing and microbicidal activity. this activity was investigated against five of the most important strains involved in nosocomial infections (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis) to understand the prophylactic role of pure (p)-prp. microbicidal proteins released from activated p-prp platelets were also determined. methods: the microbicidal activity of p-prp and platelet-poor plasma (ppp) was evaluated on different concentrations of the five bacterial strains incubated for 1, 2, 4 and 18 h and plated on agar for 18-24 h. p-prp and ppp-released microbicidal proteins were evaluated by means of multiplex bead-based immunoassays. results: p-prp and ppp inhibited bacterial growth for up to 2 h of incubation. the effect of p-prp was significantly higher than that of ppp, mainly at the low seeding concentrations and/or shorter incubation times, depending on the bacterial strain. chemokine (c-c motif) ligand-3, chemokine (c-c motif) ligand-5 and chemokine (c-x-c motif) ligand-1 were the molecules mostly related to pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis inhibition. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were less influenced. conclusions: the present results show that p-prp might supply an early protection against bacterial contaminations during surgical interventions because the inhibitory activity is already evident from the first hour of treatment, which suggests that physiological molecules supplied in loco might be important in the time frame needed for the activation of the innate immune response.
antibiogram of pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in patients with diabetes.
objective: to determine the antibiogram of pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in patients with diabetes. methods: the study was carried out in the microbiology department of clinical and research laboratory, baqai institute of diabetology and endocrinology (bide) from january 2012 to december 2012. all samples received in the laboratory were processed according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. identification of pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was done and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was determined by disc diffusion method. results: a total of 585 pathogens were isolated from 542 specimens of patients with diabetes. one hundred twenty one (20.68%) pseudomonas aeruginosa and 25(4.27%) non-aeruginosa pseudomonas were detected from 542 samples. among 108 (18%) samples detecting the growth of staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were found in 42 (39%) samples. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked susceptibility to imipenem (100%) followed by piperacillin / tazobactam (90.91%). all mrsa positive specimens were susceptible to vancomycin, but highly or completely resistant to the other antimicrobial drugs. conclusion : in the present study imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and sulbactam-cefoperazone were found to be the most effective drugs against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the majority of mrsa were resistant to one or more than one antimicrobial drugs. vancomycin and imipenem were the most effective drugsagainststaphylococcus aureus and mrsa. .
indolylmethylene benzo[h]thiazolo[2,3-b]quinazolinones: synthesis, characterization and evaluation of anticancer and antimicrobial activities.
a series of novel 10-((1h-indol-3-yl)methylene)-7-aryl-7,10-dihydro-5h-benzo[h]thiazolo[2,3-b]quina zolin-9(6h)-ones (8a-t) have been synthesized in good yields by the reaction of benzo[h]quinazoline-2(1h)-thiones (4a-f) with 2-chloro-n-phenylacetamide (5) followed by knoevenagel condensation with various indole-3-carbaldehydes (7a-d) under conventional method. all the synthesized compounds were characterized by spectral studies and screened for their in vitro anticancer and antimicrobial activities. compound 8c has exhibited excellent activity against mcf-7 (breast cancer cell line) than the standard drug doxorubicin. compound 8d against both the cancer cell lines, 8q against mcf-7 and 8c, 8h against hepg2 have also shown good activity. remaining compounds have shown moderate activity against both the cell lines. antimicrobial activity revealed that, the compound 8q and 8t against staphylococcus aureus and 8i, 8k, 8l, 8q &8t against klebsiella pneumoniae have shown equipotent activity on comparing with the standard drug streptomycin. remaining compounds have shown significant antibacterial and comparable antifungal activities against all the tested microorganisms.
production of silver nanoparticles with strong and stable antimicrobial activity  against highly pathogenic and multidrug resistant bacteria.
aims: to synthesize, characterize, and analyze antimicrobial activity of agnps of escherichia hermannii (she), citrobacter sedlakii (s11p), and pseudomonas putida (s5). methods: the synthesized agnps were examined using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (uv-vis) and, zeta potential, and the size and the morphology obtained from the three different isolates were also confirmed by tem. results: among the three isolates tested, she showed the best antimicrobial activity due to the presence of small (4-12 nm) and stable (-22 mv) agnps. stability of agnps was also investigated and found to be dependent on the nature of isolates. conclusion: produced agnps showed particle stability and antimicrobial efficacy up to 90 days of production. our agnps exhibited greater antimicrobial activity compared with gentamicin against p. aeruginosa isolates and vancomycin against s. aureus and mrsa isolates at very low concentration (0.0002 mg per microliters).
evaluation of cell membrane integrity as a potential antimicrobial target for plant products.
background: there is urgent need to discover new antimicrobial compounds with diverse chemical structures and mechanisms of action due to increasing new and re-emerging infectious diseases. additionally, appearance of undesirable side effects of certain antibiotics and increasing resistance to antibiotics in current clinical use is also a cause for concern. bacterial cell membranes are a possible target for developing new antibacterial drugs since membrane-based efflux pump systems play an important role in bacterial pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. hence, the objective of our study was to evaluate bacterial membrane integrity of two species of bacteria; staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the presence of ethanolic leaf extracts of two plant species callistemon citrinus and vernonia adoensis from zimbabwe. methods: bacterial efflux pump inhibition using both leaf extracts was determined by monitoring the transport of rhodamine 6 g (r6g) across the cell membrane and ic50 values were obtained. membrane permeabilizing properties of both extracts were also evaluated using the membrane potential sensitive dye 3'3 dipropylthiadicarbocyanine (disc3-5). haemolysis effect of both extracts on sheep erythrocytes was also investigated. results: both extracts inhibited bacterial efflux pumps which resulted in the accumulation of r6g inside the cell. the ic50 values for c. citrinus and v. adoensis against s. aureus were 1.44 mg/ml and 1.61 mg/ml, respectively. both leaf extracts however, showed similar ic50 values of 1.64 mg/ml against p. aeruginosa. both plant extracts showed some significant effects on permeability of the bacterial membrane when a 24-28% increase of disc3-5 dye release was observed for s. aureus and 45-53% of dye was released from p. aeruginosa cell membrane after a 60 minute incubation period. in addition, both extracts exhibited haemolytic effects on sheep erythrocytes at concentrations greater than 2.5 mg/ml. conclusions: these plant extracts may provide new lead compounds for developing potential efflux pump inhibitors (epis) or permeabilising agents that could aid the transport of antibacterial agents into bacterial cells.
using the number needed to treat to assess appropriate antimicrobial therapy as a determinant of outcome in severe sepsis and septic shock.
objective: to assess appropriate antimicrobial therapy as an outcome determinant  in severe sepsis and septic shock using the number needed to treat. design: single-center cohort study (january 2008 to december 2012). setting: one thousand two hundred fifty-bed academic hospital. patients: two thousand five hundred ninety-four patients with positive blood culture. interventions: we retrospectively identified patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. inappropriate antimicrobial treatment was defined as an antimicrobial regimen that lacked in vitro activity against the isolated pathogen. information regarding demographics, severity of illness, comorbidities, microbiology, and antimicrobial treatment was recorded. logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for hospital mortality and inappropriate treatment. measurements and main results: seven hundred eighty-seven patients (30.3%) were nonsurvivors. inappropriate antimicrobial treatment had the greatest adjusted odds ratio for hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% ci, 2.8-4.1; p < 0.001). multivariate logistic regression analysis identified resistance to cefepime, resistance to meropenem, presence of multidrug resistance, nonabdominal surgery, and prior antibiotic use as being independently associated with the administration of inappropriate antimicrobial treatment. for the entire cohort, the number needed to treat with appropriate antimicrobial therapy to prevent one patient death was 4.0 (95% ci, 3.7-4.3). the prevalence-adjusted pathogen-specific number needed to treat (pnnt) with appropriate antimicrobial therapy to prevent one patient death was lowest for multidrug-resistant bacteria (pnnt = 20) followed by candida species (pnnt = 34), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (pnnt = 38), pseudomonas aeruginosa (pnnt = 38), escherichia coli (pnnt = 40), and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (pnnt = 47). conclusions: our results support the importance of appropriate antimicrobial treatment as a determinant of outcome in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. our analyses suggest that improved targeting of empiric antimicrobials for multidrug-resistant bacteria, candida species, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and p. aeruginosa would have the greatest impact in reducing mortality from inappropriate antimicrobial treatment in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.
antibacterial efficiency of vermiculite/chlorhexidine nanocomposites and results  of the in vivo test of harmlessness of vermiculite.
clay minerals have been proposed as very useful materials for modulating drug delivery. these are the commonly used materials in pharmaceutical production both as inorganic carriers or active agents. we focused on the development of suitable long-acting material for local treatment of oral infection where clay minerals act as inorganic drug carriers. organovermiculites with antibacterial activity were prepared by ion exchange reactions using different concentrations of chlorhexidine diacetate. the samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (xrd), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) and thermal analysis (tga). the antibacterial activity was evaluated by finding the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). all studied organoclays possessed good antibacterial activity after 24h exposure against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and particularly against staphylococcus aureus. pseudomonas aeruginosa however proved very resistant as only the sample with the highest concentration of ca that successfully inhibited bacterial growth. furthermore, clay mineral vermiculite was subjected to in vivo toxicological analysis and its influence on gastrointestinal tract during its oral application was investigated. tissue samples from buccal mucosa, tongue, esophagus, stomach, terminal duodenum, small intestine, caecum, distal colon and liver were subjected to histological examination, both macroscopically and microscopically. neither systemic nor local reactions were observed. therefore the toxicity of vermiculite to a mammal model organism can be excluded.
high-resolution bacterial growth inhibition profiling combined with hplc-hrms-spe-nmr for identification of antibacterial constituents in chinese plants used to treat snakebites.
ethnopharmacogical relevance: bacterial infection is one of the main secondary infections caused by snakebite. the 88 plant species investigated in this study have been used as folk remedies for treatment of snakebite, and it is therefore the aim of this study to investigate whether the plants contain compounds with bacterial growth inhibition. materials and methods: the water and ethanol extracts of 88 plant species were screened at 200 mug/ml against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa for their antibacterial activity by micro-broth dilution assay. the most active extracts were fractionated into microplates using analytical-scale rp-hplc, and subsequently growth inhibition was assessed for each well. the biochromatograms constructed from these assays were used to identify compounds responsible for antibacterial activity. the structures of five compounds were elucidated by hplc-hrms-spe-nmr. results: crude extracts of boehmeria nivea, colocasia esculenta, fagopyrum cymosum, glochidion puberum, melastoma dodecandrum, polygonum bistorta, polygonum cuspidatum and sanguisorba officinalis showed mic values below 200 mug/ml against either bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the biochromatograms demonstrated that tannins play a main role for the bacterial growth inhibition observed for all above-mentioned plants except for polygonum cuspidatum. furthermore, the high-resolution bacterial growth inhibition profiling combined with hplc-hrms-spe-nmr allowed fast identification of three non-tannin active compounds, i.e., piceid, resveratrol and emodin from ethanol extract of polygonum cuspidatum. conclusion: the high-resolution bacterial growth inhibition profiling allowed fast pinpointing of constituents responsible for the bioactivity, e.g., either showing tannins being the main bacterial growth inhibitors as observed for the majority of the active plants, or combined with hplc-hrms-spe-nmr for fast structural identification of non-tannin constituents correlated with antibacterial activity.
increase in the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter isolates and ampicillin-resistant non-typhoidal salmonella species in korea: a konsar study conducted in 2011.
background: antimicrobial surveillance is important for providing an up-to-date understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance and for creating a forum for rational drug development. in this study, we analyzed antimicrobial test data generated in 2011 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the korean nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance program (konsar). materials and methods: data on the results of susceptibility tests conducted in 32 hospitals and two commercial laboratories were analyzed. data on isolates from patients admitted to an intensive care unit (icu) and those admitted to other wards were compared. intermediate susceptibility was not analyzed and duplicate isolates were excluded. results: escherichia coli was the most prevalent organism identified in both the hospital and commercial laboratories. among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin g-non-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium remained as prevalent as they were in 2009. the proportion of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (vr-efm) slightly decreased from 29% in 2009 to 23% in 2011. resistance rates of klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefoxitin, fluoroquinolone, and amikacin were 24%, 14%, 27%, and 8%, respectively. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and amikacin were 33%, 20%, 22%, and 16%, respectively, whereas those of acinetobacter spp. resistance were 71%, 66%, 64, and 51%, respectively. the prevalence of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa, mrsa, and vr-efm among icu isolates was higher than those among non-icu isolates. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli and k. pneumoniae, imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa, and vr-efm were more prevalent among isolates from commercial laboratories than those from hospitals. resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and amikacin decreased from 32% and 24% in 2005 to 24% and 8% in 2011, respectively. the resistance rate of p. aeruginosa to amikacin decreased from 22% in 2005 to 16% in 2011. the proportion of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased from 16% in 2005 to 64% in 2011. conclusions: the prevalence of mrsa, penicillin g-non-susceptible s. pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant e. faecium among clinical isolates tested in laboratories remained high. multidrug resistance was more prevalent among isolates from icus. the prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant and amikacin-resistant k. pneumoniae and amikacin-resistant p. aeruginosa decreased after 2005, while the prevalence of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased.
in vitro efficacy of n-acetylcysteine on bacteria associated with chronic suppurative otitis media.
background: the safety and efficacy of ciprodex(r) has been demonstrated for treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media (csom). however, symptoms fail to resolve in 9-15% of patients. the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of n-acetylcysteine (nac) on s. aureus, and planktonic and sessile (biofilm forming) p. aeruginosa in vitro using clinical isolates from patients with csom. methods: 1) stability was assessed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for each component in a prepared mixture of ciprodex(r) and nac over 15 days. sterility was assessed by measuring bacterial growth on a blood agar plate. efficacy was assessed using a disc diffusion method by inoculating plates with s. aureus atcc 29513 and p. aeruginosa atcc 27853, and measuring the clearance zone.2) fifteen p. aeruginosa strains were isolated from patients with csom and tested in vitro using the biofilm pa antimicrobial susceptibility assay. treatment solutions included ciprodex(r) & ciprofloxacin +/- nac, and nac alone (0.25%, 0.5% & 1.25%). results: 1) nac combined with ciprodex(r) demonstrated stability, sterility, and efficacy over a two-week period2) p. aeruginosa strains in the sessile (33%-40%) and planktonic (13%) state demonstrated resistance to ciprodex(r) and ciprofloxacin. when nac >/=0.5% was used in isolation or as an adjunct to either of these medications, no resistance was found in the sessile or planktonic state among all 15 strains. conclusion: 1) ciprodex(r) combined with nac has a shelf life of at least two weeks given the documented preservation of stability, sterility, and clinical efficacy of the mixed compounds.2) p. aeruginosa strains demonstrated resistance to both ciprodex(r) and ciprofloxacin. nac >/=0.5% overcomes issues with resistance and shows promise in the treatment of csom.
nanospray technology for an in situ gelling nanoparticulate powder as a wound dressing.
in the current study the feasibility of the novel nano spray drying technique for the production of stable nanoparticulate dry powder, able to gel when administered locally on a wound, is explored. gentamicin sulphate (gs) was loaded into alginate/pectin nanoparticles as highly soluble (hygroscopic) model drug with wide range antibacterial agent for wound dressing. the influence of process variables, mainly spray mesh size and feed concentration, on particle size and morphology, powder wound fluid uptake ability and gelling rate, as well as hydrogel water vapour transmission at wound site were studied. particles morphology was spherical with few exceptions as slightly corrugated particles when the larger nozzle was used. production of spherical nanoparticles (d50 approximately 350 nm) in good yield (82-92%) required 4 mum spray mesh whereas 7 mum mesh produced larger wrinkled particles. nano spray-dried particles showed high encapsulation efficiency ( approximately 80%), good flowability, high fluid uptake, fast gel formation (15 min) and proper adhesiveness to fill the wound site and to remove easily the formulation after use. moreover, moisture transmission of the in situ formed hydrogel was between 95 and 90 g/m(2)/h, an optimum range to avoid wound dehydration or occlusion phenomena. release of the encapsulated gs, monitored as permeation rate using franz cells in simulated wound fluid (swf) was related to particle size and gelling rate. sustained permeation profiles were obtained achieving total permeation of the drug between 3 and 6 days. however, all nano spray-dried formulations presented a burst effect, suitable to prevent infection spreading at the beginning of the therapy. antimicrobial tests against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed stronger and prolonged antimicrobial effect of the nanoparticles compared to pure gs both shortly after administration and over time (till 12 days).
synthesis, anti-microbial and molecular docking studies of quinazolin-4(3h)-one derivatives.
in this work, synthesis, antimicrobial activities and molecular docking studies of some new series of substituted quinazolinone 2a-h and 3a-d were described. starting form 2-aminobenzamide derivatives 1, a new series of quinazolinone derivatives has been synthesized, in high yields, assisted by microwave and classical methods. some of these substituted quinazolinones were tested for their antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa and esherichia coli) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus subtilis), and anti-fungal activity against (aspergillus fumigatus, saccharomyces cervevisiae, and candida albicans) using agar well diffusion method. among the prepared products, 3-benzyl-2-(4-chlorophenyl)quinazolin-4(3h)-one (3a) was found to exhibits the most potent in vitro anti-microbial activity with mics of 25.6+/-0.5, 24.3+/-0.4, 30.1+/-0.6, and 25.1+/-0.5 microg/ml against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and esherichia coli, respectively. compound 3a was found to exhibits the most potent in vitro anti-fungal activity with mics of 18.3+/-0.6, 23.1+/-0.4, and 26.1+/-0.5 microg/ml against aspergillus fumigatus, saccharomyces cervevisiae, and candidaal bicans, respectively.
epidemiology and predictors of multidrug-resistant community-acquired and health  care-associated pneumonia.
there are limited u.s. data describing the risk factors for multidrug-resistant organism (mdro) isolation in community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and health care-associated pneumonia (hcap). however, concern for the presence of these pathogens drives the prescribing of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for cap and hcap. a retrospective study of all adults hospitalized with community-onset pneumonia (cap and hcap) at a large u.s. medical center from january 2010 to december 2011 was conducted. the objective was to ascertain the rate of pneumonia caused by mdros and to evaluate whether hcap is a risk factor for mdro pneumonia. univariate and propensity score-adjusted multivariate analyses were performed. a total of 521 patients (50.5% cap and 49.5% hcap) were included. the most common etiologies of pneumonia were primary viral and streptococcus pneumoniae. mdros were isolated in 20 (3.8%) patients overall, and mdros occurred in 5.9% and 1.9% of hcap and cap patients, respectively. the presence of an mdro was not associated with hcap classification (odds ratio [or]=1.95; 95% confidence interval [95% ci], 0.66 to 5.80; p=0.23) or with most of its individual components (hemodialysis, home infusion, home wound care, and >/=48-h hospitalization in the last 90 days). independent predictors of mdro included the following: pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization/infection in the previous year (or=7.43; 95% ci, 2.24 to 24.61; p<0.001), antimicrobial use in the previous 90 days (or=2.90; 95% ci, 1.13 to 7.45; p=0.027), admission from a nursing home (or=4.19; 95% ci, 1.55 to 11.31; p=0.005), and duration of hospitalization in the previous 90 or 180 days (p=0.013 and p=0.002, respectively). mdros were uncommon in hcap and cap. hcap did not predict mdro isolation. local etiology of community onset pneumonia and specific mdro risk factors should be integrated into therapeutic decisions to prevent empirical overprescribing of antibiotics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and p. aeruginosa.
effectiveness of antimicrobial peptide immobilization for preventing perioperative cornea implant-associated bacterial infection.
titanium (ti) is a promising candidate biomaterial for an artificial corneal skirt. antimicrobial peptide (amp) immobilization may improve the bactericidal effect of the ti substrate. in this study, we tested the bactericidal efficacy of a functionalized ti surface in a rabbit keratitis model. a corneal stromal pocket was created by a femtosecond laser. the ti films were then inserted into the pocket, and staphylococcus aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa was inoculated into the pocket above the implant films. the corneas with ti-amp implants were compared with the corneas implanted with unprotected ti by slit lamp observation and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (as-oct). inflammatory responses were evaluated by bacterium counting, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and immunostaining. there was a lower incidence and a lesser extent of infection on rabbit corneas with ti-amp implants than on those with unprotected ti implants. the bactericidal effect of amp against s. aureus was comparable to that of postoperative prophylactic antibiotic treatment; hence, sesb2v amp bound to the ti implant provided functional activity in vivo, but its efficacy was greater against s. aureus than against p. aeruginosa. this work suggests that sesb2v amp can be successfully functionalized in a rabbit keratitis model to prevent perioperative corneal infection.
[nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2012].
the nationwide surveillance of antibacterial susceptibility to meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates during 2012 in japan was conducted. a total of 2985 strains including 955 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1782 strains of gram-negative bacteria, and 248 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 31 medical institutions were examined. the results were as follows; 1. mepm was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mepm was also active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). 2. of all species tested, there were no species, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous studies in 2009 or 2006. therefore, the tendency to increase in antimicrobial resistance rates was not observed. 3. mepm resistance against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 17.8% (56/315 strains). compared to our previous results, it was the lowest than that in 2006 and 2009. 4. carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and multi-drug-resistant acinetobacter species, which emerged in worldwide, were not observed. 5. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 6.2% (59/951 strains) in enterobacteriaceae, which increased compared with that of our previous studies in 2009 or before. whereas, the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5/315 strains) in p. aeruginosa, which was stable. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem for serious infections treatment at present, 17 years passed after available for commercial use in japan.
polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride shows bactericidal advantages over chlorhexidine digluconate against eskape bacteria.
more information regarding the bactericidal properties of polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (phmg) against clinically important antibiotic-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens needs to be provided for its uses in infection control. the bactericidal properties of phmg and chlorhexidine digluconate (chg) were compared based on their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), minimum bactericidal concentrations, and time-course-killing curves against clinically important antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant eskape pathogens. results showed that phmg exhibited significantly higher bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter spp. than chg. a slight bactericidal advantage over chg was obtained against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, ciprofloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant acinetobacter spp., and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. in previous reports, phmg had higher antimicrobial activity against almost all tested gram-negative bacteria and several gram-positive bacteria than chg using mic test. these studies support the further development of covalently bound phmg in sterile-surface materials and the incorporation of phmg in novel disinfectant formulas.
innate host defense requires tfeb-mediated transcription of cytoprotective and antimicrobial genes.
animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes at the right place and the right time. understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. by using an unbiased approach in the model caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that hlh-30 (known as tfeb in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense. hlh-30 was activated shortly after staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. tfeb was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon s. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. thus, our data suggest that tfeb is a previously unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the host response to infection.
surface functionalization of titanium substrates with chitosan-lauric acid conjugate to enhance osteoblasts functions and inhibit bacteria adhesion.
orthopedic implants failures are generally related to poor osseointegration and/or bacterial infection in clinical application. surface functionalization of an implant is one promising alternative for enhancing osseointegration and/or reducing bacterial infection, thus ensuring the long term survival of the implant. in this study, titanium (ti) substrates were surface functionalized with a polydopamine (pdop) film as an intermediate layer for post-immobilization of chitosan-lauric acid (chi-la) conjugate. chi-la conjugate was synthesized and characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) and hydrogen proton nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectrometer, respectively. lauric acid (la), a natural saturated fatty acid, was used mainly due to its good antibacterial property. scanning electron microscopy (sem) and water contact angle measurements were employed to detect the morphology changes and surface wettability of ti substrates. the results suggested that chi-la conjugate was successfully immobilized onto the surfaces of ti substrates. in vitro tests confirmed that the cell adhesion, cell viability, intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization capacity of osteoblasts were remarkably improved when cultured onto chi-la surface functionalized ti substrates. antibacterial assay against staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) showed that the chi-la modified ti substrates efficiently inhibited the adhesion and growth of bacteria. overall, this study developed a promising approach to fabricate functional ti-based orthopedic implants, which could enhance the biological functions of osteoblasts and concurrently reduce bacteria adhesion.
a novel electrospun membrane based on moxifloxacin hydrochloride/poly(vinyl alcohol)/sodium alginate for antibacterial wound dressings in practical application.
abstract this study reports on the performance of sodium alginate (sa)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (pva)/moxifloxacin hydrochloride (mh) nanofibrous membranes (nfm) capable of providing antibacterial agent delivery for wound-dressing applications. the aim of this work was to prepare antibacterial nfm with good permeability properties by employing pva and sa as carriers. a group of 12% pva/2% sa solutions blended in various ratios (8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5 and 4:6, v/v) and containing 0.5, 1, 2 or 4 wt% mh were studied for electrospinning into nanoscale fibermats. the optimum ratio found to form smooth fibers with uniform fibrous features was 6:4. the drug release behavior of the electrospun, the antibacterial effects on pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and the animal wound dressing capabilities were also investigated. as much as 80% of the mh was released from the electrospun after 10 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. in addition, the nfm with 0.5 mh exhibited less activity, whereas those with higher concentrations of mh exhibited greater antibacterial effect. furthermore, the mh-loaded electrospun accelerated the rate of wound dressing compared to other groups. the results of the in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that mh/pva/sa nanofibers might be an interesting bioactive wound dressing for clinical applications.
effect of methylglyoxal on multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa.
honey has a complex chemistry, and its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity varies with floral source, climate, and harvesting conditions. methylglyoxal was identified as the dominant antibacterial component of manuka honey. although it has been known that methylglyoxal has antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, there is not much information describing its activity against gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we report the effect of methylglyoxal against multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) using 53 clinically isolated strains. we also assessed the effect of deleting the five multidrug efflux systems in p. aeruginosa, as well as the efflux systems in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, on mics of methylglyoxal. our results indicate that methylglyoxal inhibits the growth of mdrp at concentrations of 128-512 mug/ml (1.7-7.1 mm) and is not recognized by drug efflux systems.
green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by rhizopus arrhizus and cunninghamella elegans strains.
this article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by cunninghamella elegans and rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). the physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and x-ray diffraction. the effectiveness of chitosan from c. elegans and r. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). the highest production of biomass (24.60 g/l), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by r. arrhizus. chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cp and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. they both showed identical mic and mbc for all bacteria assayed. these results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.
d-amino acids enhance the activity of antimicrobials against biofilms of clinical wound isolates of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
within wounds, microorganisms predominantly exist as biofilms. biofilms are associated with chronic infections and represent a tremendous clinical challenge. as antibiotics are often ineffective against biofilms, use of dispersal agents as adjunctive, topical therapies for the treatment of wound infections involving biofilms has gained interest. we evaluated in vitro the dispersive activity of d-amino acids (d-aas) on biofilms from clinical wound isolates of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa; moreover, we determined whether combinations of d-aas and antibiotics (clindamycin, cefazolin, oxacillin, rifampin, and vancomycin for s. aureus and amikacin, colistin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and ceftazidime for p. aeruginosa) enhance activity against biofilms. d-met, d-phe, and d-trp at concentrations of >/= 5 mm effectively dispersed preformed biofilms of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa clinical isolates, an effect that was enhanced when they were combined as an equimolar mixture (d-met/d-phe/d-trp). when combined with d-aas, the activity of rifampin was significantly enhanced against biofilms of clinical isolates of s. aureus, as indicated by a reduction in the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (mbic) (from 32 to 8 mug/ml) and a >2-log reduction of viable biofilm bacteria compared to treatment with antibiotic alone. the addition of d-aas was also observed to enhance the activity of colistin and ciprofloxacin against biofilms of p. aeruginosa, reducing the observed mbic and the number of viable bacteria by >2 logs and 1 log at 64 and 32 mug/ml in contrast to antibiotics alone. these findings indicate that the biofilm dispersal activity of d-aas may represent an effective strategy, in combination with antimicrobials, to release bacteria from biofilms, subsequently enhancing antimicrobial activity.
insights on the role of antimicrobial cuffed endotracheal tubes in preventing transtracheal transmission of vap pathogens from an in vitro model of microaspiration and microbial proliferation.
we developed an in vitro model to evaluate the effect of different cuffed endotracheal tubes (etts) on transtracheal transmission of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) pathogens along external surfaces of etts. the model independently assessed the relative contributions of microbial proliferation to the distal tip and microaspiration of contaminated secretions past the cuff by testing in three modes: microaspiration only, microbial proliferation only, and simultaneous microaspiration and microbial proliferation. we evaluated transmission of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) or pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) in the presence of a standard ett; a soft, tapered cuff ett with subglottic suctioning; and a novel antimicrobial gendine (combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine) ett in the model. in the microaspiration only mode, when leakage past the cuff occurred quickly, no ett prevented transmission. when microaspiration was delayed, the gendine ett was able to completely disinfect the fluid above the cuff and thereby prevent transmission of pathogens. in microbial proliferation only mode, the gendine ett was the sole ett that prevented transmission. with both mechanisms simultaneously available, transmission was dependent on how long microaspiration was delayed. potent antimicrobial etts, such as a gendine ett, can make unique contributions to prevent vap when microaspiration is gradual.
comparison of the antimicrobial effect of heavy silicone oil and conventional silicone oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents.
purpose: to conduct an in vitro experimental study comparing the effectiveness of conventional silicone oil and heavy silicone oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents. materials and methods: the antimicrobial activity of conventional silicone oil (rs oil 5000) and heavy silicone oil (heavysil 1500) was tested. the antimicrobial effects of both silicone oils were determined by the growing capability of the microorganism. results: the number of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans decreased to zero levels at the second day of inoculation in heavy silicone oil. in conventional silicone oil, the microorganisms survived longer than in heavy silicone oil. conclusion: heavy silicone oil seems to be more effective than conventional silicone oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents.
drug-resistant ventilator associated pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital in saudi arabia.
background: there is a wide geographic and temporal variability of bacterial resistance among microbial causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). the contribution of multi-drug resistant (mdr) pathogens to the vap etiology in saudi arabia was never studied. we sought to examine the extent of multiple-drug resistance among common microbial causes of vap. materials and methods: we conducted a retrospective susceptibility study in the adult intensive care unit (icu) of king abdulaziz medical city, riyadh, saudi arabia. susceptibility results of isolates from patients diagnosed with vap between october 2004 and june 2009 were examined. the us national healthcare safety network definition of mdr was adopted. results: a total of 248 isolates including 9 different pathogens were included. acinetobacter spp. was highly (60-89%) resistant to all tested antimicrobials, including carbapenems (three- and four-class mdr prevalence were 86% and 69%, respectively). pseudomonas aeruginosa was moderately (13-31%) resistant to all tested antimicrobials, including antipseudomonal penicillins (three- and four-class mdr prevalence were 13% and 10%, respectively). with an exception of ampicillin (fully resistant), klebsiella spp. had low (0-13%) resistance to other tested antimicrobials with no detected mdr. staphylococcus aureus was fully susceptible to vancomycin with 42% resistance to oxacillin. there were significant increasing trends of mdr acinetobacter spp. however not p. aeruginosa during the study. resistant pathogens were associated with worse profile of icu patients but not patients' outcomes. conclusion: acinetobacter in the current study was an increasingly resistant vap-associated pathogen more than seen in many parts of the world. the current finding may impact local choice of initial empiric antibiotics.
ceftobiprole activity against over 60,000 clinical bacterial pathogens isolated in europe, turkey, and israel from 2005 to 2010.
ceftobiprole medocaril is a newly approved drug in europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) (excluding patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia but including ventilated hap patients) and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole against prevalent gram-positive and -negative pathogens isolated in europe, turkey, and israel during 2005 through 2010. a total of 60,084 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates from a wide variety of infections were collected from 33 medical centers. species identification was confirmed, and all isolates were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole had high activity against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (100.0% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% susceptible), with mic90 values of 0.25, 0.12, </= 0.06, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. ceftobiprole was active against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (98.3% susceptible) and methicillin-resistant cons, having a mic90 of 2 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was active against enterococcus faecalis (mic50/90, 0.5/4 mug/ml) but not against most enterococcus faecium isolates. ceftobiprole was very potent against the majority of enterobacteriaceae (87.3% susceptible), with >80% inhibited at </= 0.12 mug/ml. the potency of ceftobiprole against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50/90, 2/>8 mug/ml; 64.6% at mic values of </= 4 mug/ml) was similar to that of ceftazidime (mic50/90, 2/>16 mug/ml; 75.4% susceptible), but limited activity was observed against acinetobacter spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. high activity was also observed against all haemophilus influenzae (mic90, </= 0.06 mug/ml) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, </= 0.06/0.25 mug/ml) isolates. ceftobiprole demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against this very large longitudinal sample of contemporary pathogens.
steady-state hydrogen peroxide induces glycolysis in staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) from human pathogens staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa can be readily inhibited by reactive oxygen species (ros)-mediated direct oxidation of their catalytic active cysteines. because of the rapid degradation of h2o2 by bacterial catalase, only steady-state but not one-dose treatment with h2o2 rapidly induces glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (ppp). we conducted transcriptome sequencing (rna-seq) analyses to globally profile the bacterial transcriptomes in response to a steady level of h2o2, which revealed profound transcriptional changes, including the induced expression of glycolytic genes in both bacteria. our results revealed that the inactivation of gapdh by h2o2 induces metabolic levels of glycolysis and the ppp; the elevated levels of fructose 1,6-biphosphate (fbp) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (kdpg) lead to dissociation of their corresponding glycolytic repressors (gapr and hexr, respectively) from their cognate promoters, thus resulting in derepression of the glycolytic genes to overcome h2o2-stalled glycolysis in s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, respectively. both gapr and hexr may directly sense oxidative stresses, such as menadione.
sarconesiopsis magellanica (diptera: calliphoridae) excretions and secretions have potent antibacterial activity.
the most important mechanism for combating infection using larval therapy depends on larval excretions and secretions (es). the present work was aimed at evaluating sarconesiopsis magellanica (diptera: calliphoridae) es antibacterial activity in six bacterial strains (three gram-positive and three gram-negative) and comparing this to the effect of lucilia sericata-derived es. antibacterial activity at 50mug/ml minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was observed for staphylococcus epidermidis atcc-12228 and staphylococcus aureus atcc-29213 strains, when the turbidimetry test involving s. magellanica es was used; the rest of the bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus atcc-6538, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc-10145, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc-9027 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc-27853) were inhibited at a 100mug/ml mic. twice the amount was required to inhibit the aforementioned bacteria with l. sericata-derived es using this same technique; a similar trend was observed when the agar diffusion method was used instead. furthermore, when the previously established mic for each bacterial strain was used, their colonies became reduced following 1-6h incubation with s. magellanica derived es, whilst the reduction occurred from 2 to 6hours with those from l. sericata. although the mic for each strain obtained with ciprofloxacin was lower than those established when using either blowfly derived-es, the gradual reduction of the colonies occurred at a longer incubation time (6h or more). the results showed that s. magellanica es antibacterial activity was more potent and effective, compared to that of l. sericata-derived es.
anti-staphylococcal activity of c-methyl flavanones from propolis of australian stingless bees (tetragonula carbonaria) and fruit resins of corymbia torelliana (myrtaceae).
propolis of australian stingless bees (tetragonula carbonaria, meliponini) originating from corymbia torelliana (myrtaceae) fruit resins was tested for its antimicrobial activities as well as its flavonoid contents. this study aimed at the isolation, structural elucidation and antibacterial testing of flavanones of c. torelliana fruit resins that are incorporated into stingless bee propolis. flavanones of this study were elucidated by spectroscopic and spectrometric methods including uv, 1d and 2d nmr, ei-ms, esi-ms and hr-ms. the results indicated known c-methylated flavanones namely, 1 (2s)-cryptostrobin, its regioisomer 2 (2s)- stroboponin, 3 (2s)- cryptostrobin 7-methyl ether, and 6 (2s)- desmethoxymatteucinol, and known flavanones 4 (2s)- pinostrobin and 5 (2s)- pinocembrin as markers for c. torelliana fruit resins and one propolis type. ethanolic preparations of propolis were shown to be active against staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923) and to a lesser extent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853). c. torelliana flavanones inhibited the growth of s. aureus therefore contributing to the antibacterial effects observed for australian stingless bee propolis extracts.
amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides: membrane active peptidomimetics and their potential as antimicrobial agents.
we introduce a novel class of membrane active peptidomimetics, the amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides, and evaluate their potential as antimicrobial agents. the design criteria, the building block and oligomer synthesis as well as a detailed structure-activity relationship (sar) study are reported. specifically, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (irras) was employed to investigate structural features of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic air/liquid interface. furthermore, langmuir monolayers of anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids have been used to model the interactions of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular membranes in order to predict their membrane selectivity and elucidate their mechanism of action. lastly, antimicrobial activity was tested against gram-positive m. luteus and s. aureus as well as against gram-negative e. coli and p. aeruginosa bacteria along with testing hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity. we found that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences combine high and selective antimicrobial activity with exceptionally low cytotoxicity in comparison to values reported in the literature. overall, this study provides further insights into the sar of antimicrobial peptides and peptidomimetics and indicates that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides are strong candidates for further development as antimicrobial agents with high therapeutic index.
synthesis, molecular docking and biological evaluation of metronidazole derivatives containing piperazine skeleton as potential antibacterial agents.
metronidazole has a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. hereby a series of novel metronidazole derivatives were designed and synthesized based on nitroimidazole scaffold in order to find some more potent antibacterial drugs. for these compounds which were reported for the first time, their antibacterial activities against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus were tested. these compounds showed good antibacterial activities against gram-positive strains. compound 4m represented the most potent antibacterial activity against s. aureus atcc 25923 with mic of 0.003 mug/ml and it showed the most potent activity against s. aureus tyrrs with ic50 of 0.0024 mum. molecular docking of 4m into s. aureus tyrosyl-trna synthetase active site were also performed to determine the probable binding mode.
use of statistical modeling to reassess the performance standard for the aoac use-dilution methods (955.15 and 964.02).
the aoac use-dilution methods (udm) 955.15 (staphylococcus aureus) and 964.02 (pseudomonas aeruginosa) are laboratory methods used to substantiate antimicrobial efficacy claims for liquid disinfectants on inanimate surfaces. the udm is accepted by the u.s. environmental protection agency for the purpose of product registration. to attain a hospital-level claim, testing against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa is required, and the product must pass against both microbes. currently, the udm's performance standard for a single 60-carrier test is the same for both microbes, and allows up to one positive carrier for the product to be considered as a pass. in this paper, the performance standards for these methods are reassessed using data from a 2009 five-laboratory collaborative study and a recently published statistical model. the reassessment focuses on the pass-error rate for ineffective products and the fail-error rate for highly effective products. the calculations indicate that the pass-error rate is between 9 and 24% and the fail-error rate between 18 and 23% when the current performance standard is used for a single test. for product registration, a smaller pass-error rate (1%) historically has been maintained by requiring that a disinfectant pass three udm tests for each of the two microbes; however, the calculations also indicate that the fail-error rate is between 42 and 45%. this large fail-error rate is a compelling reason to consider a new performance standard for the two udm methods, 955.15 (s. aureus) and 964.02 (p. aeruginosa). one alternative performance standard allows no more than six positive carriers out of 60 as a pass when using p. aeruginosa and no more than three positive carriers out of 60 when using s. aureus. in addition, the new performance standard requires that three udm tests be performed with each of the two microbes, and the disinfectant must pass all six tests to be considered efficacious. the statistical calculations for this alternative performance standard indicate that the pass-error rate is no more than 3%, while the fail-error rate is as small as 5%. based on these error rate calculations, proposed revisions to the performance standards for aoac methods 955.15 and 964.02 are provided.
identification of the phenolic compounds contributing to antibacterial activity in ethanol extracts of brazilian red propolis.
the purpose of this study is to identify the quantity and antibacterial activity  of the individual phenolic compounds in brazilian red propolis. quantitative analysis of the 12 phenolic compounds in brazilian red propolis was carried out using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. the main phenolic compounds in brazilian red propolis were found to be (3s)-vestitol (1), (3s)-neovestitol (2) and (6as,11as)-medicarpin (4) with quantities of 72.9, 66.9 and 30.8 mg g of ethanol extracts(- 1), respectively. moreover, the antibacterial activities of each compound against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentrations. in particular, compound 4 exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity among all the assayed compounds against selected bacteria, indicating that 4 is the most active compound in brazilian red propolis extracts. thus, brazilian red propolis may be used as food additives and pharmaceuticals to protect against bacteria.
toxicity of magnetic chitosan micro and nanoparticles as carriers for biologically active substances.
nanoparticles of inorganic magnetic core surrounded by layers of functional coatings are potential representatives of nanostructures for immobilization of bio-substances. magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) are often bound in aggregates due to a strong magnetic dipole, which has a lot of advantages, such as large surface area for binding biologically active substances. chitosan is a polysaccharide polymer that is non-toxic, hydrophilic, biocompatible and has hydroxy and amino groups in its structure. because of these chemical and biological properties it is a desirable bio-product for immobilization of enzymes and for binding of other biologically active substances. magnetic micro and nanoparticles were synthesized with chitosan by three different methods; microemulsion process, suspension cross-linking technique and covalent binding of chitosan. toxic effect of the prepared magnetic particles was determined as well and was examined on five different bacterial cultures; escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae. at concentrations of 10-30 mg of magnetic particles per 0.5 mcfarland standard solution of e. coli and per 400 cfu of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis in k. pneumonia, no inhibition on the chosen bacterial cultures was detected.
antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of the bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria.
surface-associated marine bacteria are an interesting source of new secondary metabolites. the aim of this study was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine brown alga, bifurcaria bifurcata, and the evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bacteria extracts. the identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) extraction. the antioxidant activity of extracts was performed by quantification of total phenolic content (tpc), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac). antimicrobial activities were evaluated against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida albicans. a total of 39 bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria were isolated and 33 were identified as vibrio sp. (48.72%), alteromonas sp. (12.82%), shewanella sp. (12.26%), serratia sp. (2.56%), citricoccus sp. (2.56%), cellulophaga sp. (2.56%), ruegeria sp. (2.56%) and staphylococcus sp. (2.56%). six (15.38%) of the 39 bacteria bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria presented less than a 90% basic local alignment search tool (blast) match, and some of those could be new. the highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity (against b. subtilis) was exhibited by strain 16 (shewanella sp.). several strains also presented high antimicrobial activity against s. aureus, mainly belonging to alteromonas sp. and vibrio sp. there were no positive results against fungi and gram-negative bacteria. bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria were revealed to be excellent sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
synthesis and biological evaluation of 2-aminobenzamide derivatives as antimicrobial agents: opening/closing pharmacophore site.
a series of new 2-aminobenzamide derivatives (1-10) has been synthesized in good  to excellent yields by adopting both conventional and/or a time-efficient microwave assisted methodologies starting from isatoic anhydride (isa) and characterized on the basis of their physical, spectral and microanalytical data. selected compounds of this series were then tested against various bacterial (bacillus subtilis (rcmb 000107) and staphylococcus aureus (rcmb 000106). pseudomonas aeruginosa (rcmb 000102) and escherichia coli (rcmb 000103) and fungal strains (saccharomyces cerevisiae (rcmb 006002), aspergillus fumigatus (rcmb 002003) and candida albicans (rcmb 005002) to explore their potential as antimicrobial agents. compound 5 was found to be the most active compound among those tested, which showed excellent antifungal activity against aspergillus fumigatus (rcmb 002003) more potent than standard clotrimazole, and moderate to good antibacterial and antifungal activity against most of the other strains of bacteria and fungi. furthermore, potential pharmacophore sites were identified and their activity was related with the structures in the solution.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2006)].
from october 2006 to september 2007, we collected the specimen from 356 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 14 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 414 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 407 strains were examined. the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 64, streptococcus pneumoniae 96, haemophilus influenzae 87, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 52, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, klebsiella pneumoniae 20, and moraxella catarrhalis 44. of 64 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible s. aureus: mssa) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) were 27 (42.2%) and 37 (57.8%) strains, respectively. against mssa, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. against mrsa, vancomycin and linezolid showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. imipenem and faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. in contrast, there were high-resistant strains (mic: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (45.8%) and clindamycin (20.8%). against h. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its mic90 was 0.063 microg/ml or less. meropenem showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its mic90 was 0.5 microg/ml. against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), tobramycin had the most potent activity and its mic90 was 2 microg/ml. against k. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against m. catarrhalis and the mic90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (50.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 49.2% and 28.1% of all the respiratory infections, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. pneumoniae (29.2%), s. aureus (20.8%), and h. influenzae (12.9%). h. influenzae (25.0%) and p. aeruginosa (21.7%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the antibacterial agent administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (27.5%) and h. influenzae (22.5%). the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides was p. aeruginosa, and its isolation frequently was 39.4%.
bloodstream infections in community hospitals in the 21st century: a multicenter  cohort study.
background: while the majority of healthcare in the us is provided in community hospitals, the epidemiology and treatment of bloodstream infections in this setting is unknown. methods and findings: we undertook this multicenter, retrospective cohort study to 1) describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections (bsi) in a network of community hospitals and 2) determine risk factors for inappropriate therapy for bloodstream infections in community hospitals. 1,470 patients were identified as having a bsi in 9 community hospitals in the southeastern us from 2003 through 2006. the majority of bsis were community-onset, healthcare associated (n = 823, 56%); 432 (29%) patients had community-acquired bsi, and 215 (15%) had hospital-onset, healthcare-associated bsi. bsis due to multidrug-resistant pathogens occurred in 340 patients (23%). overall, the three most common pathogens were s. aureus (n = 428, 28%), e. coli (n = 359, 24%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 148, 10%), though type of infecting organism varied by location of acquisition (e.g., community-acquired). inappropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy was given to 542 (38%) patients. proportions of inappropriate therapy varied by hospital (median = 33%, range 21-71%). multivariate logistic regression identified the following factors independently associated with failure to receive appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy: hospital where the patient received care (p<0.001), assistance with >/=3 adls (p = 0.005), charlson score (p = 0.05), community-onset, healthcare-associated infection (p = 0.01), and hospital-onset, healthcare-associated infection (p = 0.02). important interaction was observed between charlson score and location of acquisition. conclusions: our large, multicenter study provides the most complete picture of bsis in community hospitals in the us to date. the epidemiology of bsis in community hospitals has changed: community-onset, healthcare-associated bsi is most common, s. aureus is the most common cause, and 1 of 3 patients with a bsi receives inappropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy. our data suggest that appropriateness of empiric antimicrobial therapy is an important and needed performance metric for physicians and hospital stewardship programs in community hospitals.
next science wound gel technology, a novel agent that inhibits biofilm development by gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens.
loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. such wounds then become chronically infected. topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of next science wound gel technology (nxtsc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. in vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that nxtsc inhibited biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. the gel formulation nxtsc-g5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 cfu/disc or cfu/g. in vivo, nxtsc-g5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. storage of nxtsc-g5 at room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. these results establish that nxtsc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. this novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life, shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.
antibacterial properties of the cftr potentiator ivacaftor.
background: ivacaftor increases cftr channel activity and improves pulmonary function for individuals bearing a g551d mutation. because ivacaftor structurally resembles quinolone antibiotics, we tested the hypothesis that ivacaftor possesses antibacterial properties. methods: bioluminescence, colony forming unit, and minimal inhibitory concentration assays were used to assess viability of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and multiple clinical microbial isolates. results: ivacaftor induced a dose-dependent reduction in bioluminescence of s. aureus and decreased the number of colony forming units. we observed a similar but less robust effect in p. aeruginosa following outer membrane permeabilization. ivacaftor inhibited the growth of respiratory isolates of s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae and exhibited positive interactions with antibiotics against lab and respiratory strains of s. aureus and s. pneumoniae. conclusion: these data indicate that ivacaftor exhibits antibacterial properties and raise the intriguing possibility that ivacaftor might have an antibiotic effect in people with cf.
structure-activity study of macropin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the venom of solitary bee macropis fulvipes (hymenoptera: melittidae).
a novel antimicrobial peptide, designated macropin (mac-1) with sequence gly-phe-gly-met-ala-leu-lys-leu-leu-lys-lys-val-leu-nh2 , was isolated from the venom of the solitary bee macropis fulvipes. mac-1 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, antifungal activity, and moderate hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. a series of macropin analogs were prepared to further evaluate the effect of structural alterations on antimicrobial and hemolytic activities and stability in human serum. the antimicrobial activities of several analogs against pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly increased while their toxicity against human red blood cells was decreased. the activity enhancement is related to the introduction of either l- or d-lysine in selected positions. furthermore, all-d analog and analogs with d-amino acid residues introduced at the n-terminal part of the peptide chain exhibited better serum stability than did natural macropin. data obtained by cd spectroscopy suggest a propensity of the peptide to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical secondary structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol or membrane-mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate. in addition, the study elucidates the structure-activity relationship for the effect of d-amino acid substitutions in mac-1 using nmr spectroscopy.
species-specific viability analysis of pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia and staphylococcus aureus in mixed culture by flow cytometry.
background: bacterial species coexist commonly in mixed communities, for instance those occurring in microbial infections of humans. interspecies effects contribute to alterations in composition of communities with respect to species and thus, to the course and severity of infection. therefore, knowledge concerning growth and viability of single species in medically-relevant mixed communities is of high interest to resolve complexity of interspecies dynamics and to support development of treatment strategies. in this study, a flow cytometric method was established to assess the species-specific viability in defined three-species mixed cultures. the method enables the characterization of viability of pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia and staphylococcus aureus, which are relevant to lung infections of cystic fibrosis (cf) patients. the method combines fluorescence detection by antibody and lectin labeling with viability fluorescence staining using sybrgreen i and propidium iodide. in addition, species-specific cell enumeration analysis using quantitative terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (qt-rflp) was used to monitor the growth dynamics. finally, to investigate the impact of substrate availability on growth and viability, concentrations of main substrates and metabolites released were determined. results: for each species, the time course of growth and viability during mixed culture cultivations was obtained by using qt-rflp analysis in combination with flow cytometry. comparison between mixed and pure cultures revealed for every species differences in growth properties, e.g. enhanced growth of p. aeruginosa in mixed culture. differences were also observed for b. cepacia and s. aureus in the time course of viability, e.g. an early and drastic reduction of viability of s. aureus in mixed culture. overall, p. aeruginosa clearly dominated the mixed culture with regard to obtained cell concentrations. conclusions: in combination with qt-rflp analysis, the methods enabled monitoring of species-specific cell concentrations and viability during co-cultivation of theses strains. experimental findings suggest that the predominance of p. aeruginosa over b. cepacia and s. aureus in mixed culture under the chosen cultivation conditions is promoted by more efficient substrate consumption of p. aeruginosa, and antagonistic interspecies effects induced by p. aeruginosa.
adaptation of pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis airways influences virulence of staphylococcus aureus in vitro and murine models of co-infection.
cystic fibrosis (cf) airways disease represents an example of polymicrobial infection whereby different bacterial species can interact and influence each other. in cf patients staphylococcus aureus is often the initial pathogen colonizing the lungs during childhood, while pseudomonas aeruginosa is the predominant pathogen isolated in adolescents and adults. during chronic infection, p. aeruginosa undergoes adaptation to cope with antimicrobial therapy, host response and co-infecting pathogens. however, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa often co-exist in the same niche influencing the cf pathogenesis. the goal of this study was to investigate the reciprocal interaction of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus and understand the influence of p. aeruginosa adaptation to the cf lung in order to gain important insight on the interplay occurring between the two main pathogens of cf airways, which is still largely unknown. p. aeruginosa reference strains and eight lineages of clinical strains, including early and late clonal isolates from different patients with cf, were tested for growth inhibition of s. aureus. next, p. aeruginosa/s. aureus competition was investigated in planktonic co-culture, biofilm, and mouse pneumonia model. p. aeruginosa reference and early strains, isolated at the onset of chronic infection, outcompeted s. aureus in vitro and in vivo models of co-infection. on the contrary, our results indicated a reduced capacity to outcompete s. aureus of p. aeruginosa patho-adaptive strains, isolated after several years of chronic infection and carrying several phenotypic changes temporally associated with cf lung adaptation. our findings provide relevant information with respect to interspecies interaction and disease progression in cf.
recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
background: bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. lipocalin 2 (lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. this study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. methods: recombinant lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees c. results: results revealed that lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) cfu/ml s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, e. coli, and e. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. at this concentration, lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) cfu/ml staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis. conclusion: recombinant lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
the antimicrobial effects of ketamine combined with propofol: an in vitro study.
background and objectives: ketamine and propofol are the general anesthetics that also have antimicrobial and microbial growth-promoting effects, respectively. although these agents are frequently applied together during clinical use, there is no data about their total effect on microbial growth when combined. in this study, we investigated some organisms' growth in a ketamine and propofol mixture. method: we used standard strains including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans in this study. time-growth analysis was performed to assess microbial growth rates in 1% propofol. antimicrobial activity of ketamine, alone and in propofol was studied with microdilution method. results: in propofol, studied strains grew from 10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml to >/=10(5) cfu/ml concentrations within 8-16 hours depending on the type of organism. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) (for candida, minimal fungicidal concentration) of ketamine were determined as follows (mic, mbc): e.coli 312.5, 312.5 mug/ml; s.aureus 19.5, 156 mug/ml; p.aeruginosa 312.5, 625 mug/ml; and c.albicans 156, 156 mug/ml. in ketamine+propofol mixture, ketamine exhibited antimicrobial activity to e.coli, p.aeruginosa and c.albicans as mbcs at 1250, 625 and 625 mug/ml, respectively. growth of s. aureus was not inhibited in this mixture (ketamine concentration=1250 mug/ml). conclusion: ketamine has sustained its antimicrobial activity in a dose-dependent manner against some organisms in propofol, which is a strong microbial growth-promoting solution. combined use of ketamine and propofol in routine clinical application may reduce the risk of infection caused by accidental contamination. however, one must keep in mind that ketamine cannot reduce all pathogenic threats in propofol mixture.
in vitro activity of plazomicin against 5,015 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals as part of the canward study, 2011-2012.
plazomicin is a next-generation aminoglycoside that is not affected by most clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. the in vitro activities of plazomicin and comparator antimicrobials were evaluated against a collection of 5,015 bacterial isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between january 2011 and october 2012. susceptibility testing was performed using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method, with mics interpreted according to clsi breakpoints, when available. plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with all species except proteus mirabilis having an mic90 of </=1 mug/ml. plazomicin was active against aminoglycoside-nonsusceptible escherichia coli, with mic50 and mic90 values identical to those for aminoglycoside-susceptible isolates. furthermore, plazomicin demonstrated equivalent activities versus extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-esbl-producing e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, with 90% of the isolates inhibited by an mic of </=1 mug/ml. the mic50 and mic90 values for plazomicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa were 4 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively, compared with 4 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively, for amikacin. plazomicin had an mic50 of 8 mug/ml and an mic90 of 32 mug/ml versus 64 multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates. plazomicin was active against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, with both having mic50 and mic90 values of 0.5 mug/ml and 1 mug/ml, respectively. in summary, plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a diverse collection of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci obtained over a large geographic area. these data support further evaluation of plazomicin in the clinical setting.
vellozia flavicans mart. ex schult. hydroalcoholic extract inhibits the neuromuscular blockade induced by bothrops jararacussu venom.
background: snakebite is a significant public health issue in tropical countries. in brazil, some of the most common snake envenomations are from bothrops. bothrops bites trigger local and systemic effects including edema, pain, erythema, cyanosis, infections, and necrosis. vellozia flavicans is a plant from the brazilian "cerrado" (savanna) that is popularly used as an anti-inflammatory medicine. since inflammation develops quickly after bothrops bites, which can lead to infection, the aim of the present study was to observe possible anti-snake venom and antimicrobial activities of v. flavicans (vf). methods: the chromatographic profile of the main constituents from the vf leaf hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by thin-layer chromatography (tlc). the anti-snake venom activity was measured by vf's ability to neutralize the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by bothrops jararacussu venom (bjssu) in a mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm model (pnd). after a 20 min incubation, preparations of pnd were added to tyrode's solution (control); vf (0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml); 40 mug/ml bjssu; pre-incubation for 30 min with bjssu and 1 mg/ml vf; and a bjssu pretreated preparation (for 10 min) followed by 1 mg/ml vf. myographic recording was performed, and the contractile responses were recorded. the antimicrobial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] and minimum bactericidal concentration [mbc]) was obtained for staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, using gentamicin and vancomycin as positive controls. results: tlc analysis yielded several compounds from vf, such as flavonoids (quercetin) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid). bjssu completely blocked the contractile responses of pnd preparations, while vf preserved 97% (+/-10%) of the contractile responses when incubated with bjssu. in the pnd pretreated with bjssu, vf was able to inhibit the neuromuscular blockade progress. mic and mbc of vf ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 mg/ml for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus strains, while no antimicrobial activity was observed for e. coli and e. faecalis. conclusions: the hydroalcoholic extract from vf leaves was able to neutralize and decrease the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by bjssu. however, it did not show significant antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria.
[investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food products].
preservatives are added to food, drugs and other pharmaceutical products to avoid microbial contamination. for antimicrobial activity testing and preservative efficacy testing, vegetative forms of the standard test organisms are used. however, microbial biofilm formation may occur on living tissues, medical implants, industrial or drinking water pipes, natural aquatic systems, glass and plastic surfaces. in our study, it was aimed to determine the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drug, cosmetics and food products and to compare the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (mbic) of microbial biofilm formed on glass surfaces which are commonly used in those areas and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of the planktonic forms. in the study pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, salmonella thyphimurium sl1344, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis nctc 11047, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were used as the standard strains; sodium nitrate, methylparaben, prophylparaben, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate as the preservatives; ampicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, amphotericin b and itraconazole as the antimicrobial agents. mic values were determined through the guidelines of clsi m100-s18 and m27-a3 protocols. biotimer method was used to determine the mbic values. the value of "colony forming unit (cfu)/glass beads" was calculated using the graphics drawn by plotting the time of color change for phenol red or resazurin against log10cfu. all experiments were done with four media at different ph values namely ph: 7, ph: 6.5, ph: 6 and ph: 5.5. according to the results of tests on planktonic forms of the microorganisms, sodium benzoate was determined to be the most effective preservative against all the microorganisms tested except s.aureus and e.faecalis. the most effective preservative against s.aureus and e.faecalis was prophylparaben. prophylparaben was also effective against s.epidermidis. however, in our study it was determined that preservatives were not effective against biofilm forms even if the inoculum was lower, equal to or higher than the inocula of the planktonic forms. the data obtained from this study indicated that preservatives used to prevent microbial contamination in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food products, are not effective against biofilm forms of the microorganisms. this study is thought to be a guide for further studies to be held in the investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food industry.
antimicrobial activity of natural respitol-b and its main components against poultry microorganisms.
poultries are infected to different kinds of microbial infections during their growth. for prevent of these diseases, many farmers use the synthetic antimicrobial agents. whereas, the poultries participate in food cycle of human, the residues of these agents enter in human and cause many undesired side effects. in this study, the antimicrobial activity of respitol-b and its main components (eucalyptus oil and menthol) was evaluated on different kinds of microorganisms including gram positive, gram negative bacteria, yeast and fungi in vitro conditions by disc diffusion and micro broth dilution assays. the gram positive bacteria, yeast and fungi is more sensitive than gram negative ones to respitol-b. pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium is less sensitive to respitol-b. evaluation of menthol and eucalyptus oil for their antimicrobial activities exhibited that the antimicrobial activity of menthol is higher than that of eucalyptus oil. eucalyptus oil had the best effect on vibrio cholerae, staphylococcus aureus, aspergillus flavus but had no effect on others. the antimicrobial activity of menthol is observable and its presence in respitol-b enhances the antimicrobial activity of respitol-b. respitol-b as a 100% herbal drug has antimicrobial effect and can be used as alternative therapy for preventing and controlling of infections.
new cationic antimicrobial peptide screened from boiled-dried anchovies by immobilized bacterial membrane liposome chromatography.
an efficient immobilized bacterial membrane liposome chromatography method was used to screen potential antimicrobial peptides from boiled-dried anchovies. a novel cationic antimicrobial peptide (apep10) was successfully isolated by one-step chromatography. the sequence of apep10 was identified as glarclagtl by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (maldi-q-tof ms). the antimicrobial activity assessment indicated that apep10 inhibited the growth of the reference bacteria (escherichia coli, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae), with minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranging from 8 to 64 mug/ml. almost no cytotoxicity against mouse erythrocytes was observed at concentrations below 20 mug/ml. nucleotide leakage induced by apep10 showed that the peptide exhibited permeable activity on the cytoplasmic membrane. alterations in morphology were observed by scanning electronic microscopy (sem). membrane disruption was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with propidium iodide (pi). the results demonstrate that immobilized bacterial membrane liposome chromatography is a straightforward technique for screening unknown antimicrobial peptides with cell-membrane-interacting activities from boiled-dried anchovies.
antimicrobial function of shbetaap, a novel hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide, isolated from the liver of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis.
a 2.3 kda of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified liver extract of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and c18 reversed-phase hplc. a comparison of the amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with those of other known polypeptides revealed high homology with the c-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain; thus, this peptide was designated as the skipjack hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide (shbetaap). shbetaap showed potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [mecs], 6.5-57.0 mug/ml), gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli d31, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, and two vibrio parahaemolyticus species (mecs, 2.0-19.0 mug/ml), and against candida albicans (mec; 12.0 mug/ml) without significant hemolytic activity. antimicrobial activity of this peptide was heatstable and ph resistant but is sensitive to proteases and salt. shbetaap did not show membrane permeabilization and killing ability. the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling expected that this peptide formed an amphipathic alpha-helical structure. this is the first report the purification of a novel antimicrobial peptide related to the c-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain from marine fish.
gamma-alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5h)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. we have recently reported that some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis. in the present letter we describe results of the biological evaluation of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus mutans. our results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms of s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. in some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/ml (1.3 mum, compound 3d) and 0.7 mug/ml (1.3 mum, 3f). results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.
antibiofilm and antimicrobial efficacy of dispersinb(r)-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel against chronic wound infection associated bacteria.
the medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. as the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of dispersinb((r)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum ksl-w antimicrobial peptide. the combination of dispersinb((r)) and ksl-w peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), and acinetobacter baumannii. in addition, the wound gel formulation comprising dispersinb((r)), ksl-w peptide, and a gelling agent pluronic f-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel silver-sept, dispersinb((r))-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded mrsa, s. epidermidis, cons, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, a. baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < 0.05). thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial dispersinb((r))-ksl-w wound gel in chronic wound management.
resistance surveillance program report for selected european nations (2011).
in the european component of the regional resistance surveillance study for 2011, a total of 21 countries were monitored for antimicrobial resistance patterns including belgium, bulgaria (bu), croatia, czech republic, france (f), germany (ge), greece (gr), ireland (ir), israel (is), italy (it), poland (po), portugal (pt), romania (ro), russia (ru), slovakia (sk), slovenia, spain, sweden (sw), turkey (t), ukraine, and united kingdom. results from testing 12,572 strains (100 [bu] to 1535 [f] per nation) were interpreted by contemporary published breakpoints. samples from 47 hospitals were reference tested against agents such as amikacin (amk), cefoperazone/sulbactam (c/s), colistin (col), levofloxacin, linezolid (lzd), tigecycline (tig), vancomycin (van), and 21 others. among staphylococcus aureus, lzd (mic90, 2 mug/ml), tig (mic90, 0.12 mug/ml), and van (mic90, 1 mug/ml) exhibited complete coverage and methicillin resistance rates among nations (average, 31%) ranged from 0.9% (sw) to 60.0-60.2% (pt, sk). seven lzd-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (only 1.1% resistance overall) were noted in 5 nations, and a staphylococcus simulans strain (mic, 8 mug/ml from ro) had l3 mutations (n130d, g152a, f147s, a157r); also 6 lzd-resistant enterococci were detected in 3 countries (ge, ir, t). van-resistant enterococci (10% overall; 84% vana) were found in 14 countries, highest in ge and ir (23.0%). the esbl phenotype rate for escherichia coli was 20.1% (range, 0.9% [sw] to 70.0-89.7% [bu, ru]), best inhibited by col (100.0% s), tig (100.0%), amk (83.3-94.1%), c/s (81.0%), and carbapenems (>99.0%; resistant strains in is and t). klebsiella spp. had greater esbl rates (45.7% overall, range 2.5-100.0%), as well as carbapenem resistance (8.3% overall, greatest in bu, gr, is, it, po, ro, ru, t). non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter [acb]) were generally less susceptible, except against col (99.2-99.6% s) and tig (95.0% inhibited at </=2 mug/ml; acb only). the following carbapenemases were detected: vim-1 (2 countries); imp-1 (1 from t); kpc-2 or -3 (2 countries); vim-4 (1 from po), ndm-1 (2 in ro; 2 centers); and oxa-48 or -162 (5 from t; 2 centers). european surveillance sampling demonstrates a wide array of resistant isolates, less prevalent among gram-positive cocci that remain inhibited by several available agents. however, beta-lactamase-mediated mechanisms have spread widely among gram-negative bacilli, especially across the eastern and southern european nations, severely limiting infection chemotherapy and necessitating escalated antimicrobial stewardship.
[evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
mucoadhesive chitosan films as a potential ocular delivery system for ofloxacin:  preliminary in vitro studies.
objective: the objective of the study is to evaluate the physical properties, in  vitro release profile, and antibacterial efficiency of chitosan films prepared with ofloxacin. procedure: mucoadhesive films were prepared by means of a casting and solvent evaporation technique performed in a 2 wt% acetic acid solution and distilled water. physical properties were characterized by release and swelling studies, differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) analysis, and attenuated total reflectance fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (atr-ftir) analysis. the in vitro evaluation of the films was performed by inhibiting staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa through activity studies. results: circular ofloxacin-loaded chitosan-developed films with 0.3 mg of drug weighed 7 mg were 110 mum thick and 5 mm in diameter. the dsc curve of ofloxacin-loaded chitosan films suggests an amorphous dispersion of ofloxacin within these films. atr-ftir analysis showed that ofloxacin is indeed present in the matrix film. the drug was released in vitro over a 1-h period. no statistical difference could be observed between the ofloxacin-loaded chitosan films and sterile disk soaked for 1 min in 0.3% commercial ofloxacin ophthalmic solution for s. aureus and p. aeruginosa (p = 0.1686, p = 0.1172, respectively).the films presented a significantly larger mean bacterial inhibition zone of s. aureus than did the commercial ciprofloxacin control disk (p = 0.0002) and a significantly larger mean bacterial kill zone of p. aeruginosa than did the commercial enrofloxacin control disk (p < 0.0001). conclusions: ofloxacin was successively incorporated onto chitosan films and was not inactivated during the process of manufacturing, thus preserving antibacterial proprieties.
identification of staphylococcus aureus alpha-hemolysin as a protein drug that is secreted by anticancer bacteria and rapidly kills cancer cells.
targeted bacterial delivery of anticancer proteins has the ability to overcome therapeutic resistance in tumors that limits the efficacy of chemotherapeutics. the ability of bacteria to specifically target tumors allows for delivery of aggressive proteins that directly kill cancer cells and cannot be administered systemically. however, few proteins have been tested for this purpose. to identify effective molecules, we systematically sorted proteins that have been shown to cause mammalian cell death. the genes for five proteins were selected and cloned into escherichia coli and salmonella. supernatant from cultures of the transformed bacteria was applied to flasks of mcf-7 mammary carcinoma cells to identify proteins that (1) were expressed, (2) secreted, and (3) rapidly killed cancer cells. time-lapse images were taken to visualize mammalian cell morphology. of the investigated proteins, alpha-hemolysin from staphylococcus aureus (sah) was the most promising because it was secreted, caused trauma to cellular membranes, and induced oncosis in 18 min. after exposure for 6 h, sah decreased cell viability by 90%. in comparison, the positive control, pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a (pea), required 11 days to achieve a similar effect, when administered at 3,000 times its lc50 . the maximum death rate induced by sah was calculated to be a reduction in cell viability of 7.1% per min, which was 200-fold faster than the pea control. two proteins, dermonecrotic toxin and phospholipase c were active when extracted from the bacterial cytoplasm but were not secreted. this investigation revealed for the first time sah as a potent anticancer drug for delivery by bacteria because of its ability to be secreted in a fully functional form and aggressively kill cancer cells.
analysis of community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia during a recent 5-year period.
there are sparse data concerning sex- and age-specific characteristics of community-acquired bacteraemia (cab) and hospital-acquired bacteraemia (hab). between january 2008 and december 2012, we identified 2956 bacteraemia cases, which we classified as cab, hab or healthcare-associated bacteraemia (hcab). almost half of the pathogens were escherichia coli in cab patients. by contrast, staphylococcus aureus was most frequent (16.2%) in hab patients. hcab showed mixed features of cab and hab. in cab, e. coli was significantly more abundant in females than in males (56.9 vs 24.3%, respectively). this trend was most striking in young adults (20-39 years) (77.2% in females vs 11.4% in males). hab cases showed greater heterogeneity in their associated pathogens. the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive rates of e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, were 31.3 and 33.8% in hab and 8.8 and 8.4% in cab. the non-susceptibility rates of s. aureus to oxacillin were 37.4% in cab and 73.0% in hab. in conclusion, cab and hab showed different distributions of micro-organisms, and these distributions also differed with patient age and sex. in addition, antimicrobial susceptibility needs to be monitored separately.
could chloramphenicol be used against eskape pathogens? a review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
the widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'eskape' (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acintobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. however, it is still widely used in the developing world. in light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. our paper reviews in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against eskape pathogens. susceptibility patterns for gram-positives were good, although less favorable for gram-negatives. however, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. the risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.
synthesis, and antibacterial activity of novel 4,5-dihydro-1h-pyrazole derivatives as dna gyrase inhibitors.
a series of novel 4,5-dihydropyrazole derivatives (4a-4t), containing the dinitrobenzotrifluoride moiety, as dna gyrase inhibitors were designed and synthesized. based on the preliminary results, compounds 4d, 4f and 4t with potent inhibitory activity in bacterial growth may be wonderful antibacterial agents; among them, compound 4t displayed the most potent activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 3.125, 0.39, 0.39 and 0.39 mug ml(-1) against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli respectively, which was comparable with penicillin and kanamycin b with corresponding mic values of 3.125, 3.125, 0.39, 0.39 mug ml(-1) and 1.562, 1.562, 1.562, 1.562 mug ml(-1), respectively. in particular, compound 4d showed the most potent anti-gram-positive bacterial activity with a mic value of 0.39 mug ml(-1) against the tested gram-positive bacterial strains and exhibited the most potent b. subtilis dna gyrase and s. aureus dna gyrase inhibitory activity with an ic50 of 0.125 mug ml(-1). docking simulation was performed to insert compound 4d into the s. aureus dna gyrase active site to determine the probable binding conformation.
antibacterial activity of 2-alkynoic fatty acids against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
the first study aimed at determining the structural characteristics needed to prepare antibacterial 2-alkynoic fatty acids (2-afas) was accomplished by synthesizing several 2-afas and other analogs in 18-76% overall yields. among all the compounds tested, the 2-hexadecynoic acid (2-hda) displayed the best overall antibacterial activity against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (mic=15.6 mug/ml), staphylococcus saprophyticus (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and bacillus cereus (mic=31.3 mug/ml), as well as against the gram-negative klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8 mug/ml) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic=125 mug/ml). in addition, 2-hda displayed significant antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) atcc 43300 (mic=15.6 mug/ml) and clinical isolates of mrsa (mic=3.9 mug/ml). no direct relationship was found between the antibacterial activity of 2-afas and their critical micelle concentration (cmc) suggesting that the antibacterial properties of these fatty acids are not mediated by micelle formation. it was demonstrated that the presence of a triple bond at c-2 and the carboxylic acid moiety in 2-afas are important for their antibacterial activity. 2-hda has the potential to be further evaluated for use in antibacterial formulations.
triterpenes from euphorbia hirta and their cytotoxicity.
aim: to investigate the chemical constituents of the stems, leaves and roots of euphorbia hirta, and to test for the cytotoxic and antimicrobial potentials of the major constituents of the plant. methods: the compounds were isolated by silica gel chromatography and their structures were elucidated by nmr spectroscopy. the cytotoxicity tests were conducted using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay, while the antimicrobial tests employed the agar well method. results: the air-dried stems of e. hirta afforded taraxerone 1, a mixture of 25-hydroperoxycycloart-23-en-3beta-ol (2a) and 24-hydroperoxycycloart-25-en-3beta-ol (2b) (sample 2) in a 2 : 1 ratio, and another mixture of cycloartenol (3a), lupeol (3b), alpha-amyrin (3c) and beta-amyrin (3d) (sample 3) in a 0.5 : 4 : 1 : 1 ratio. the air-dried leaves of e. hirta yielded sample 2 in a 3 : 2 ratio, sample 3 in a 2 : 3 : 1 : 1 ratio, phytol and phytyl fatty acid ester, while the roots afforded sample 2 in a 2 : 1 ratio, sample 3 in a 2 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio, a mixture of cycloartenyl fatty acid ester 4a, lupeol fatty acid ester 4b, alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester 4c and beta-amyrin fatty acid ester 4d (sample 4) in a 3 : 2 : 1 : 1 ratio, linoleic acid, beta-sitosterol and squalene. compound 1 from the stems, sample 2 from the leaves, and sample 3 from the stems were assessed for cytotoxicity against a human cancer cell line, colon carcinoma (hct 116). sample 2 showed good activity with an ic50 value of 4.8 mug.ml(-1), while 1 and sample 3 were inactive against hct 116. sample 2 was further tested for cytotoxicity against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (a549). it showed good activity against this cell line with an ic50 value of 4.5 mug.ml(-1). antimicrobial assays were conducted on 1 and sample 2. results of the study indicated that 1 was active against the bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, but was inactive against escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. sample 2 was active against the bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli and fungi: candida albicans and trichophyton mentagrophytes. it was inactive against bacillus subtilis and aspergillus niger. conclusions: the triterpenes: 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d were obtained from the stems, roots and leaves of e. hirta. taraxerol (1) was only isolated from the stems, the leaves yielded phytol and phytyl fatty acid esters, while the roots afforded 4a-4d, linoleic acid, beta-sitosterol, and squalene. triterpene 1 and sample 2 were found to exhibit antimicrobial activities. thus, these compounds are some of the active principles of e. hirta which is used in wound healing and the treatment of boils. the cytotoxic properties of sample 2 imply that triterpenes 2a and 2b contribute to the anticancer activity of e. hirta.
cationic, anionic and neutral dyes: effects of photosensitizing properties and experimental conditions on the photodynamic inactivation of pathogenic bacteria.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the photobactericidal effect of four photosensitizers (pss) with different structural and physico-photochemical properties, namely mesotetracationic porphyrin (t4mpyp), dianionic rose bengal (rb), monocationic methylene blue (mb) and neutral red (nr). their photokilling activity was tested in vitro on pathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) suspended in nutrient broth (nb) and in phosphate buffered saline (pbs) through following their influence on the pss antimicrobial efficacy. photodynamic inactivation (pdi) experiments were performed using visible light (l) and different pss concentrations (20-70 mum). the ability of these pss to mediate bacterial photodynamic inactivation was investigated as a function of type of ps and its concentrations, spectral and physico-chemical properties, bacterial strain, irradiation time and suspending medium. indeed, they showed antibacterial effects against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa with significant difference in potency. staphylococcus aureus suspended in nb showed 0.92 log units reduction in viable count in the presence of t4mpyp at 20 mum. changing the suspending medium from nb to pbs, s. aureus was successfully photoinactivated by t4mpyp (20 mum) when suspended in pbs at least time exposure (10 and 30 min), followed by mb and rb.
synergy of antibacterial and antioxidant activities from crude extracts and peptides of selected plant mixture.
background: a plant mixture containing indigenous australian plants was examined  for synergistic antimicrobial activity using selected test microorganisms. this study aims to investigate antibacterial activities, antioxidant potential and the content of phenolic compounds in aqueous, ethanolic and peptide extracts of plant mixture. methods: well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) assays were used to test antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacteria namely staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. dpph (2, 2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl) and superoxide dismutase (sod) assays were used to evaluate antioxidant activity. hplc and gel filtration were used for purification of the peptides. scanning electron microscope was applied to investigate the mode of attachment of the peptides on target microbial membranes. results: aqueous extraction of the mixture showed no inhibition zones against all the test bacteria. mean diameter of inhibition zones for ethanol extraction of this mixture attained 8.33 mm, 7.33 mm, and 6.33 mm against s. aureus at corresponding concentrations of 500, 250 and 125 mg/ml while e .coli showed inhibition zones of 9.33 mm, 8.00 mm and 6.66 mm at the same concentrations. b. cereus exhibited inhibition zones of 11.33 mm, 10.33 mm and 10.00 mm at concentrations of 500, 250 and 125 mg/ml respectively. the peptide extract demonstrated antibacterial activity against s. aureus, e. coli and b. cereus. the mic and mbc values for ethanol extracts were determined at 125 mg/ml concentration against s. aureus and e. coli and b. cereus value was 31.5 mg/ml. mic and mbc values showed that the peptide extract was significantly effective at low concentration of the australian plant mixture (apm). phenolic compounds were detected in hot aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the plant mixture. hot aqueous, ethanol and peptides extracts also exhibited antioxidant activities. conclusions: it was concluded that apm possessed good antibacterial and antioxidant activities following extraction with different solvents. the results suggest that apm provide a new source with antibacterial agents and antioxidant activity for nutraceutical or medical applications.
in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates collected from the middle east and africa between 2004 and 2011.
the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. in this study, susceptibility among gram-positive and gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the middle east and africa was examined. antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) interpretive criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution methods. us food and drug administration (fda)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. in total, 2967 gram-positive and 6322 gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. all staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant s. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. all enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of escherichia coli and 32.9% of klebsiella pneumoniae. more than 95% of e. coli and enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. the most active agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2% susceptible), respectively; the mic90 (mic required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against a. baumannii was low at 2mg/l. tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most gram-negative pathogens. tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most gram-positive pathogens from the middle east and africa.
antimicrobial activity of extracts from in vivo and in vitro propagated lamium album l. plants.
the antimicrobial activity of 18 different extracts from in vivo and in vitro grown l. album l. plants was evaluated against clinical bacteria and yeasts using the well diffusion method. all the used extracts demonstrated antibacterial activity, whereas only the water extracts from leaves (in vivo) possessed antifungal activity against candida albicans nbimcc 72 and candida glabrata nbimcc 8673 (14 and 20 mm diameter of inhibition zones and mic 10 mg/ml, respectively). the methanol and ethanol extracts obtained from the in vitro propagated plants had a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity than those from in vivo plants, while the opposite tendency was observed for the chloroform extracts. all tested flower extracts possessed antimicrobial activity. the chloroform extract from in vivo flowers demonstrated the highest activity against e. faecalis nbimcc 3915, s. aureus nbimcc 3703, p. hauseri nbimcc 1339 and p. aeruginosa nbimcc 3700 (22 mm, 13 mm, 11 mm, 23 mm zone diameter of inhibition and mic 0.313 mg/ml, respectively). the water extracts from leaves (both in vivo and in vitro) possessed higher antibacterial activity than extract from flowers. the obtained results showed that both in vivo and in vitro propagated l. album l. could be used as a source of antibacterial substances.
antimicrobial and antiplasmodial activities of a quaternary compound from ritchiea capparoides var. longipedicellata.
the leaves of ritchiea capparoides var. longipedicellata (capparidaceae) is used  in ethnomedicine in south-western nigeria to treat infectious and parasitic diseases. this study was aimed at identifying the compound(s) that are responsible for the antimicrobial and antiplasmodial activities of the leaves and also to contribute to the chemistry of the plant species. a 70 % aqueous ethanolic extract of the leaves of r. longipedicellata was subjected to repeated liquid chromatographic methods on silica gel, lobar rp-18 column and sephadex lh-20 to isolate a draggendorf positive compound. the compound was identified by (1)h and (13)c nmr, ultra-violet spectroscopy and polarimetry. the antimicrobial activity of the compound was evaluated using the microbroth dilution method while the antiplasmodial activity was carried out according to trager and jenson (1976). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was expressed in mg/ml. the isolated compound, leavoisomer of stachydrine, inhibited the growth of escherichia coli nctc 8196 and staphylococcus aureus nctc 6571 at the mic of 5 mg/ml. in the anti-malaria assay, the compound had inhibitory activity with the concentration required to cause 100% lethality being 0.667 mg/ml. conclusion: the antibacterial and antiparasitic effects of quaternary ammonium compounds are well documented. however, this study is the first report of the presence and biological activities of this compound in this plant species which may justify the ethnomedicinal uses of the leaves.
prevention of staphylococcus aureus infections by glycoprotein vaccines synthesized in escherichia coli.
background: staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of superficial and invasive  human disease that is often refractory to antimicrobial therapy. vaccines have the potential to reduce the morbidity, mortality, and economic impact associated with staphylococcal infections. however, single-component vaccines targeting s. aureus have failed to show efficacy in clinical trials. methods: a novel glycoengineering technology for creation of a multicomponent staphylococcal vaccine is described. genes encoding s. aureus capsular polysaccharide (cp) biosynthesis, pglb (a campylobacter oligosaccharyl transferase), and a protein carrier (detoxified pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein a or s. aureus alpha toxin [hla]) were coexpressed in escherichia coli. recombinant proteins n-glycosylated with s. aureus serotype 5 or 8 cps were purified from e. coli. results: rabbits and mice immunized with the glycoprotein vaccines produced antibodies that were active in vitro in functional assays. active and passive immunization strategies targeting the cps protected mice against bacteremia, and vaccines targeting hla protected against lethal pneumonia. the cp-hla bioconjugate vaccine protected against both bacteremia and lethal pneumonia, providing broad-spectrum efficacy against staphylococcal invasive disease. conclusions: glycoengineering technology, whereby polysaccharide and protein antigens are enzymatically linked in a simple e. coli production system, has broad applicability for use in vaccine development against encapsulated microbial pathogens.
in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s. salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
manuka honey inhibits adhesion and invasion of medically important wound bacteria in vitro.
aim: to characterize the effect of manuka honey on medically important wound bacteria in vitro, focusing on its antiadhesive properties. materials & methods: crystal violet biofilm assays, fluorescent microscopy, protein adhesion assay and gentamicin protection assay were used to determine the impact of manuka honey on biofilm formation, human protein binding and adherence to/invasion into human keratinocytes. results: manuka honey effectively disrupted and caused extensive cell death in biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes. sublethal doses of manuka honey inhibited bacterial adhesion to the fibronectin, fibrinogen and collagen. manuka honey impaired adhesion of laboratory and clinical isolates of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and s. pyogenes to human keratinocytes in vitro, and inhibited invasion by s. pyogenes and homogeneous vancomycin intermediate s. aureus. conclusion: manuka honey can directly affect bacterial cells embedded in a biofilm and exhibits antiadhesive properties against three common wound pathogens.
susceptibility of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus to photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy with alpha-d-galactopyranosyl zinc phthalocyanines: in vitro study.
the incidence of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is increasing globally, making urgent the discovery of novel alternative therapies for infections. photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (pact), based on oxidative damage to subcellular structures, has the advantage of circumventing multidrug resistance, and is becoming a potential therapeutic modality for methicillin-resistant bacteria. the key to pact is photosensitization. this study demonstrates the efficiency of pact using alpha-d-galactopyranosyl zinc phthalocyanines (t1-t4) for the photosensitization of mrsa, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. bacterial suspensions were illuminated with 650-nm light from a semiconductor laser at 0.2 w/cm(2), and the energy density was maintained at 6 j/cm(2) in the presence of different concentrations of photosensitizer. the treatment response was evaluated based on the numbers of bacterial colony-forming units. pact with these phthalocyanines strongly affected mrsa, but weakly affected e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the efficiency of pact on mrsa with these four phthalocyanine compounds decreased in the order t1 > t2 > t3 > t4. t1-pact eliminated >99% of mrsa in a concentration range of 25-50 mum and at an energy density of 6 j/cm(2). uptake measurements revealed that the pact effect correlated with the bacterial uptake of the photosensitizer and that 4-30-fold more t1 than t2-t4 was taken up by the mrsa strain, which was confirmed with laser confocal microscopy. these data suggest that t1 is an efficient pact photosensitizer for mrsa.
isolation and bioassay screening of medicinal plant endophytes from eastern canada.
eighty-one distinct fungal endophytes were isolated from 12 traditionally used medicinal plants from new brunswick, canada. this is the first report of endophytes from 8 of the 12 host plants. one hundred and sixty-two crude extracts derived from the mycelia and spent fermentation broths of liquid cultures of each endophyte were screened for antibacterial and antifungal activity. twenty-two extracts were active against staphylococcus aureus while 30 were active against pseudomonas aeruginosa. twelve crude extracts were found to be active against candida albicans.
exploration of structure-based on imidazole core as antibacterial agents.
imidazole, a five-membered heterocycle having three carbon atoms, and two double  bonds, having efficient antibacterial escherichia coli, bacillus subtili, bacillus proteus, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and helicobacter pyloriurease etc, shows a broad-spectrum of antibacterial activities. to search new antibacterial drugs to overcome resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics, to date hundreds of this sort of derivatives have been synthesized and possess potent antibacterial activity. as the structure of imidazole derivatives is various, the target of antibacterial is also diverse including beta-lactamases, beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii (fabh), dna gyrase and topoisomerase, glutamate racemase and urease. in this review, we will discuss the emergence of resistance to antibiotics and attempt to summarize the main developments of imidazole derivatives in the past ten years. we hope that increasing knowledge of the structure-activity relationship (sar) will be beneficial to the rational design of new generation of small molecule antibacterial drugs.
antimicrobial efficacy of mineral trioxide aggregate with and without silver nanoparticles.
introduction: most current root-end filling materials do not provide a perfect seal. thus, a microscopic space is likely to exist in the interface between walls of the root-end cavity and filling material, which allows microorganisms and their products to penetrate. in addition to good sealing ability and biocompatibility, root-end filling materials should ideally have some antimicrobial activity. therefore, this in vitro study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of angelus white mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and the mixture of mta with silver nanoparticles (1% weight; mta/sn). materials and methods: antimicrobial properties of mta and mta/sn were tested by agar diffusion technique against enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. the microbial inhibition zones around the materials were measured by a caliper with 0.1-mm accuracy. student's t-test was used for comparison between the two groups in normal data distribution and man-whitney u test for non-normal distribution. results: student's t-test revealed that for e. faecalis, c. albicans, and p. aeruginosa, microbial inhibition zone of mta/sn was significantly greater than that of mta (p = 0.000). mann-whitney u test indicated no significant difference between the effect of mta and mta/sn on s. aureus (p > 0.05). conclusion: based on the results of this study, adding silver nanoparticles to mta improved its antimicrobial efficacy.
effect of chain elongation on biological properties of the toxin paralysin beta-alanyl-tyrosine.
in hemolymph of insect species, compounds with remarkable properties for pharmaceutical industry are present. at the first line, there were found compounds of low molecular mass, less than 1 kda. one of such compounds, beta-alanyl-tyrosine (252 da), was isolated from larval hemolymph of some species of holometabolous insects (e.g. neobellieria bullata). its paralytic activity and antimicrobial properties were described until now. in this study, we present the effect of elongation of beta-alanyl-tyrosine by repeating of this motive on the biological and physical properties of prepared analogues. for assessment of antimicrobial properties of these new compounds strains of gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria and fungi were used, we also followed the haemolytic activity and toxic effect on human cell culture hepg2. on the base of ecd spectroscopy measurement, subsequent molecular modelling and known secondary structure of original beta-alanyl-tyrosine dipeptide, the secondary structures of repeating sequences of beta-ay were specified. the repeating structures of beta-alanyl-tyrosine show increase in antimicrobial activity; for escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, minimal inhibitory concentration was decreased from 30 to 15 mm for 2xbeta-ay, 0.4 mm for 4xbeta-ay and 0.25 mm for 6xbeta-ay.
green synthesis of silver nanoparticles, their characterization, application and  antibacterial activity.
our research focused on the production, characterization and application of silver nanoparticles (agnps), which can be utilized in biomedical research and environmental cleaning applications. we used an environmentally friendly extracellular biosynthetic technique for the production of the agnps. the reducing agents used to produce the nanoparticles were from aqueous extracts made from the leaves of various plants. synthesis of colloidal agnps was monitored by uv-visible spectroscopy. the uv-visible spectrum showed a peak between 417 and 425 nm corresponding to the plasmon absorbance of the agnps. the characterization of the agnps such as their size and shape was performed by atom force microscopy (afm), and transmission electron microscopy (tem) techniques which indicated a size range of 3 to 15 nm. the anti-bacterial activity of agnps was investigated at concentrations between 2 and 15 ppm for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. staphylococcus aureus and kocuria rhizophila, bacillus thuringiensis (gram-positive organisms); escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium (gram-negative organisms) were exposed to agnps using bioscreen c. the results indicated that agnps at a concentration of 2 and 4 ppm, inhibited bacterial growth. preliminary evaluation of cytotoxicity of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles was accomplished using the inq cell research system instrument with hek 293 cells. this investigation demonstrated that silver nanoparticles with a concentration of 2 ppm and 4 ppm were not toxic for human healthy cells, but inhibit bacterial growth.
triterpenoids from gutenbergia nigritana(benth). oliv and hiern.
gutenbergia nigritana (benth). oliv and hein (asteraceae) is a nigerian ethnomedicinal plant which has long being used medicinally in traditional systems of medicine. the plant has diverse ethnomedicinal uses which include: the plant is used in the ijaw area of niger delta region of nigeria to treat malaria, convulsion, diarrhea and as a remedy for skin infection. the antibacterial study on dichloromethane extract and chromatographic fractions:dichloromethane soluble part(dc1), ethyl acetate soluble part(e1) and n-butanol soluble portions of methanolic extract were investigated using agar diffusion assay method by measuring the zone of inhibition against clinical isolates: bacillus subtillis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. extensive chromatographic separation and preparative tlc were employed in the isolation steps. column chromatograpy of the dichloromethane extract, gel filteration on sephadex and preparative tlc led to the isolation of two triterpenoids: lupenol(1) and lupenol acetate(2). the structures were elucidated by nmr spectroscopy and compared with literature. the dichloromethane extract exhibited antibacterial activity against all the test microorganisms with zones of inhibition ranging between 12-26mm. the chromatographic fraction (fr-6) exhibited activity against e. coli, ps. aeruginosa and s. aureus but in-active against b. subtilis, while the methanol soluble portions: dichloromethane and ethyl acetate showed weak activity while the n-butanol portion was in active. dichloromethane extract of gutenbergia nigritana leaves exhibited anti-bacterial activity, though the compounds isolated did not show activity, it is likely that the activity might reside in other components present in the dichloromethane extract.

purpose: contact lenses that incorporate antimicrobial properties may reduce the  risk for microbial-associated adverse events for lens wearers. the aim of this study was to assess the antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles (np) when impregnated in a hydrogel material. methods: hydrogel disks, used as a proxy for soft contact lenses, were prepared with silver nps to add an antimicrobial effect to the polymer. six groups of disks were created, each with a different concentration of silver nps. the antimicrobial effect of the hydrogels against pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc15442) and staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538) was evaluated at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h. results: silver np concentrations ranged from 20.71 to 98.06 mug/disk. all groups demonstrated excellent antibacterial effects against p. aeruginosa at each time point. after 6h all disks didn't exhibit desirable antibacterial activity against s. aureus; whereas except those with 20.71 mug silver nps showed antibacterial activity at 24h and only the disks with 57.13 and 98.06 mug silver nps showed antimicrobial activity at 48 and 72 h. conclusions: the development of contact lenses made of a silver np-impregnated hydrogel material may bring antimicrobial effects sufficient to decrease the risk of microbial-related adverse events for lens wearers.
a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60 mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
antimicrobial activity and sar study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
a series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. they were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida krusei, and candida albicans. in this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). then, we present a sar study for staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the dominance-based rough set approach (drsa), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. the sar study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.

antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of some 2-amino-5-alkylidene-thiazol-4-ones.
we report a small, focused library of 30 diverse 2-amino-5-alkylidene-thiazol-4-ones that was assayed in a whole-cell antibacterial screen against a panel of several bacterial strains and a yeast. most of the compounds exhibited modest to significant antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, and no activity against salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli. the antibacterial activity depends markedly upon substituents on the thiazol-4-one core, and the most potent compound assayed ([formula: see text]-4-((2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-4-oxothiazol-5(4h)-ylidene)methyl)benzonitri le) reached a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) value of [formula: see text] on p. aeruginosa strain. an important feature of the tested compounds is their low influence on cell viability, as determined in a hek-293 metabolic activity assay. in light of the encouraging in vitro antimicrobial assay results against several bacterial strains, we have generated a pharmacophore model using the discovery studio 3.0 package (accelrys inc., san diego, usa), which exposed the spatial arrangement of key molecular properties responsible for our observed mic results. considering the absence of a defined target and the limitation of the described approach to pool different scaffolds, the calculated pharmacophore model could be used for library enrichment to identify compounds with a thiazolidinone scaffold with improved antimicrobial potency and physico-chemical properties.
microwave assisted synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones;  synthesis, in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer activities of novel coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones.
the present article describes the synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (2a-h) under microwave irradiation. the product was obtained in excellent yield (74-94%) in a shorter reaction time (2 min). these molecules (2a, b) further reacted with various substituted 4-bromomethylcoumarins (3a-f) to yield a new series of coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones (4a-h). the structure of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral studies and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three gram-positive bacteria viz., staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and three gram-negative bacteria viz., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against candida albicans, aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus flavus, fusarium oxysporum, penicillium chrysogenum and anticancer activity against dalton's ascitic lymphoma (dal) cell line. in general, all the compounds possessed better antifungal properties than antibacterial properties. the coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (4g) (r = i-pr, r(1) = 6-cl) was found to be the most potent cytotoxic compound (88%) against dalton's ascitic lymphoma cell line at the concentration of 100 mug/ml.
antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.
role of size and shape on biofilm eradication for nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles.
nitric oxide (no), a reactive free radical, has proven effective in eradicating bacterial biofilms with reduced risk of fostering antibacterial resistance. herein, we evaluated the efficacy of no-releasing silica nanoparticles against gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive staphylococcus aureus biofilms as a function of particle size and shape. three sizes of no-releasing silica nanoparticles (i.e., 14, 50, and 150 nm) with identical total no release ( approximately 0.3 mumol/mg) were utilized to study antibiofilm eradication as a function of size. to observe the role of particle shape on biofilm killing, we varied the aspect ratio of the no-releasing silica particles from 1 to 8 while maintaining constant particle volume ( approximately 0.02 mum(3)) and no-release totals ( approximately 0.7 mumol/mg). nitric oxide-releasing particles with decreased size and increased aspect ratio were more effective against both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus biofilms, with the gram-negative species exhibiting the greatest susceptibility to no. to further understand the influence of these nanoparticle properties on no-mediated antibacterial activity, we visualized intracellular no concentrations and cell death with confocal microscopy. smaller no-releasing particles (14 nm) exhibited better no delivery and enhanced bacteria killing compared to the larger (50 and 150 nm) particles. likewise, the rod-like no-releasing particles proved more effective than spherical particles in delivering no and inducing greater antibacterial action throughout the biofilm.
evaluation of antimicrobial activity of bauhinia purpurea leaves under in vitro conditions.
this study was undertaken with an objective of testing the antibacterial and antifungal activities of bauhinia purpurea leaves and identifying the bioactive compounds. the antimicrobial activity of leaf extract was determined in aqueous and organic extracts and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against six species of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans using the disk diffusion method. the chemical constituents of organic plant extract were separated by thin layer chromatography and purified by column chromatography and further identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis. significant inhibitory activity was observed with methanol extracts of plant against the test microorganisms while less antibacterial activity was observed in hexane, acetone and aqueous extracts. mic of b. purpurea extract was </=1,500 mug/ml against s. aureus and b. subtilis while this extract showed no inhibition against gram-negative s. typhi, e. coli and p. aeruginosa or against fungus c. albicans. eleven compounds were identified in b. purpurea leaf extract by gc-ms analysis. the composition of b. purpurea revealed the presence of lupeol, stigmasterol, lanosterol, ergosterol, beta-tocopherol, phytol, hexadeconic acids, hexadeconic acids methyl esters, octadecadienoic acids and octadecatrienoic acid. stigmasterol and lupeol were the most abundant (34.48 and 15.63 %). other phytosterols like lanosterol (4.15 %) and ergosterol (2.82 %) were also found to be present in this extract.
comparison on conjunctival sac bacterial flora of the seniors with dry eye in ganzi autonomous prefecture.
aim: to compare the bacterial flora in palpebral conjunctiva of xerophthalmia seniors of tibetan, yi and han, and analyze the differences and similarities of the bacteria. methods: the test subjects were selected from 2 tibetan, 2 yi and 3 han populated places, respectively. total 222 seniors (444 eyes) with dry eye were examined. secretion was collected from the palpebral conjunctiva of the subjects and then inoculated onto a blood agar plate. after 48h of incubation, the bacteria were examined for the differences and similarities between different ethnics. results: there was no significant difference (p>0.05) of gram stain characterization, dominant bacteria and number of the bacterial species present in oxrophthalmia patients among tibetan, yi and han nationalities. the bacteria presented in all groups include staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa. the bacteria detected from the two of three ethnic groups were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae, and staphylococcus heads. the incidence rate of bacteria-associated dry eye in tibetan population was significantly lower than that of han and yi population. conclusion: there is no significant difference in the bacteria flora of palpebral conjunctiva observed among dry eye elder populations of tibetan, yi and han people. all of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae and staphylococcus heads are common bacteria flora of the three nationalities inhibiting in this area.
the effects of preservation procedures on antibacterial property of amniotic membrane.
amniotic membrane (am), the innermost layer of the fetal membranes, has been widely employed in the surgical reconstruction and tissue engineering. expression of the antimicrobial peptides such as defensins, elafin and slpi which are essential elements of the innate immune system results in antibacterial properties of the am. preservation is necessary to reach a ready-to-use source of the am. however, these methods might change the properties of the am. the aim of this study was to evaluate antibacterial properties of the am after preservation. antibacterial property of the fresh am was compared with cryopreserved and freeze-dried am by modified disk diffusion method. staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and two clinical isolated strains of e. coli were cultured in mueller hinton agar and a piece of the am was placed on agar surface. after 24h incubation, the inhibition zone was measured. in addition, one of the most important antibacterial peptides, elafin, was measured by elisa assay before and after preservations procedures. antibacterial properties of the am were maintained after cryopreservation and freeze-drying. however, the inhibition zone was depending on the bacterial strains. the cryopreservation and freeze-drying procedures significantly decreased elafin which shows that antibacterial property is not limited to the effects of amniotic cells and the other components such as extracellular matrix may contribute in antibacterial effects. the promising results of this study show that the preserved am is a proper substitute of the fresh am to be employed in clinical situations.
new antibiotics for bad bugs: where are we?
bacterial resistance to antibiotics is growing up day by day in both community and hospital setting, with a significant impact on the mortality and morbidity rates and the financial burden that is associated. in the last two decades multi drug resistant microorganisms (both hospital- and community-acquired) challenged the scientific groups into developing new antimicrobial compounds that can provide safety in use according to the new regulation, good efficacy patterns, and low resistance profile. in this review we made an evaluation of present data regarding the new classes and the new molecules from already existing classes of antibiotics and the ongoing trends in antimicrobial development. infectious diseases society of america (idsa) supported a program, called "the '10 x 20' initiative", to develop ten new systemic antibacterial drugs within 2020. the microorganisms mainly involved in the resistance process, so called the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae) were the main targets. in the era of antimicrobial resistance the new antimicrobial agents like fifth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, beta-lactamases inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, oxazolidones, glycopeptides, and tetracyclines active against gram-positive pathogens, like vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) and mrsa, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin resistant enterococcus (vre) but also against highly resistant gram-negative organisms are more than welcome. of these compounds some are already approved by official agencies, some are still in study, but the need of new antibiotics still does not cover the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. therefore the management of antimicrobial resistance should also include fostering coordinated actions by all stakeholders, creating policy guidance, support for surveillance and technical assistance.
in vitro trials of some antimicrobial combinations against staphylococcus aureus  and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa are rapidly increasing as multidrug resistant strains worldwide. in nosocomial settings because of heavy exposure of different antimicrobials, resistance in these pathogens turned into a grave issue in both developed and developing countries. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro antibiotic synergism of combinations of beta-lactam-beta-lactam and beta-lactam-aminoglycoside against clinical isolates of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. synergy was determined by checkerboard double dilution method. the combination of amoxicillin and cefadroxil was found to be synergistic against 47 s. aureus isolates, in the fici range of 0.14-0.50 (81.03%) followed by the combination of streptomycin and cefadroxil synergistic against 44 s. aureus isolates in the fici range of 0.03-0.50 (75.86%). the combination of streptomycin and cefadroxil was observed to be synergistic against 39 p. aeruginosa isolates in the fici range of 0.16-0.50 (81.28%). further actions are needed to characterize the possible interaction mechanism between these antibiotics. moreover, the combination of streptomycin and cefadroxil may lead to the development of a new and vital antimicrobial against simultaneous infections of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa.

cell-free supernatants obtained from fermentation of cheese whey hydrolyzates and phenylpyruvic acid by lactobacillus plantarum as a source of antimicrobial compounds, bacteriocins, and natural aromas.
cheese whey hydrolyzates supplemented with phenylpyruvic acid (ppa) and commercial nutrients can be efficiently metabolized by lactobacillus plantarum cect-221 to biosynthesize some compounds with attractive applications in the food market. the main metabolites of cell-free extracts were antimicrobial compounds such as phenyllactic acid (pla) and lactic acid (la). the production of pla by l. plantarum cect-221 was evaluated in the man-rogosa-sharpe broth supplemented with two biosynthetic precursors: phenylalanine or ppa. using 30.5 mm ppa, the microorganism increased sevenfold the concentration of pla producing 16.4 mm pla in 46 h. a concentration of 40 mm ppa was a threshold to avoid substrate inhibition. the biosynthesis of whey hydrolyzates as a carbon source was enhanced by fed-batch fermentation of ppa; the average productivity of pla increased up to 45.4 +/- 3.02 mm after 120 h with a product yield of 0.244 mm mm(-1); meanwhile, la reached 26.1 +/- 1.3 g l(-1) with a product yield of 0.72 g g(-1). cell-free fed-batch extracts charged in wells showed bacteriocin activity with halos of 7.49 +/- 1.44 mm in plates inoculated with carnobacterium piscicola and antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus (11.54 +/- 1.14 mm), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.17 +/- 2.46 mm), listeria monocytogenes (7.75 +/- 1.31 mm), and salmonella enterica (3.60 +/- 1.52 mm). additionally, the analysis of the volatile composition of the headspace of this cell-free extract revealed that l. plantarum is a potential producer for natural aromas, such as acetophenone, with high price in the market. this is the first report of pla production from cheese whey and ppa. the extracts showed bacteriocin activity and potential to be applied as an antimicrobial in the elaboration of safer foods.
in vitro antimicrobial properties of silver-polysaccharide coatings on porous fiber-reinforced composites for bone implants.
biostable fiber-reinforced composite (frc) implants prepared from bisphenol-a-dimethacrylate and triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate resin reinforced with e-glass fibers have been successfully used in cranial reconstructions in 15 patients. recently, porous frc structures were suggested as potential implant materials. compared with smooth surface, porous surface allows implant incorporation via bone ingrowth, but is also a subject to bacterial attachment. non-cytotoxic silver-polysaccharide nanocomposite coatings may provide a way to decrease the risk of bacterial contamination of porous frc structures. this study is focused on the in vitro characterization of the effect porosity on the antimicrobial efficiency of the coatings against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa by a series of microbiological tests (initial adhesion, antimicrobial efficacy, and biofilm formation). characterization included confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. the effect of porosity on the initial attachment of s. aureus was pronounced, but in the case of p. aeruginosa the effect was negligible. there were no significant effects of the coatings on the initial bacterial attachment. in the antimicrobial efficacy test, the coatings were potent against both strains regardless of the sample morphology. in the biofilm tests, there were no clear effects either of morphology or of the coating. further coating development is foreseen to achieve a longer-term antimicrobial effect to inhibiting bacterial implant colonization.

antimicrobial activity and phytochemical constituents of leaf extracts of cassia  auriculata.
plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'for centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. in the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). the aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). the extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. the antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from cassia auriculata.
[adherence to copper and stainless steel metal coupons of common nosocomial bacterial strains].
background: copper has a bactericidal activity against a series of bacterial strains. aim: to measure resistance to bacterial adherence of copper (cu) and stainless steel (ss) metal coupons. material and methods: bacterial strains causing nosocomial infections in chile were analyzed. bacterial adherence was studied using a previously described method based on a system of metal coupons that are immersed in culture media containing the bacteria of interest at room temperature. results: adherence to cu and ss coupons was different for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii strains. for these strains, no adherence to cu coupons occurred during the 48 h observation period compared to a rapidly increasing adherence to ss coupons, with a final colony count of 1.00 e + 07 cfu/ml. for two different pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains, inhibition of adherence was not observed on cu coupons, and colony counts were similar for cu and ss using the standard inoculum (2-3 x lo7 cfu).a partial decrease in adherence was observed for cu but not for ss coupons, when a lower inoculum was used. conclusions: copper surfaces represent an interesting option to reduce bacterial contamination in the hospital environment due to its resistance to bacterial adhesion of most of the common nosocomial bacterial strains.
design, synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of novel 1,3-oxazolidin-2- one derivatives.
a series of novel derivatives of 1,3-oxazolidin-2-one 12a-12n has been synthesized starting from 4-nitro-(l)- phenylalanine by involving five-step reaction sequence. all the compounds were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacterial strains namely, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis (gram-positive), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative) and in vitro antifungal activity against two pathogenic fungal strains namely, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae. all the synthesized compounds showed activity against gram-positive bacteria. compounds 12c and 12l exhibited maximum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. however, against gram-negative bacteria only five of screened compounds were found to be active. compounds 12c and 12i displayed best antifungal activity against the tested fungi. docking studies were carried out in order to gain insight into the mechanism of action and the binding mode of these compounds. these studies were in agreement with the biological data.
3-aryl-4-acyloxyethoxyfuran-2(5h)-ones as inhibitors of tyrosyl-trna synthetase:  synthesis, molecular docking and antibacterial evaluation.
thirty-eight 3-aryl-4-acyloxyethoxyfuran-2(5h)-ones were designed, prepared and tested for antibacterial activities. some of them showed significant antibacterial activity against gram-positive organism, gram-negative organism and fungus. out of these compounds, 4-(2-(3-chlorophenylformyloxy)ethoxy)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)furan-2(5h)-one (d40) showed the widest spectrum of activity with mic50 of 2.0mug/ml against staphylococcus aureus, 4.3mug/ml against escherichia coli, 1.5mug/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1.2mug/ml against candida albicans. our data disclosed that mic50 values against whole cell bacteria are positive correlation with mic50 values against tyrosyl-trna synthetase. meanwhile, molecular docking of d40 into s. aureus tyrosyl-trna synthetase active site was also performed, and the inhibitor tightly fitting the active site might be an important reason why it has high antimicrobial activity.

time-kill curve experiments were performed with linezolid, doripenem, tigecycline, moxifloxacin, and daptomycin against staphylococcus aureus and with colistin, moxifloxacin, and doripenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa to evaluate the effect of porcine pulmonary surfactant on antimicrobial activity. pulmonary surfactant significantly impaired the activities of moxifloxacin and colistin. when antibiotics are being developed for respiratory tract infections, the method described here might be used to preliminarily quantify the effect of pulmonary surfactant on antimicrobial activity.
bactericidal effect of poly(acrylamide/itaconic acid)-silver nanoparticles synthesized by gamma irradiation against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles is gaining importance due its broad spectrum of targets in cell compared to conventional antimicrobial agents. in this context, silver nanoparticles were synthesized by gamma irradiation-induced reduction method of acrylamide and itaconic acid with irradiation dose up to 70 kgy. silver nanoparticles were examined by fourier-transform infrared, scanning electron microscopic images (sem), and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. the particle size was determined by x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (tem), and dynamic light scattering. the antibacterial effect was studied by disk diffusion method against some bacterial pathogenic strains. silver nanoparticles showed promising activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and slightly active against escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and klebsiella pneumonia. the bactericidal effect of silver nanoparticles was tested against p. aeruginosa. the killing rate of p. aeruginosa was found to be 90 % of viability at (100 mul/ml) of silver nanoparticles. exposure of p. aeruginosa cells to silver nanoparticles caused fast loss of 260 nm absorbing materials and release of potassium ions. the tem and sem observation showed that silver nanoparticles may destroy the structure of bacterial cell membrane in order to enter the bacterial cell resulting in the leakage of the cytoplasmic component and the eventual death.
convenient syntheses of cyanuric chloride-derived nhc ligands, their ag(i) and au(i) complexes and antimicrobial activity.
convenient syntheses of mono- and bis-imidazolium 1,3,5-triazine derivatives bearing piperidine and morpholine substituents are reported. in situ deprotonation of the mono-imidazolium salts and reaction with ag2o or au(tht)cl (tht = tetrahydrothiophene) precursors affords the corresponding ag(nhc)cl and au(nhc)cl carbene complexes. in the presence of ag(i) or au(i) salts the bis-imidazolium pincers eliminate the imidazolium group to afford -ome or -nme2 substituted triazines depending on the solvent used. in solution, the ag(i) and au(i) complexes show a barrier to rotation about the ctriazine-namine bonds, with calculated deltag( not equal) barriers in the region of 70 kj mol(-1). single crystal x-ray structures of several of the proligands and their corresponding ag(i) and au(i) complexes were obtained. these universally reveal an extended, rigidly planar pi-conjugated network between the triazine core, imidazolium/imidazolylidene substituents and exocyclic amine functions, to which the origin of the rotational barrier observed in solution is attributed. only very weak ntriazine-metal interactions are observed in the solid state, as indicated by small deviations of the cnhc-ag-cl bond angles from 180 degrees and also supported by dft calculations on the ag(nhc)cl complex (nhc = 4,6-dipiperidinyl-2-methylimidazolylidene triazine). preliminary antimicrobial susceptibility studies against five microorganisms (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus nctc 13277, s. aureus nctc 6571, pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc 10662, proteus mirabilis nctc 11938 and candida albicans atcc 90028) show that the above triazine-based ag-nhc complexes are active antimicrobial and antifungal agents.

ethnopharmacological relevance: monochasma savatieri franch. ex maxim is used for treating many diseases in traditional chinese medicine. aim of the study: the present study was designed to evaluate antibacterial, anti-inflammatory activities and toxicity of the total phenylethanoid glycosides from monochasma savatieri franch. ex maxim (tpg). materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of tpg was checked by mic and mbc in vitro; survival of mice with pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus infection-induced sepsis was investigated to evaluate antibacterial activity of tpg in vivo. additionally, antibacterial activities of tpg were also investigated in a pseudomonas aeruginosa infection-induced pneumonia in the mice model. cotton pellet induced granuloma and xylene induced ear swelling in mice models were used to quantify the anti-inflammatory activity. results: tpg showed a significant possess bacteriostatic properties against five bacteria strains at a concentration between 0.0625 and 16 mg/ml. moreover, tpg has bactericidal activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae or escherichia coli. tpg (60, 120, and 180 mg/kg) prolonged survival rate of mice with pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus infection-induced sepsis. in addition, tpg (180 mg/kg) could reduce the bacterial colony-forming units in lung tissue. furthermore, tpg (60-180 mg/kg) had significantly reduced xylene-induced ear edema and granulomat formation induced by cotton pellet at a dose-dependent manner. in addition, administration of tpg (1.5 g/kg) for 15 days did not result in toxicities in liver, kidney, spleen and thymus tissue in rats. conclusion: these results indicated that tpg might be useful for the development of a novel treatment for respiratory infections or pneumonia caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus.
systematic study of non-natural short cationic lipopeptides as novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.
we describe the design and synthesis of a new series of non-natural short cationic lipopeptides (mw = 700) as antimicrobial agents. all of the synthesized lipopeptides were tested against a range of microbes such as gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria, fungi including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse). by systematic study of design template, we found that three ornithine residues conjugated with myristic acid are minimum requirement for a compound to be an antimicrobial agent. the most potent lipopeptide lp16 possesses broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and has mics in the range of 1.5-6.25 mug/ml against escherichia coli, s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, and mrse. all lipopeptides showed high selectivity toward microbial strains as compared to human red blood cells (hc50 > 250 mug/ml). moreover, most potent lipopeptides (lp16 and lp23) did not induce drug resistance in s. aureus even after 15 rounds of passaging. in addition, a representative lipopeptide (lp16) showed tryptic stability for 24 h. these results suggest the potential of short cationic lipopeptides to boost the discovery of future antimicrobial therapeutics.
effective inhibition of bacterial respiration and growth by cuo microspheres composed of thin nanosheets.
this study describes the synthesis, characterization and biocidal potential of copper oxide micro-spheres composed of thin sheets (cuomss-ths). microscopic observations of synthesized cuomss-ths revealed the clusters of thin sheets arranged in small flower like micro-spheres. diameter of each micro-sphere was determined in the range of 2-3 mum, whereas the size of each sheet was approximately 80 nm. these micro-flowers like nanostructures were synthesized using copper nitrate hexahydrate and sodium hydroxide via solution process. the cuomss-ths exhibited a broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity involving significant growth inhibition of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus. the ic50 values of these engineered nps against e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and m. luteus were determined to be 195, 200, 131 and 184 mug/ml, respectively. also, the respiration of gram+ ve organisms (m. luteus and s. aureus) was inhibited significantly (p value < 0.005) at relatively lower concentrations of 12.5 and 50 mug/ml, respectively, as compared to the gram- ve bacteria (e. coli and p. aeruginosa), where the growth inhibition occurred at a much greater concentration of 100 mug/ml. the results explicitly demonstrated anti-microbial activity of cuomss-ths with a higher level of toxicity against the gram+ ve vis-a-vis gram- ve bacteria.
antimicrobial activity of willowherb (epilobium angustifolium l.) leaves and flowers.
since the aetiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (bhp) is still unknown, the use of medicinal herb extracts and products prepared thereof are recommended due to their antimicrobial activity, especially during early stages of bhp. a comparison was performed of the in vitro antimicrobial activity (using broth microdilution assay) of flowers and leaves of willowherb (epilobium angustifolium l., onagraceae) from mt. velebit (croatia). the strains (standard atcc and clinical isolates) of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli (including p-fimbriae positive strain), pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, candida albicans, c. tropicalis, c. dubliniensis and saccharomyces cerevisiae were susceptible with mic values between 4.6+/-0.2 and 18.2+/-0.8 mg/ml. the results of in vitro studies showed that no differences were found in the antimicrobial activity between the ethanol extracts of leaves and flowers of e. angustifolium. using the quantitative fluorescent assay with ethidium bromide and acridine orange, the viability of c. albicans atcc 10231 was assessed after in vitro exposure to e. angustifolium leaf and flower ethanol extracts. apoptosis of c. albicans blastospores dominated over necrosis in all treated samples after short-term exposure with 6 to 12 mg/ml of extracts. in addition to the valuable biological activity of e. angustifolium extracts, the data obtained from the in vitro diffusion, the dilution assay and antifungal viability fluorescent assay suggest that leaf and flower ethanol extracts of e. angustifolium l. are a promising complementary herbal therapy of conditions such as bhp.
[antimicrobial activity of stable silver nanoparticles of a certain size].
conditions for obtaining stable silver nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm were developed using a binary stabilizer polyvinylpyrrolidone/sodium dodecylsulphate in optimal ratio. optical spectra, morphology and dependence of size of the nanoparticles on the amount of reducing agent were studied. colloidal solutions of nanosilver showed a high bactericidal activity against strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fungicidal activity against candida albicans. the mechanism of action of nanosized silver on microbial cell was examined by laser scanning confocal microscope using fluorescent label. first step of antimicrobial effect on microorganisms was membrane damage and penetration of silver nanoparticles into the cell. prolonged stability of nanoparticles and their antimicrobial activity over the past two years were showed.

a new series of pdii complexes derived from thiosemicarbazone has been synthesized. the synthesized pdii complexes have been characterized on the basis of elemental analyses, ft-ir, (1)h- and (1)(3)c-nmr, uv/vis, and thermal studies. a square-planar geometry has been assigned around pdii ions on the basis of results obtained from uv/vis studies. the thiosemicarbazone ligand and its pdii complexes have been screened against gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria in vitro as growth-inhibiting agents, and the results revealed significant antibacterial activities.
[in vitro activity of eucalyptus smithii and juniperus communis essential oils against bacterial biofilms and efficacy perspectives of complementary inhalation therapy in chronic and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections].
staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa have a high propensity to develop biofilms that are resistant to antimicrobial agents. eucalyptus smithii and juniperus communis essential oils are credited with a series of traditional therapeutical properties, including mucolytic effect. as s. aureus and p. aeruginosa biofilms are known to be important factors underlying their virulence and pathogenicity, the aim of this study was to investigate whether e. smithii and j. communis essential oils can interfere with biofilm formation as well as acting on mature biofilms. tests of two s. aureus and p. aeruginosa clinical strains and two atcc strains (s. aureus atcc 25923 and p. aeruginosa atcc 27853) showed that both e. smithii and j. communis essential oils interfere with the starting phases of biofilm production, as well as with mature biofilms. the results of this study reveal new relevant perspectives for a complementary inhalatory treatment of chronic and/or recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.
particle-cell contact enhances antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles.
background: it is generally accepted that antibacterial properties of ag nanoparticles (agnps) are dictated by their dissolved fraction. however, dissolution-based concept alone does not fully explain the toxic potency of nanoparticulate silver compared to silver ions. methodology/principal findings: herein, we demonstrated that the direct contact between bacterial cell and agnps' surface enhanced the toxicity of nanosilver. more specifically, cell-np contact increased the cellular uptake of particle-associated ag ions - the single and ultimate cause of toxicity. to prove that, we evaluated the toxicity of three different agnps (uncoated, pvp-coated and protein-coated) to six bacterial strains: gram-negative escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida and p. aeruginosa and gram-positive bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. while the toxicity of agno3 to these bacteria varied only slightly (the 4-h ec50 ranged from 0.3 to 1.2 mg ag/l), the 4-h ec50 values of protein-coated agnps for various bacterial strains differed remarkably, from 0.35 to 46 mg ag/l. by systematically comparing the intracellular and extracellular free ag(+) liberated from agnps, we demonstrated that not only extracellular dissolution in the bacterial test environment but also additional dissolution taking place at the particle-cell interface played an essential role in antibacterial action of agnps. the role of the np-cell contact in dictating the antibacterial activity of ag-nps was additionally proven by the following observations: (i) separation of bacterial cells from agnps by particle-impermeable membrane (cut-off 20 kda, approximately 4 nm) significantly reduced the toxicity of agnps and (ii) p. aeruginosa cells which tended to attach onto agnps, exhibited the highest sensitivity to all forms of nanoparticulate ag. conclusions/significance: our findings provide new insights into the mode of antibacterial action of nanosilver and explain some discrepancies in this field, showing that "ag-ion" and "particle-specific" mechanisms are not controversial but, rather, are two faces of the same coin.
surface functionalization of titanium substrates with cecropin b to improve their cytocompatibility and reduce inflammation responses.
bacteria-related inflammation is a common postoperative complication in orthopedic implantation. in this study, cecropin b (cecb), a cationic peptide, was immobilized onto the surfaces of titanium substrates to improve their cytocompatibility and reduce inflammation responses. polydopamine film was coated onto the surfaces of titanium substrates as an intermediate layer for the further immobilization of the cecb, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (sem), atomic force microscopy (afm), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and water contact angle measurement, respectively. osteoblasts grown onto the cecb-immobilized titanium substrates displayed significantly higher (p<0.01) cell viability than that of native titanium substrates (controls). gram-positive bacteria - bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria - escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa were employed for antibacterial characterization. media-borne assay and anti-biofilm formation showed that cecb-immobilized titanium substrates inhibited the adhesion and growth of bacteria. macrophages cultured onto cecb-immobilized titanium substrates demonstrated statistically lower (p<0.01) levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) than those of the control groups. the results indicated that the immobilization of cecb onto titanium substrates was responsible for improved cytocompatibility and reduced inflammation responses. the approach presented here has great potential in the development of antibacterial titanium-based implants in clinical applications.
design, synthesis and antibacterial activity studies of thiazole derivatives as potent eckas iii inhibitors.
two series of thiazole derivatives containing amide skeleton were synthesized and developed as potent escherichia coli beta-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase iii (eckas iii) inhibitors. all the 24 new synthesized compounds were assayed for antibacterial activity against the respective gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial strains, including e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. in which, 10 compounds with broad-spectrum antibacterial activities were further tested for their eckas iii inhibitory activity. last, we have successfully found that compound 4e showed both the promising broad antibacterial activity with mic of 1.56-6.25mug/ml against the representative bacterial stains, and also processed the most potent eckas iii inhibitory activity with ic50 of 5.3mum. in addition, docking simulation also carried out in this study to give a potent prediction binding mode between the small molecule and eckas iii (pdb code: 1hnj) protein.
impact of intensive infection control team activities on the acquisition of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated disease.
the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (mdros) is an emerging problem  in acute healthcare facilities. to reduce this transmission, we introduced intensive infection control team (ict) activities and investigated the impact of their introduction. this study was conducted at a single teaching hospital from 1 april 2010 to 31 march 2012. during the intervention period, all carbapenem use was monitored by the ict, and doctors using carbapenems inappropriately were individually instructed. information related to patients with newly identified mdros was provided daily to the ict and instructions on the appropriate infection control measures for mdros were given immediately with continuous monitoring. the medical records of newly hospitalized patients were reviewed daily to check previous microbiological results and infection control intervention by the ict was also performed for patients with a previous history of mdros. compared with the pre-intervention period, the antimicrobial usage density of carbapenems decreased significantly (28.5 vs. 17.8 defined daily doses/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001) and the frequency of use of sanitary items, especially the use of aprons, increased significantly (710 vs 1854 pieces/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001). the number of cases with hospital-acquired mrsa (0.66 vs. 0.29 cases/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001), hospital-acquired drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.23 vs. 0.06 cases/1000 inpatient days; p = 0.006) and nosocomial clostridium difficile-associated disease (0.47 vs. 0.11 cases/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001) decreased significantly during the intervention period. our study showed that proactive and continuous ict interventions were effective for reduction of mdro transmission.

(1) compared to the pbs and ppp, the apg and apg-apo groups showed strong antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus. there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between apg and apg-apo. (2) compared to pbs, apg, apg-apo, and prp showed obvious antibacterial effects against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. no significant difference (p > 0.05) was revealed among the three groups. compared to the ppp group, they did not show antibacterial effect against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p > 0.05). conclusions. apg has antibacterial effect against staphylococcus aureus mediated by platelet activation in the diabetic patients with dermal ulcer, and does not present obvious antibacterial effect against escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa. combination of apg and antibiotics may have synergistic antibacterial effect.
sap-containing dressings exhibit sustained antimicrobial effects over 7 days in vitro.
objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of sap-containing wound dressings in vitro over a prolonged period of time (7 days) and to assess their ability to sustain the antimicrobial effect. method: sap dressings were tested according to the jis l 1902:2002 against the pathogens staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and candida albicans.additionally, effect on s. aureus and p. aeruginosa growth was investigated after a prolonged incubation period of 7 days. furthermore, both sap dressings were repeatedly inoculated with p. aeruginosa suspension and, after 7 days, microbial growth under the dressings was evaluated. results: both sap-containing wound dressings tested exhibited a significant to strong antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans in vitro. moreover, it could be shown that they were able to sustain antibacterial efficacy over a prolonged period of time. using a direct incubation method with repeated re-inoculation of the dressing samples, it could be shown that growth of p. aeruginosa was reduced after 4 days of treatment and completely inhibited after 7 days. no significant differences were observed between the two sap-dressings tested. conclusion: these in vitro experiments impressively demonstrated the antimicrobial mechanism of sap-containing wound dressings: rapid up-take of fluid, binding of microorganisms to the sap-core, and retention of the bacteria inside the dressing. moreover, it could be shown that they are able to exhibit their antimicrobial activity over a prolonged period of time unless the amount of fluid present exceeds their fluid-handling capacity.
a new type of biphasic calcium phosphate cement as a gentamicin carrier for osteomyelitis.
osteomyelitis therapy is a long-term and inconvenient procedure for a patient. antibiotic-loaded bone cements are both a complementary and alternative treatment option to intravenous antibiotic therapy for the treatment of osteomyelitis. in the current study, the biphasic calcium phosphate cement (cpc), called alpha -tcp/hap ( alpha -tricalcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite) biphasic cement, was prepared as an antibiotics carrier for osteomyelitis. the developed biphasic cement with a microstructure of alpha -tcp surrounding the hap has a fast setting time which will fulfill the clinical demand. the x-ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared spectrometry analyses showed the final phase to be hap, the basic bone mineral, after setting for a period of time. scanning electron microscopy revealed a porous structure with particle sizes of a few micrometers. the addition of gentamicin in alpha -tcp/hap would delay the transition of alpha -tcp but would not change the final-phase hap. the gentamicin-loaded alpha -tcp/hap supplies high doses of the antibiotic during the initial 24 hours when they are soaked in phosphate buffer solution (pbs). thereafter, a slower drug release is produced, supplying minimum inhibitory concentration until the end of the experiment (30 days). studies of growth inhibition of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in culture indicated that gentamicin released after 30 days from alpha -tcp/hap biphasic cement retained antibacterial activity.

objective: the aim of this research was to study and evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a novel 2-methylsulfanyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]quinazoline and its derivatives. antibacterial activity of the target compounds was tested against a variety of species of gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, bacillus subtilis atcc6633, and gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27953 and escherichia coli atcc 25922. in addition some yeast and fungi, candida albicans nrrl y-477 and aspergillus niger, respectively, were screened. methods: antimicrobial tests were carried out by the agar well diffusion method, using 100 mul of suspension containing 1 x 10(8) cfu/ml of pathological tested bacteria, 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml of yeast, and 1 x 10(4) spore/ml of fungi spread on nutrient agar (na), sabourand dextrose agar (sda), and potato dextrose agar (pda), respectively. key findings: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the tested compounds was determined using the broth double dilution method (serially diluted technique) in proper nutrient. for comparison, ciprofloxacin and ketoconazole were used as antibacterial and antifungal reference drugs, respectively. compounds 6, 9, 13, 14, and 11 were found to have the highest broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against s. aureus atcc 29213, b. subtilis atcc6633 and gram-negative bacteria such as p. aeruginosa atcc27953 and e. coli atcc 25922 with mic values of 6.25 and 12.50 mug/ml. conclusions: it was clear that many of the synthesized compounds exhibited good antimicrobial activity. this study has revealed that compounds 6, 9, 13, 14, and 11 have been disclosed as moderate antimicrobial agents. these compounds could be useful as templates for further development through modification or derivatization to design more potent antimicrobial agents.
biochemical composition, antimicrobial activities,and anti-quorum-sensing activities of ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts from hypericum connatum lam. (guttiferae).
we studied the polyphenol composition and antioxidant activity of the ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of hypericum connatum (guttiferae), in addition to their antimicrobial and antiquorum-sensing (aqs) properties. the extracts exhibited a similar polyphenol content and a notable antioxidant activity, which was stronger in the ethanolic extract (ec50=3.2 mug/ml). ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed different polyphenol profiles, with rutin and apigen being the main components of the ethanolic extract and caffeic acid, (-)-epicatechin and p-coumaric acid being abundant in the ethyl acetate extract. the ethyl acetate extract exhibited a more effective antimicrobial activity than the ethanolic extract against the pathogens staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. for the first time, aqs activity was detected in h. connatum: the ethanolic extract inhibited the production of violacein, a quorum-sensing-regulated pigment, in a chromobacterium violaceum tester strain, without interfering with its growth.
pyocyanine biosynthetic genes in clinical and environmental isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and detection of pyocyanine's antimicrobial effects with or without colloidal silver nanoparticles.
objective: pyocyanine plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pseudomonas  aeruginosa, (p. aeruginosa) and is known to have inhibitory and bactericidal effects. this study has aimed to detect the phenazine biosynthetic operon (phz abcdefg) and two phenazine modifying genes (phzm and phzs) by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and detection of its possible protein bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the antimicrobial effects of pyocyanine alone and mixed with colloidal silver nanoparticles were studied. materials and methods: in this descriptive study, clinical and environmental species of p. aeruginosa were isolated by thioglycollate medium culture and cetrimide agar, respectively. the existence of a phenazine biosynthetic operon and two phenazine modifying genes as well as their protein products were confirmed by pcr and sds-page, respectively. pyocyanine was extracted with chloroform and its antimicrobial effects against bacteria such as; escherichia coli (e. coli), p. aeruginosaand staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) bacteria and yeast candida albicans (c. albicans) were tested using well, spot and disk diffusion methods. results: in this study, 3 out of 48 clinical strains were unable to produce pyocyanine on cetrimide and mueller hinton (mh) agar. two strains did not have phenazine modifying gene bands. another strain did not have the possible protein band of the phzm gene. pyocyanine had antimicrobial effects against the microbial strains, which increased in the presence of silver nanoparticles. conclusion: according to the results of the present study, some p. aeruginosa strains are unable to produce pyocyanine due to the absence of the phzm or phzs genes. therefore, these genes have an important role in pyocyanine production in p. aeruginosa. pyocyanine shows synergistic antimicrobial effects in the presence of silver nanoparticles against microbial strains.
[species and drug resistance of pathogens in blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward].
objective: to investigate the species and percentage changes of pathogens in blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward, and to analyze the drug resistance of main pathogens and the risk factors for positive blood culture (sepsis). methods: a retrospective analysis was performed to analyze the species and drug sensitivity of the pathogens isolated from 2358 blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward of the west china second university hospital between 2008 and 2011, as well as the related clinical data. results: a total of 110 strains of pathogens were isolated, with escherichia coli (16 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12 strains) and staphylococcus epidermidis (8 strains) being the most common ones. from 2008 to 2011, the percentage of gram-positive bacteria decreased, while the percentage of gram-negative bacteria increased. the detection rates of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were 69% and 43% respectively, but both were sensitive to vancomycin. the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae were 69% and 62% respectively, but both were sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. malignant tumor was a risk factor for positive blood culture (or=3.564, p<0.05). conclusions: a wide range of pathogens are responsible for bloodstream infection in the pediatric hematology ward and the percentages of bacteria are changing; these pathogens have a high drug resistance rate. malignant tumor is a risk factor for positive blood culture in the pediatric hematology ward.
antimicrobial activity of pleurocidin is retained in plc-2, a c-terminal 12-amino acid fragment.
an analysis of a series of five peptides composed of various portions of the pleurocidin (plc) sequence identified a l2-amino acid fragment from the c-terminus of plc, designated plc-2, as the smallest fragment that retained a antimicrobial activity comparable to that of the parent compound. mic tests in vitro with low-ionic-strength medium showed that plc-2 has potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus but not against enterococcus faecalis. the antifungal activity of the synthetic peptides against phytopathogenic fungi, such as fusarium oxysporum, colletotrichum sp., aspergillus niger and alternaria sp., also identified plc-2 as a biologically active peptide. microscopy studies of fluorescently stained fungi treated with plc-2 demonstrated that cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes were compromised in all strains of phytopathogenic fungi tested. together, these results identify plc-2 as a potential antimicrobial agent with similar properties to its parent compound, pleurocidin. in addition, it demonstrated that the khvgkaalthyl residues are critical for the antimicrobial activity described for pleurocidin.
changes in fluoroquinolone resistance over 5 years (canward 2007-11) in bacterial pathogens isolated in canadian hospitals.
objectives: the purpose of this study was to analyse canadian national surveillance data, specifically fluoroquinolone resistance, from 2007 to 2011 inclusive, to determine trends in resistance over time and to assess correlations with patient demographic factors. methods: all isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae collected by the 10 sites that participated in the annual canward surveillance studies in each of the 5 years were included in this analysis. a multifactorial logistic regression model was used to determine the variables with significant impact on fluoroquinolone resistance. results: the proportion of e. coli isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin increased significantly (p = 0.0005) between 2007 (20.0%) and 2011 (29.2%), although similar increases were not seen in k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae (tested against levofloxacin) (p > 0.05). among isolates of s. aureus, there was a significant decrease in ciprofloxacin resistance from 34.4% in 2007 to 24.6% in 2011 (p < 0.0001). resistance to ciprofloxacin was a component of most multidrug-resistant (mdr) phenotypes for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. conclusions: a significant increase in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, primarily among urine isolates, and a significant decrease in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus occurred between 2007 and 2011. notably, mdr isolates were frequently fluoroquinolone resistant for all organisms studied, except s. pneumoniae.
volatile constituents of pinus roxburghii from nepal.
background: pinus roxburghii sarg. is one of 3 species of pine found in nepal, the oil of which is traditionally used to treat cuts, wounds, boils, and blisters. objective: to obtain, analyze, and examine the anti-microbial and cytotoxic activities of the essential oils of p. roxburghii. materials and methods: three plant parts (cone, needle, and bark) of pinus roxburghii were collected in biratnagar, nepal. the essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation, and the chemical compositions were determined by gc-ms. the needle and cone essential oils were screened for anti-microbial activity against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and aspergillus niger; brine shrimp (artemia salina) lethality; and in-vitro cytotoxicity against mcf-7 cells. results: gc-ms analysis for the cone oil revealed 81 compounds with 78 components being identified (95.5% of the oil) while 98.3% of needle oil was identified to contain 68 components and 98.6% of the bark oil (38 components) was identified. the 3 essential oils were dominated by sesquiterpenes, particularly (e)-caryophyllene (26.8%-34.5%) and alpha-humulene (5.0%-7.3%) as well as monoterpene alcohols terpinen-4-ol (4.1%-30.1%) and alpha-terpineol(2.8%-5.0%). the monoterpene delta-3-carene was present only in needle and cone essential oils (2.3% and 6.8%, respectively). bio-activity assays of the cone essential oil of p. roxburghii showed remarkable cytotoxic activity (100% killing of mcf-7 cells at 100 mug/ml) along with notable brine shrimp lethality (lc50 =11.8 mug/ml). the cone essential oil did not show anti-bacterial activity, but it did exhibit anti-fungal activity against aspergillus niger (mic=39 mug/ml). conclusion: the bioactivity of p. roxburghii essential oil is consistent with its traditional medicinal use.
the papain inhibitor (spi) of streptomyces mobaraensis inhibits bacterial cysteine proteases and is an antagonist of bacterial growth.
a novel papain inhibitory protein (spi) from streptomyces mobaraensis was studied to measure its inhibitory effect on bacterial cysteine protease activity (staphylococcus aureus sspb) and culture supernatants (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacillus anthracis). further, growth of bacillus anthracis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio cholerae was completely inhibited by 10 mum spi. at this concentration of spi, no cytotoxicity was observed. we conclude that spi inhibits bacterial virulence factors and has the potential to become a novel therapeutic treatment against a range of unrelated pathogenic bacteria.
chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils from chromolaena laevigata during flowering and fruiting stages.
the chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from the leaves, stems, capitula, and cypselas of chromolaena laevigata were evaluated at two different phenological stages, flowering and fruiting. thirty-eight compounds were identified in the crude oils by gc/ms. the sesquiterpene laevigatin was the major constituent of the leaf, capitulum, and cypsela oils, while the sesquiterpene spathulenol was the main component in the stem oils. the antimicrobial activities of the oils were evaluated against candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. stem oil obtained from chromolaena laevigata during the fruiting stage generally showed the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 62.5 mug/ml against candida albicans and s. aureus, and 500 mug/ml against p. aeruginosa and e. coli. pure laevigatin exhibited mic values of 500 and 125 mug/ml against c. albicans and s. aureus, respectively, indicating that this constituent could be responsible, at least in part, for the antimicrobial activities detected in the crude oils. more studies concerning the biological activities of isolated derivatives are required to improve our knowledge of the antimicrobial potential of volatile compounds present in native plants.

objective: to investigate the antimicrobial property of mangrove plant sonneratia alba (s. alba). methods: the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using disc diffusion and microdilution methods against six microorganisms. soxhlet apparatus was used for extraction with a series of solvents, n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol in sequence of increasing polarity. results: methanol extract appeared to be the most effective extract while n-hexane extract showed no activity. the antimicrobial activities were observed against the gram positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and bacillus cereus (b. cereus), the gram negative escherichia coli (e. coli) and the yeast cryptococcus neoformans. pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans appeared to be not sensitive to the concentrations tested since no inhibition zone was observed. e. coli (17.5 mm) appeared to be the most sensitive strain followed by s. aureus (12.5 mm) and b. cereus (12.5 mm). conclusions: from this study, it can be concluded that s. alba exhibits antimicrobial activities against certain microorganisms.
design, synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel benzothiazole analogs.
in an attempt to design and synthesize a new class of antimicrobials, dialkyne substituted 2-aminobenzothiazole was reacted with various substituted aryl azides to generate a small library of 20 compounds (3a-t) by click chemistry. structures of the newly synthesized compounds were established on the basis of spectral data. these compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against gram+ bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), gram- bacteria (salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella boydii) and antifungal activity against candida tropicalis, candida albicans, candida krusei, cryptococcus neoformans) as well as molds (aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus). the compound 3e showed maximum potency against all gram+/gram- bacterial strains with mic value 3.12 mug/ml, which is two fold more active as compared to standard drug ciprofloxacin (mic 6.25 mug/ml). however, all compounds were found ineffective against s. boydii (clinical isolate). further, only one compound 3n was found to be the most active against all fungal strains with mic value in the range of 1.56 mug/ml-12.5 mug/ml while the remaining compounds showed moderate to weak antifungal activity.
cd137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.
severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. however, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, cd137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the gram-positive (g(+)) intracellular bacterium listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. herein, we report that cd137 deficiency or blocking of cd137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with g(+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with gram-negative (g(-)) bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium). consistent with these findings, stimulation of cd137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against g(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against g(-) bacteria. neutrophils were responsible for cd137-mediated opposite roles in control of g(+) and g(-) bacterial infections. stimulation of cd137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against s. aureus but decreased these activities against e. coli, while cd137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of cd137 in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, we found that combined signaling of cd137 and toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of cd137 and tlr4 did not. our data strongly suggest that cd137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with tlrs.
phytochemical screening and evaluation of monechma ciliatum (black mahlab) seed extracts as antimicrobial agents.
objective: tribes in nubia mountains regions of sudan used monechma ciliatum seeds for common cold and other chest allergic conditions as a traditional medicine. the aim of this paper is to validate this traditional practice scientifically. materials and methods: monechma ciliatum seeds were screened for major phytochemical groups using standard methods. different extracts were bioassayed in- vitro for their bioactivity to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. results: phytochemical screening results showed the presence of flavonoids, tannins, triterpens, and anthraquinones. staphylococcus aureus was found to be sensitive to both water extract with zones of inhibition 22 - 26 mm at concentrations of 50 and 100mg/ml and ethanol extract 17 mm at concentration of 100 mg/ml. the growth of klebsiella pneumoniae was inhibited by ethanol extract with zones of inhibition equal to 16, 26, and 33 mm at concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 mg/ml, respectively. pseudomonas aeruginosa was insensitive to all extracts used. similarly, all used fungi were found to be insensitive to extracts used. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the extracts against microorganisms were ranged from 12.5 to 25 mg/ml. conclusion: the findings of the current study support the traditional uses of the plant's seed in the therapy of respiratory tract infections caused by staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae.
[comparative study of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from burned patients during two periods (2005-2008, 2008-2011) and in two hospitals (hospital aziza othmana, trauma and burn center)].
background: continuous monitoring of the bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance of the main bacteria involved in nosocomial infections helps improve treatment and prevention strategies. aim: to compare the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of the main bacterial isolates within the burned patients over two periods of 3 years and in two hospitals. methods: during two three-year periods: period 1 (p1): 1/7/2005-30/6/2008 and period 2 (p2): 1/7/2008-30/6/2011) and in two hospitals: hospital aziza othmana (hao) and the traumatology and burn center (ctgb), 2153 and 3719 non-repetitive strains were isolated from burn patients from different samples. the transfer of the intensive care unit was made on 01/07/2008 from the hospital aziza othmana to ctgb. the study of antibiotic sensitivity was performed according to ca-sfm. results: during the period p1, pseudomonas aeruginosa was the main bacteria isolated (18%) followed by staphylococcus aureus (14%) and acinetobacter baumannii (12%). after the transfer of intensive care burn unit to the traumatology center, ecology bacterial varied with s. aureus (20%) in the first place followed by p. aeruginosa (15%) and proteus mirabilis (11%). the study of the evolution of antibiotic susceptibility showed an overall downward trend of resistance in the second half of 2008, immediately after the transfer of service in the new hospital structure. the rate of ceftazidim resistant klebsilella pneumoniae decreased from 80.4% to 50%, similarly the resistance of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and imipenem decreased respectively from 61% to 39.4% and from 63.3% to 37.1%. nevertheless, the reduction of resistance was followed by a rapid increasing during the year 2009 to reach overall rates of resistance previously observed in the hospital aziza othmana. concerning s. aureus, the rate of mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) showed no significant variation throughout the study period: 60% versus 56.3% at hao and ctgb. a. baumannii brings up the problem of mutiresistance: 92.7% of strains were resistant to ceftazidime and 63.9% to imipenem during p1 with an emphasis on resistance to imipenem during p2 increased to 89.3%. conclusion: resistance is a problem in the intensive care burn unit. preventive measures have to be taken.
beta-cyclodextrin hydrogels for the ocular release of antibacterial thiosemicarbazones.
two types of hydrophilic networks with conjugated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-cd) were developed with the aim of engineering useful platforms for the localized release of an antimicrobial 5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone n4-allyl thiosemicarbazone (tsc) in the eye and its potential application in ophthalmic diseases. poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) soft contact lenses (scls) displaying beta-cd, namely phema-co-beta-cd, and super-hydrophilic hydrogels (shhs) of directly cross-linked hydroxypropyl-beta-cd were synthesized and characterized regarding their structure (atr/ft-ir), drug loading capacity, swelling and in vitro release in artificial lacrimal fluid. incorporation of tsc to the networks was carried out both during polymerization (dp method) and after synthesis (pp method). the first method led to similar drug loads in all the hydrogels, with minor drug loss during the washing steps to remove unreacted monomers, while the second method evidenced the influence of structural parameters on the loading efficiency (proportion of cd units, mesh size, swelling degree). both systems provided a controlled tsc release for at least two weeks, tsc concentrations (up to 4000mug/g dry hydrogel) being within an optimal therapeutic window for the antimicrobial ocular treatment. microbiological tests against p. aeruginosa and s. aureus confirmed the ability of tsc-loaded phema-co-beta-cd network to inhibit bacterial growth.
cellulose-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid conjugates protect mammalian cells from bacterial cells.
cellulose-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) conjugates were synthesized by the esterification of cellulose with ethylenediaminetetraacetic dianhydride (edtad). the new materials provided potent antimicrobial activities against staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus, gram-positive bacteria) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa, gram-negative bacteria), and inhibited the formation of bacterial biofilms. the biocompatibility of the new cellulose-edta conjugates was evaluated with mouse skin fibroblasts for up to 14 days. sem observation and dna content analysis suggested that the new materials sustained the viability of fibroblast cells. moreover, in mouse skin fibroblast-bacteria co-culture systems, the new cellulose-edta conjugates prevented bacterial biofilm formation and protected the mammalian cells from the bacterial cells for at least one day.
interactions of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus usa300 and pseudomonas aeruginosa in polymicrobial wound infection.
understanding the pathology resulting from staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas  aeruginosa polymicrobial wound infections is of great importance due to their ubiquitous nature, increasing prevalence, growing resistance to antimicrobial agents, and ability to delay healing. methicillin-resistant s. aureus usa300 is the leading cause of community-associated bacterial infections resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. we utilized a well-established porcine partial thickness wound healing model to study the synergistic effects of usa300 and p. aeruginosa on wound healing. wound re-epithelialization was significantly delayed by mixed-species biofilms through suppression of keratinocyte growth factor 1. pseudomonas showed an inhibitory effect on usa300 growth in vitro while both species co-existed in cutaneous wounds in vivo. polymicrobial wound infection in the presence of p. aeruginosa resulted in induced expression of usa300 virulence factors panton-valentine leukocidin and alpha-hemolysin. these results provide evidence for the interaction of bacterial species within mixed-species biofilms in vivo and for the first time, the contribution of virulence factors to the severity of polymicrobial wound infections.
microwave assisted nano (zno-tio2) catalyzed synthesis of some new 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-((5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)methyl)thieno[2,3-c]pyr idine as antimicrobial agents.
combined nano zinc oxide and titanium dioxide [nano (zno-tio(2))] has been reported first time for the synthesis of novel series of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-((5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)methyl)thieno[2,3-c]pyr idine. all the synthesized compounds (7a-7m) are novel and were screened for their antimicrobial activity against four different strains like escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis and antifungal activity was determined against two strains candida albicans and aspergillus niger. sar for the newly synthesised derivatives has been developed by comparing their mic values with ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and miconazole for antibacterial and antifungal activities, respectively. among the synthesized compounds, 2,6 dichlorophenyl analogue (7f), 4 fluorophenyl analogue (7k) and 2,6 dichlorophenyl analogue (7l) shows promising antibacterial as well as antifungal activity whereas thiophene substituted compound (7j) shows promising antibacterial activity.
cattle tick-associated bacteria exert anti-biofilm and anti-tritrichomonas foetus activities.
research on microbiota in cattle tick and the evaluation of its activity against  other microorganisms can contribute to identify new molecules potentially useful to control infections caused by bacteria and protozoa. biofilms pose increasing problems worldwide, mainly due to their resistance to antimicrobial therapies and host immune response. in this study we investigate the ability rhipicephalus (boophilus) microplus-associated bacteria may exhibit to produce anti-biofilm and trichomonicidal compounds. gut, ovary, salivary glands, and gene organ were collected from engorged r. microplus female. homogenates of each tissue were inoculated onto 15 distinct culture media. anti-biofilm and trichomonicidal activities were analyzed by culturing each bacterium isolated in a liquid medium. results showed that r. microplus cattle tick microflora varies for different tissues. bacteria belonging to different genera (aeromonas, bacillus, brevibacillus, castelaniella, comamonas, kocuria, and microbacterium) were identified. interestingly, all bacterial species found displayed pronounced activity against staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, and also against the cattle pathogen tritrichomonas foetus, confirming the hypothesis that cattle tick could be a source of bacteria active against pathogens. this is the first study showing that bacteria isolated from a tick exert anti-biofilm and trichomonicidal activities.
copper(ii) triflate promoted multicomponent catalytic clubbing of piperazinyl-thiazoloquinolines and thiazolocoumarins as antimicrobials.
step economical, multicomponent construction of two series based on quinoline and coumarin ring systems was carried out. annulation towards the 2-piperazinylthiazole system was established in satisfactory yields, using copper(ii) triflate. these multicomponent reaction products were examined for their potential inhibitory effect against two gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus), three gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and two fungal species (aspergillus niger and candida albicans). in vitro pharmacological screening data demonstrated that the majority of the compounds were found to possess a significant broad-spectrum antimicrobial (25-50 microg/ml of mic) potential and the results were comparable to control drugs. the structural assignments of final products were done on the basis of ir, 1h nmr, 13c nmr spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. the structure-activity relationship (sar) was explored to facilitate further development of this class of compounds.
the effect of new zealand kanuka, manuka and clover honeys on bacterial growth dynamics and cellular morphology varies according to the species.
treatment of chronic wounds is becoming increasingly difficult due to antibiotic  resistance. complex natural products with antimicrobial activity, such as honey, are now under the spotlight as alternative treatments to antibiotics. several studies have shown honey to have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity at concentrations present in honey dressings, and resistance to honey has not been attainable in the laboratory. however not all honeys are the same and few studies have used honey that is well defined both in geographic and chemical terms. here we have used a range of concentrations of clover honey and a suite of manuka and kanuka honeys from known geographical locations, and for which the floral source and concentration of methylglyoxal and hydrogen peroxide potential were defined, to determine their effect on growth and cellular morphology of four bacteria: bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. while the general trend in effectiveness of growth inhibition was manuka>manuka-kanuka blend>kanuka>clover, the honeys had varying and diverse effects on the growth and cellular morphology of each bacterium, and each organism had a unique response profile to these honeys. p. aeruginosa showed a markedly different pattern of growth inhibition to the other three organisms when treated with sub-inhibitory concentrations of honey, being equally sensitive to all honeys, including clover, and the least sensitive to honey overall. while hydrogen peroxide potential contributed to the antibacterial activity of the manuka and kanuka honeys, it was never essential for complete growth inhibition. cell morphology analysis also showed a varied and diverse set of responses to the honeys that included cell length changes, cell lysis, and alterations to dna appearance. these changes are likely to reflect the different regulatory circuits of the organisms that are activated by the stress of honey treatment.
biological approach to synthesize tio2 nanoparticles using aeromonas hydrophila and its antibacterial activity.
nanosized materials have been an important subject in basic and applied sciences. a novel, low-cost, green and reproducible bacteria, aeromonas hydrophila mediated biosynthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (tio2 nps) was reported. the resulting nanoparticles were characterized by ftir, xrd, afm and fesem with edx. ftir showed characteristic bands (1643 and 3430 cm(-1)) finds the role of carboxyl group oh stretching amine nh stretch in the formation of tio2 nps. the xrd spectrum confirmed that the synthesized tio2 nps were in the form of nanocrystals, as evidenced by the peaks at 2theta values of 27.47 degrees , 31.77 degrees , 36.11 degrees , 41.25 degrees , 54.39 degrees , 56.64 degrees and 69.54 degrees were identified as 110, 100, 101, 111, 211, 220 and 301 reflections, respectively. the crystallite sizes were calculated using scherrer's formula applied to the major intense peaks and found to be the size of 40.50 nm. the morphological characterization was analyzed by fesem and the analysis showed the nps smooth shaped, spherical and uneven. gc-ms analysis showed the main compounds found in a. hydrophila were uric acid (2.95%), glycyl-l-glutamic acid (6.90%), glycyl-l-proline (74.41%) and l-leucyl-d-leucine (15.74%). the potential glycyl-l-proline could have played an important role as a capping agent. a possible mechanism for the biosynthesis of tio2 nps has been proposed. the antibacterial activity of the synthesized tio2 nps was assessed by well diffusion method toward a. hydrophila, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis and showed effective inhibitory activity against s. aureus (33 mm) and s. pyogenes (31 mm).
cr(iii), mn(ii), fe(iii), co(ii), ni(ii), cu(ii) and zn(ii) new complexes of 5-aminosalicylic acid: spectroscopic, thermal characterization and biological activity studies.
the complexing behavior of mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid; 5-asa) towards the  transition metal ions namely, cr(iii), mn(ii), fe(iii), co(ii), ni(ii), cu(ii) and zn(ii) have been examined by elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, electronic, ir and (1)h nmr. thermal properties and decomposition kinetics of all complexes are investigated. the interpretation, mathematical analyses and evaluation of kinetic parameters of all thermal decomposition stages have been evaluated using coats-redfern equation. the free ligand and its metal complexes have been tested in vitro against aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans fungi and pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, bacillis subtilies and staphylococcus aureus bacteria in order to assess their antimicrobial potential. the results indicate that the metal complexes are also found to have more antimicrobial activity than the parent 5-asa drug.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts of rumex dentatus  l.
in-vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of various concentrations ranging from 150 to 500 mug/ml of alcoholic (methanol and ethanol) extracts of rumex dentatus were analyzed on different clinical bacterial strains (shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus) and fungal strains (aspergillus versicolor, aspergillus flavus, acremonium spp., penicillium dimorphosporum, candida albicans, candida kruesie, candida parapsilosis) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (mic and mbc determination) for antimicrobial activity and dpph (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assay, riboflavin photo-oxidation assay, deoxyribose assay, lipid peroxidation assay for antioxidant activity. the extracts showed maximum inhibitory effect against k. pneumonia and p. aeruginosa with no activity against s. typhimurium from among the bacterial strains while as in case of the fungal strains the maximum effect was observed against c. albicans by both the extracts. mic and mbc values determined for active fractions of the extracts against some bacterial strains (s. flexneri, k. pneumonia and e. coli) revealed that the test organisms were inhibited by all the extracts with methanol showing lower values of both mic and mbc indicating it as a better antimicrobial agent. the antioxidant activity showed that the extracts exhibited scavenging effect in concentration-dependent manner on superoxide anion radicals and hydroxyl radicals leading to the conclusion that the plant has got a broad spectrum antimicrobial and antioxidant activity and could be a potential alternative for treating various diseases.
antimicrobial isothiocyanates from the seeds of moringa oleifera lam.
4-(alpha-l-rhamnosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate (1) and 4-(4'-o-acetyl-alpha-l-rhamnosyloxy)-benzyl isothiocyanate (2) isolated from moringa oleifera seeds were screened for their antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for their antifungal activities against candida albicans, trichophyton rubrum, and epidermophyton floccosum using the disk diffusion method. isothiocyanates 1 and 2 were found active at the lowest inhibitory concentration of 1 mg/ml against all gram-positive bacteria tested (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, b. subtilis) and against the dermatophytic fungi e. floccosum and t. rubrum. statistically significant differences were found between the mean inhibition zones (iz) of 1 and 2 and the standard drugs, ofloxacin and clotrimazole. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values confirmed the good antimicrobial activity of 1 and 2 against s. aureus, good to moderate activity against s. epidermidis, moderate activity against b. subtilis, and weak activity against e. floccosum and t. rubrum. the in vitro bactericidal effect of 1 and 2 against the gram-positive bacterial strains tested is suggested by mbc:mic ratios of 2:1.
a technology for developing synbodies with antibacterial activity.
the rise in antibiotic resistance has led to an increased research focus on discovery of new antibacterial candidates. while broad-spectrum antibiotics are widely pursued, there is evidence that resistance arises in part from the wide spread use of these antibiotics. our group has developed a system to produce protein affinity agents, called synbodies, which have high affinity and specificity for their target. in this report, we describe the adaptation of this system to produce new antibacterial candidates towards a target bacterium. the system functions by screening target bacteria against an array of 10,000 random sequence peptides and, using a combination of membrane labeling and intracellular dyes, we identified peptides with target specific binding or killing functions. binding and lytic peptides were identified in this manner and in vitro tests confirmed the activity of the lead peptides. a peptide with antibacterial activity was linked to a peptide specifically binding staphylococcus aureus to create a synbody with increased antibacterial activity. subsequent tests showed that this peptide could block s. aureus induced killing of hek293 cells in a co-culture experiment. these results demonstrate the feasibility of using the synbody system to discover new antibacterial candidate agents.
antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude plant extracts from colombian biodiversity.
on a global scale, people have used plants to treat diseases and infections, and  this has raised interest on the plant biodiversity potencial in the search of antimicrobial principles. in this work, 75 crude n-hexanes, dichloromethane and methanol extracts from the aerial parts of 25 plants belonging to four botanical families (asteraceae, euphorbiaceae, rubiaceae and solanaceae), collected at the natural regional park ucumari (risaralda, colombia), were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities by the agar well diffusion method. the antibacterial activities were assayed against two gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, and three gram-negative ones named, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, the same plant extracts were tested against the yeast candida albicans and the fungi aspergillus fumigatus and fusarium solani. overall, the plant extracts examined displayed better bactericide rather than fungicide activities. in general, the best antibacterial activity was showed by the plant extracts from the rubiaceae family, followed in order by the extracts from the euphorbiaceae and solanaceae ones. it is important to emphasize the great activity displayed by the methanol extract of alchornea coelophylla (euphorbiaceae) that inhibited four out of five bacteria tested (b. subtilis, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and e. coli). furthermore, the best minimal inhibitory concentration for the extracts with antifungal activities were displayed by the dichloromethane extracts from acalypha diversifolia and euphorbia sp (euphorbiaceae). the most susceptible fungus evaluated was f. solani since 60% and 20% of the dichloromethane and methanol extracts evaluated inhibited the growth of this phytopathogenic fungus. the antimicrobial activity of the different plant extracts examined in this work could be related to the secondary metabolites contents and their interaction and susceptibility of pathogenic microorganism evaluated.
synthesis and characterization of ligational behavior of curcumin drug towards some transition metal ions: chelation effect on their thermal stability and biological activity.
complexes of cr(iii), mn(ii), fe(iii), co(ii), ni(ii), cu(ii) and zn(ii) with curcumin ligand as antitumor activity were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, conductometry, magnetic susceptibility, uv-vis, ir, raman, esr, (1)h-nmr spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis of powdered samples and thermal analysis, and screened for antimicrobial activity. the ir spectral data suggested that the ligand behaves as a monobasic bidentate ligand towards the central metal ion with an oxygen's donor atoms sequence of both -oh and c=o groups under keto-enol structure. from the microanalytical data, the stoichiometry of the complexes 1:2 (metal:ligand) was found. the ligand and their metal complexes were screened for antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungicidal activity against aspergillus flavus and candida albicans.
comparison of the bacterial etiology of early-onset and late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia in subjects enrolled in 2 large clinical studies.
background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is classified as early-onset or late-onset, in part, to identify subjects at risk for infection with resistant pathogens. we assessed differences in the bacterial etiology of early-onset versus late-onset vap. methods: subjects enrolled in 2004-2006 in 2 clinical studies of doripenem versus imipenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, with a diagnosis of vap (n = 500) were included in the analysis. subjects were classified by ventilator status: early-onset vap (< 5 d of ventilation) or late-onset vap (>/= 5 d of ventilation). baseline demographics and bacterial etiology were analyzed by vap status. results: late-onset vap subjects had higher acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache ii) scores (mean 16.6 versus 15.5, p = .008). there were no significant differences in clinical pulmonary infection score, sex, age, or presence of bacteremia between the groups. a total of 496 subjects had a baseline pathogen, and 50% of subjects in each group had >/= 2 pathogens. with the exception of staphylococcus aureus, which was common in early-onset vap, the pathogens (including potentially multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens) isolated from early-onset versus late-onset vap were not significantly different between groups. acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa with decreased susceptibility to any study drug was observed in early-onset and late-onset vap subjects. conclusions: there were no significant differences in the prevalence of potential mdr pathogens associated with early-onset or late-onset vap, even in subjects with prior antibiotics. empiric therapy for early-onset vap should also include agents likely to be effective for potential mdr pathogens. further prospective studies should evaluate microbiology trends in subjects with vap.
effects of infection control measures on acquisition of five antimicrobial drug-resistant microorganisms in a tetanus intensive care unit in vietnam.
purpose: to quantify the effects of barrier precautions and antibiotic mixing on  prevalence and acquisition of five drug-resistant microorganisms within a single tetanus intensive care unit at a tertiary referral hospital in ho chi minh city, vietnam. methods: all patients admitted within the study period were included. after a 1-year baseline period, barrier precautions were implemented and the single empirical treatment ceftazidime was changed to mixing (per consecutive patient) of three different regimens (ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam). markov chain modeling and genotyping were used to determine the effects of interventions on prevalence levels and the relative importance of cross-transmission and antibiotic-associated selection. results: a total of 190 patients were included in year 1 (2,708 patient days, 17,260 cultures) and 167 patients in year 2 (3,384 patient days, 20,580 cultures). in year 1, average daily prevalence rates for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae (excluding klebsiella pneumoniae), pseudomonas aeruginosa, gentamicin-resistant k. pneumoniae, and amikacin-resistant acinetobacter species were 34.0, 61.3, 53.4, 65.7 and 57.1 %. after intervention, ceftazidime usage decreased by 53 %; the use of piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin increased 7.2-fold and 4.5-fold, respectively. adherence to hand hygiene after patient contact was 54 %. these measures were associated with a reduction of mrsa prevalence by 69.8 % (to 10.3 %), mainly because of less cross-transmission (88 % reduction), and of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae prevalence by 10.3 % (non-significantly). in contrast, prevalence levels of the other three pathogens remained unaffected. conclusion: the combination of simple infection control measures and antibiotic mixing was highly effective in reducing the prevalence of mrsa, but not of gram-negative microorganisms.
community surveillance enhances pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence during polymicrobial infection.
most infections result from colonization by more than one microbe. within such polymicrobial infections, microbes often display synergistic interactions that result in increased disease severity. although many clinical studies have documented the occurrence of synergy in polymicrobial infections, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. a prominent pathogen in many polymicrobial infections is pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram-negative bacterium that displays enhanced virulence during coculture with gram-positive bacteria. in this study we discovered that during coinfection, p. aeruginosa uses peptidoglycan shed by gram-positive bacteria as a cue to stimulate production of multiple extracellular factors that possess lytic activity against prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. consequently, p. aeruginosa displays enhanced virulence in a drosophila model of infection when cocultured with gram-positive bacteria. inactivation of a gene (pa0601) required for peptidoglycan sensing mitigated this phenotype. using drosophila and murine models of infection, we also show that peptidoglycan sensing results in p. aeruginosa-mediated reduction in the gram-positive flora in the infection site. our data suggest that p. aeruginosa has evolved a mechanism to survey the microbial community and respond to gram-positive produced peptidoglycan through production of antimicrobials and toxins that not only modify the composition of the community but also enhance host killing. additionally, our results suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting gram-positive bacteria might be a viable approach for reducing the severity of p. aeruginosa polymicrobial infections.
design, spectral characterization and biological studies of transition metal(ii)  complexes with triazole schiff bases.
a new series of three biologically active triazole derived schiff base ligands l(1)-l(3) have been synthesized in equimolar reaction of 3-amino-1h-1,2,4-triazole with pyrrol-2-carboxaldehyde, 4-bromo-thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde, and 5-iodo-2-hydroxy benzaldehyde. the prepared schiff bases were used for further complex formation reaction with different metal elements like co(ii), ni(ii), cu(ii) and zn(ii) as chlorides by using a molar ratio of ligand:metal as 2:1. the structure and bonding nature of all the compounds were identified by their physical, spectral and analytical data. all the metal(ii) complexes possessed an octahedral geometry except the cu(ii) complexes which showed a distorted octahedral geometry. all the synthesized compounds, were studied for their in vitro antibacterial, and antifungal activities, against four gram-negative (escherichia coli, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi) and two gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus) bacterial strains and against six fungal strains (trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glabrata) by using agar-well diffusion method. it has been shown that all the synthesized compounds showed moderate to significant antibacterial activity against one or more bacterial strains. in vitro brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to investigate the cytotoxic properties of these compounds. the data also revealed that the metal complexes showed better activity than the ligands due to chelation/coordination.
[comparison of antibacterial activities of tobramycin inhalation solutions].
antibacterial spectra of tobramycin-gobby(solution for inhalation 60 mg/ml, "gobbynovag c.a.", argentina) and toby (solution for inhalation 60 mg/ml, "cardinal health inc.", usa) were estimated comparatively. the estimation involved 75 clinical isolates of microorganisms from the culture collection of the national research centre of antibiotics and standard strains of staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853.it was shown that tobramycin-gobby (solution for inhalation 60 mg/ml, "gobbynovag c.a.", argentina) and toby (solution for inhalation 60 mg/ml, "cardinal health inc.", usa) were identical by their antibacterial spectra.
rhamnolipid (rl) from pseudomonas aeruginosa obp1: a novel chemotaxis and antibacterial agent.
in the present study, the interaction of rhamnolipid produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa obp1 with the cell surfaces of staphylococcus aureus (mtcc 3160) and klebsiella pneumoniae (mtcc 618) were studied. rhamnolipid concentration below critical micelle concentration (cmc) did not exhibit significant antibacterial activity. however, on increasing rhamnolipid concentration beyond cmc a prominent antibacterial activity was observed. the results demonstrated different degree of rhamnolipid interaction with both the bacteria. this might be due to the changes in their cell wall composition. the antibacterial activity determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). the antibacterial activity is prominent within 30 min of incubation. the antibacterial property of rhamnolipid was effective in all tested ph levels (5-9). the rhamnolipid was effective in almost all tested ph levels and showed better chemoattractant property against both the tested bacteria in comparison to glucose. the increase in the membrane permeability was evidenced by increase in the release of protein, enhancement in cell surface hydrophobicity and raises in the retention of crystal violet dye. further, leakage of 260 nm absorbing intracellular materials, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) and scanning electron microscopy (sem) analysis confirmed the disruptive action of rhamnolipid. the above evidences support the idea that rhamnolipid significantly alters the cell membrane/envelop that leads to cell damage and enhances membrane permeability. such activity of rhamnolipid could be used as an additive in the formulation of antibiotic and other antimicrobial agents for enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics.
the antimicrobial properties of some copper(ii) and platinum(ii) 1,10-phenanthroline complexes.
copper(ii) (1(cu)-21(cu)) and previously established experimental anticancer platinum(ii) metallointercalator complexes (1(pt)-16(pt)) have been prepared and investigated for their antimicrobial properties. these complexes are of the general structure [m(i(l))(a(l))](2+) where i(l) represents functionalised 1,10-phenanthrolines (1(il)-10(il)), and a(l) represents 1,2-diaminoethane, 1s,2s- or 1r,2r-diaminocyclohexane. the structures of synthesised complexes were confirmed using a combination of elemental analysis, uv spectrometry, circular dichroism, (1)h and [(1)h-(195)pt]-hmqc nmr, x-ray crystallography, and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry and where appropriate. crystallisation attempts yielded single crystals of [cu(4-methyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(1r,2r-diaminocyclohexane)](clo(4))(2) (4(cu)), [cu(5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(1r,2r-diaminocyclohexane)(h(2)o)](clo(4))(2 ).1.5h(2)o (10(cu)) and [cu(5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(3)](clo(4))(2).5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthro line.2h(2)o (21(cu)). growth inhibition of liquid cultures of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) discerned the most antimicrobially potent metal complexes </=20 mum, as well as that of their intercalating ligands alone. to further investigate their mode of antimicrobial activity, membrane permeabilisation caused by selected complexes was visualised by means of a cell viability kit under fluorescence microscopy.
comparison of rosco neo-sensitabs with oxoid paper disks in eucast disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on mueller-hinton agar.
this study compared neo-sensitabs with oxoid paper disks using the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility test on mueller-hinton agar. the eucast-recommended quality control strains (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) (part i) and clinical isolates (part ii) were investigated. in part i of the study, 27 combinations of antimicrobial agents were tested on four quality control strains repeatedly up to 60 times and zone diameters of tablets and disks were compared. in part ii of the study, 351 clinical isolates were included to cover a broad range of species, as well as resistance mechanisms. in part i, four major deviations (>1 mm outside quality control ranges) were observed with neo-sensitabs. in one case with p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 (meropenem), there was a corresponding major deviation (2 mm) with the oxoid disk. the three remaining major deviations with neo-sensitabs were observed with meropenem (2 mm) in e. coli atcc 25922 and with ciprofloxacin (2 mm) and gentamicin (3 mm) in p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. for oxoid disks, there were only minor deviations (=1 mm outside quality control ranges) in these three cases. in part ii, there were six discrepancies, susceptible versus resistant, in 3,533 comparisons between the two methods with the clinical isolates. the rosco neo-sensitabs appear to be a possible alternative to oxoid paper disks for eucast disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on mueller-hinton agar.
polyox and carrageenan based composite film dressing containing anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory drugs for effective wound healing.
polyethylene oxide (polyox) and carrageenan based solvent cast films have been formulated as dressings for drug delivery to wounds. films plasticised with glycerol were loaded with streptomycin (30%, w/w) and diclofenac (10%, w/w) for enhanced healing effects in chronic wounds. blank and drug loaded films were characterised by texture analysis (for mechanical and mucoadhesive properties), scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, x-ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. in addition, swelling, in vitro drug release and antibacterial studies were conducted to further characterise the films. both blank and drug loaded films showed a smooth, homogeneous surface morphology, excellent transparency, high elasticity and acceptable tensile (mechanical) properties. the drug loaded films showed a high capacity to absorb simulated wound fluid and significant mucoadhesion force which is expected to allow effective adherence to and protection of the wound. the films showed controlled release of both streptomycin and diclofenac for 72 h. these drug loaded films produced higher zones of inhibition against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli compared to the individual drugs zones of inhibition. incorporation of streptomycin can prevent and treat chronic wound infections whereas diclofenac can target the inflammatory phase of wound healing to relieve pain and swelling.
spectroscopic, thermal, and antimicrobial studies of co(ii), ni(ii), cu(ii), and  zn(ii) complexes derived from bidentate ligands containing n and s donor atoms.
two new heterocyclic schiff bases of 4-amino-5-mercapto-3-h/propyl-1,2,4-triazole and 5-nitrofurfuraldehyde [hl(1-2)] and their cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc complexes have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, spectral (uv-vis, ir, (1)h nmr, fluorescence, and esr) studies, thermal techniques, and magnetic moment measurements. the heterocyclic schiff bases act as bidentate ligands and coordinate with metal ions through nitrogen and sulphur of the thiol group. the low molar conductance values in dmf indicate that the metal complexes are nonelectrolytes. the magnetic moments and electronic spectral data suggest octahedral geometry for the co(ii), ni(ii), and zn(ii) complexes and square planar for cu(ii) complexes. two gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus mtcc 96 and bacillus subtilis mtcc 121), two gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli mtcc 1652 and pseudomonas aeruginosa mtcc 741), and one yeast, candida albicans, were used for the evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the newly synthesized compounds.
actinopyga lecanora hydrolysates as natural antibacterial agents.
actinopyga lecanora, a type of sea cucumber commonly known as stone fish with relatively high protein content, was explored as raw material for bioactive peptides production. six proteolytic enzymes, namely alcalase, papain, pepsin, trypsin, bromelain and flavourzyme were used to hydrolyze a. lecanora at different times and their respective degrees of hydrolysis (dh) were calculated. subsequently, antibacterial activity of the a. lecanora hydrolysates, against some common pathogenic gram positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas sp.) were evaluated. papain hydrolysis showed the highest dh value (89.44%), followed by alcalase hydrolysis (83.35%). bromelain hydrolysate after one and seven hours of hydrolysis exhibited the highest antibacterial activities against pseudomonas sp., p. aeruginosa and e. coli at 51.85%, 30.07% and 30.45%, respectively compared to the other hydrolysates. protein hydrolysate generated by papain after 8 h hydrolysis showed maximum antibacterial activity against s. aureus at 20.19%. the potent hydrolysates were further fractionated using rp-hplc and antibacterial activity of the collected fractions from each hydrolysate were evaluated, wherein among them only three fractions from the bromelain hydrolysates exhibited inhibitory activities against pseudomonas sp., p. aeruginosa and e. coli at 24%, 25.5% and 27.1%, respectively and one fraction of papain hydrolysate showed antibacterial activity of 33.1% against s. aureus. the evaluation of the relationship between dh and antibacterial activities of papain and bromelain hydrolysates revealed a meaningful correlation of four and six order functions.
poly(2-oxazoline)-derived contact biocides: contributions to the understanding of antimicrobial activity.
a set of poly(2-oxazoline)-derived (co-)polymers was prepared by microwave-assisted polymerizations and acid-mediated hydrolysis and tested for antimicrobial activity in 50 x 50 x 2 mm pp compound plates containing 5 wt% of the polymers. antimicrobial activity against gram-negative e. coli and p. aeruginosa as well as c. albicans depended only on the degree of hydrolysis, while antimicrobial activity against gram-positive s. aureus was only observed for hydrolyzed poly(2-nonyl-2-oxazoline)s. the surface energies of the compound plates compared to pure pp were hardly altered, and the compounds can be considered as alternatives for pp. the presence of the biocide additives at the surface of the pp compound plates could be shown by combined atr-ir, zeta potential, and sem-edx measurements. antimicrobial activity was maintained during double incubation as well as for lowered amounts of the biocide additive of 1% in pp compound plates.
sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics increase mutation frequency in the cystic fibrosis pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa.
approximately 80% of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) become chronically  infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa and consequently require antibiotic therapy at intervals throughout their lives. achieving lethal concentrations of antibiotics in the lung remains a challenge. recent evidence from escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus suggests that the generation of hydroxyl radicals by sublethal concentrations of antibiotics may induce mutagenesis and confer bacteria with resistance to a wide range of antimicrobials. as ps. aeruginosa can persist for many years following colonization of the airways and during this time it is repeatedly exposed to bactericidal antibiotics, we tested whether its exposure to sublethal levels increases mutation frequency. we demonstrate that sublethal levels of three classes of bactericidal antibiotics commonly used against ps. aeruginosa infections, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and quinolones lead to an increase in mutation frequency, varying between c. threefold increase with aminoglycosides and a c. 14-fold increase in mutation frequency with beta-lactam antibiotics. these findings could be clinically significant because exposure to sublethal concentrations of antibiotics during chronic infection leading to increased mutation frequency may facilitate adaptive radiation of pathogenic bacteria in the heterogeneous environment of the cf lung.
optimized anti-pathogenic agents based on core/shell nanostructures and 2-((4-ethylphenoxy)ethyl)-n-(substituted-phenylcarbamothioyl)-benzamides.
the purpose of this study was to design a new nanosystem for catheter surface functionalization with an improved resistance to staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 colonization and subsequent biofilm development. new 2-((4 ethylphenoxy)methyl)-n-(substituted-phenylcarbamothioyl)-benzamides were synthesized and used for coating a core/shell nanostructure. their chemical structures were elucidated by nmr, ir and elemental analysis, being in agreement with the proposed ones. fe(3)o(4)/c(12 )of up to 5 nm size had been synthesized with lauric acid as a coating agent and characterized by xrd, ft-ir, tga, tem and biological assays. the catheter pieces were coated with the fabricated nanofluid in magnetic field. the microbial adherence ability was investigated in 6 multiwell plates by using culture based methods and scanning electron microscopy (sem). the nanoparticles coated with the obtained compounds 1a-c inhibited the adherence and biofilm development ability of the s. aureus and p. aeruginosa tested strains on the catheter functionalized surface, as shown by the reduction of viable cell counts and sem examination of the biofilm architecture. using the novel core/shell/adsorption-shell to inhibit the microbial adherence could be of a great interest for the biomedical field, opening new directions for the design of film-coated surfaces with improved anti-biofilm properties.
a reflection on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents at a major tertiary  care center in lebanon over a decade.
background: antimicrobial resistance has been inflecting deleterious health and economic consequences locally and globally. this study addresses the patterns and trends of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents over a decade, at a major tertiary care center in beirut. methods: data on bacterial susceptibility patterns at the cap accredited clinical microbiology laboratory is analyzed from january 2000 to november 2011, along with related different studies conducted during this period. results: increasing rates of esbl-producing isolates were noted for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. resistance to carbapenems remains problematic in acinetobacter spp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and started emerging in e. coli and k. pneumoniae. tigecycline and colistin maintained excellent activity against most esbl and carbapenem resistant bacteria relevant to the treatment by these agents. resistance to quinolones is being encountered in streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), though remaining relatively high, showed decreasing trends of resistance, while vancomycin maintain uniform activity. rare and sporadic vancomycin resistant strains in enterococci are encountered. macrolide and clindamycin increasing rates of resistance is noted in s. pneumoniae, group a streptococci, s. aureus, viridans streptococci and some others. conclusion: physicians should be aware of the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance to properly guide the initial therapy. these resistance problems can be attributed to uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents, thus, highlighting the need for antimicrobial stewardship to curb this threat.
[in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e. coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.
antimicrobial activity of blended essential oil preparation.
antimicrobial activities of two blended essential oil preparations comprising lavender oil, petigrain oil, clary sage oil, ylang ylang oil and jasmine oil were evaluated against various pathogenic microorganisms. both preparations showed antimicrobial activity in the agar disc diffusion assay against the gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus atcc6538 and s. epidermidis isolated strain, the fungus, candida albicans atcc10231, and the gram-negative bacterium, escherichia coli atcc25922, but showed no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc9027. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of these preparations was evaluated. by the broth microdilution assay, preparation 1, comprising lavender oil, clary sage oil, and ylang ylang oil (volume ratio 3:4:3), exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity than preparation 2, which was composed of petigrain oil, clary sage oil, and jasmine oil (volume ratio 3:4:3). moreover, the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentrations (sigma fic) of preparation 1 expressed a synergistic antimicrobial effect against the tested microorganisms (sigma fic<l). the blended essential oil preparations, characterized for their components by gc/ms, contained linalyl acetate, and linalool as major components. our experiments showed that the differential antimicrobial effect of either blended oil preparations or single/pure essential oils may be influenced by the amount of linalool and linalyl acetate, and the number of active components in either the blended preparations or single/pure essential oils. in addition, blended oil preparations expressed synergistic antimicrobial effect by the accumulation of active components such as linalool and linalyl acetate and combining active constituents of more than one oil.
novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
sm-295291 and sm-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such as methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with mic(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. unlike tebipenem (mic(50), 8 mug/ml), sm-295291 and sm-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(50), >/= 128 mug/ml). the bactericidal activities of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. the therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. sm-295291 and sm-369926 showed intravenous pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase i. sm-368589 and sm-375769, which are medoxomil esters of sm-295291 and sm-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral, oral, and switch therapies.
the effect of copper(ii), iron(ii) sulphate, and vitamin c combinations on the weak antimicrobial activity of (+)-catechin against staphylococcus aureus and other microbes.
few attempts have been made to improve the activity of plant compounds with low antimicrobial efficacy. (+)-catechin, a weak antimicrobial tea flavanol, was combined with putative adjuncts and tested against different species of bacteria. copper(ii) sulphate enhanced (+)-catechin activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa but not staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis or escherichia coli. attempts to raise the activity of (+)-catechin against two unresponsive species, s. aureus and e. coli, with iron(ii) sulphate, iron(iii) chloride, and vitamin c, showed that iron(ii) enhanced (+)-catechin against s. aureus, but not e. coli; neither iron(iii) nor combined iron(ii) and copper(ii), enhanced (+)-catechin activity against either species. vitamin c enhanced copper(ii) containing combinations against both species in the absence of iron(ii). catalase or edta added to active samples removed viability effects suggesting that active mixtures had produced h(2)o(2)via the action of added metal(ii) ions. h(2)o(2) generation by (+)-catechin plus copper(ii) mixtures and copper(ii) alone could account for the principal effect of bacterial growth inhibition following 30 minute exposures as well as the antimicrobial effect of (+)-catechin-iron(ii) against s. aureus. these novel findings about a weak antimicrobial flavanol contrast with previous knowledge of more active flavanols with transition metal combinations. weak antimicrobial compounds like (+)-catechin within enhancement mixtures may therefore be used as efficacious agents. (+)-catechin may provide a means of lowering copper(ii) or iron(ii) contents in certain crop protection and other products.
antibacterial activity of greek and cypriot honeys against staphylococcus aureus  and pseudomonas aeruginosa in comparison to manuka honey.
the antibacterial activity of 31 greek and cypriot honeys against staphylococcus  aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa was initially screened using an agar-well diffusion assay in comparison with manuka honey. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined in broth using a spectrophotometric-based assay. the mic of treated honeys with catalase or proteinase k was determined and compared with those of untreated honeys. all tested honeys demonstrated antibacterial activity against s. aureus on agar-well diffusion assay. mics of tested honeys were determined as 3.125-25% (v/v), compared with manuka honey at 6.25% (v/v). similarly, 21 of 31 tested honeys demonstrated antibacterial activity on agar-well diffusion assay against p. aeruginosa. their mics ranged from 6.25% to 25% (v/v) compared with 12.5% (v/v) for manuka honey. antibacterial activity of tested honeys could be largely attributed to hydrogen peroxide formation and in some cases to unidentified proteinaceous compounds. in conclusion, greek and cypriot honeys demonstrated significant but variable antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa and especially s. aureus. to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that has thoroughly examined the antibacterial activity of greek and cypriot honeys compared with manuka honey. the high antibacterial activity exerted by some tested honeys warrants further investigation.
anthraquinone profile, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bark extracts of rhamnus alaternus, r. fallax, r. intermedia and r. pumila.
the quantity of phenols, as well as antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, were investigated in bark of rhamnus alaternus l., r. fallax boiss., r. intermedia steud. et hochst., and r. pumila turra from natural stands in croatia. the most abundant anthraquinones in the investigated extracts were chrysophanol in r. alaternus (3.14 mg/g), emodin in r. pumila (0.339 mg/g), and physcion in r. fallax (2.70 mg/g) and r. intermedia (0.285 mg/g). the species exhibiting the highest antioxidant activity were r. fallax and r. pumila. a positive correlation was observed between total phenolic and flavonoid levels of the extracts and antioxidant activity in some of the assays. all species showed antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and microsporum gypseum with minimal inhibitory concentrations equal to or below 2.500 mg/ml. the results indicate that the investigated rhamnus species are a source of anthraquinones and other phenols, which act as multifunctional antioxidants with antimicrobial activity.
influence of hybrid inorganic/organic mesoporous and nanostructured materials on  the cephalosporins' efficacy on different bacterial strains.
the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different hybrid inorganic-organic micro- and nanomaterials (fe(3)o(4)/peg(600), fe(3)o(4)/c(12), zsm-5) on the antibacterial activity of different cephalosporins against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. the synergic effect of the studied materials was demonstrated by the increase in the growth inhibition zones diameter. all tested hybrid micro- and nanomaterials increased the activity of cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus. zsm-5 increased the activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone and fe(3)o(4)/c(12) that of ceftriaxone against pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus. the anti-pseudomonas, anti-klebsiella pneumoniae and anti-bacillus subtilis activity of cefoperazone was increased by fe(3)o(4)/c(12) nanoparticles, while the zsm-5 improved its anti-escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus and b. subtilis activity, whereas fe(3)o(4)/peg(600) against k. pneumoniae. the anti-k. pneumoniae activity of cefepime was increased by all tested nanoparticles, whereas its anti-b. subtilis and anti-e. coli activity was improved by fe(3)o(4)/c(12) and fe(3)o(4)/peg(600) nanoparticles. in conclusion, both magnetic fe(3)o(4) nanoparticles, charged outside as extra-shell with the antibiotic as well as zsm-5 microparticles carrying the antibiotic inside the pores, significantly and specifically improved cephalosporin efficacy. a probable explanation for the increase in the antibiotic efficiency is the better penetration through the cellular wall of the antibiotic charged nanoparticles.
antibacterial activity of the venom of heterometrus xanthopus.
heterometrus xanthopus (scorpion) is one of the most venomous and ancient arthropods. its venom contains anti-microbial peptides like hadrurin, scorpine, pandinin 1, and pandinin 2 that are able to effectively kill multidrug-resistant pathogens. the present study was conducted to evaluate the anti-bacterial activity of h. xanthopus venom. six gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains were tested against 1/100, 1/10, and 1/1 fractions of distilled water diluted and crude venom. 1/100 and 1/10 dilutions were not successful in any of the six bacterial strains studied while the 1/1 dilution was effective on bacillus subtilis atcc 6633, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 with highest zone of inhibition were obtained on b. subtilis. crude venom was effective against enterococcus faecalis atcc 14506, b. subtilis, s. typhimurium, and p. aeruginosa. the most effective results were observed on b. subtilis.
estimating the burden of healthcare-associated infections caused by selected multidrug-resistant bacteria finland, 2010.
background: knowledge of the burden of healthcare-associated infections (hai) and antibiotic resistance is important for resource allocation in infection control. although national surveillance networks do not routinely cover all hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, estimates are nevertheless possible: in the eu, 25,000 patients die from such infections annually. we assessed the burden of hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria in finland in 2010. methods: by combining data from the national infectious disease registry on the numbers of bacteremias caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., and susceptibility data from the national antimicrobial resistance network and the finnish hospital infection program, we assessed the numbers of healthcare-associated bacteremias due to selected multidrug-resistant bacteria. we estimated the number of pneumonias, surgical site and urinary tract infections by applying the ratio of these infections in the first national prevalence survey for hai in 2005. attributable hai mortality (3.2%) was also derived from the prevalence survey. results: the estimated annual number of the most common hais due to the selected multidrug-resistant bacteria was 2804 (530 hais per million), 6% of all hais in finnish acute care hospitals. the number of attributable deaths was 89 (18 per million). conclusions: resources for infection control should be allocated not only in screening and isolation of carriers of multidrug-resistant bacteria, even when they are causing a small proportion of all hais, but also in preventing all clinical infections.
chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of salvia x jamensis essential oil.
this is the first report about the composition of the essential oil of salvia x jamensis. the major compounds identified by gc-ms were beta-caryophyllene (14.8 %), beta-pinene (6.8 %), caryophyllene oxide (6.0 %), delta-cadinene (5.5 %), alpha-pinene (5.2 %) and spatulenol (5.2 %). the oil showed antimicrobial activity against three gram (+) bacteria: bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis, and three candida strains: c. albicans, c. glabrata and c. tropicalis, while it was inactive against three gram (-) bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae.
antibiotic producing microorganisms from river wiwi, lake bosomtwe and the gulf of guinea at doakor sea beach, ghana.
background: microorganisms have provided a wealth of metabolites with interesting activities such as antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer. in this study, a total of 119 aquatic microbial isolates from 30 samples (taken from water bodies in ghana) were screened by the agar-well diffusion method for ability to produce antibacterial-metabolites. results: antibacterial activity was exhibited by 27 of the isolates (14 bacteria, 9 actinomycetes and 4 fungi) against at least one of the indicator microorganisms: enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), bacillus thuringiensis (atcc 13838), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), proteus vulgaris (nctc 4635) and bacillus subtilis (nctc 10073). a sea isolate mai2 (identified as a strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa) exhibited the highest antibacterial activity (lowest zone of inhibition = 22 mm). the metabolites of mai2 extracted with chloroform were stable to heat and gave minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging between 250 and 2000 mug/ml. bioautography of the extract revealed seven active components. conclusion: this study has therefore uncovered the potential of water bodies in the west african sub-region as reservoirs of potent bioactive metabolite producing microorganisms.
changing antimicrobial resistance pattern of isolates from an icu over a 2 year period.
objective: to study the changing patterns of antimicrobial resistance in gram negative bacilli esp. e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas and staphylococcus aureus isolates from a 37 bedded icu of a private hospital. methods: all isolates obtained from a wide range of clinical samples (e.g.: urine, pus, blood, sputum, bal, tracheal secretions) from icu patients were evaluated for sensitivity patterns by kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. results: in the 2 year study period the rise in the number of gram negative isolates was proportionally high along with increase in their resistance pattern. dramatic rise in esbl's has led to multidrug resistant e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. also organisms like acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa are multiresistant making optimal therapy selection difficult. the incidence of esbl's has increased from 30-75% of the total isolates. the sensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa to meropenem has decreased from 90% to 60%.the antibiotic that remained most active against all gram negative organisms for 2 years was imepenem, piperacillin-tazobactum and amikacin. the positive result from this study was decrease in the number of s. aureus isolates from 25% in 2008 to 12% in 2009. the reason for this achievement was implementation of good and strict infection control practices. conclusion: 1) antibiotic resistance continues to rise among hospital acquired gram negative pathogens and complicates empirical selection of antibiotics in the icu. 2) klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas are still the dominant organisms in the icu. 3) imepenem, piperacillin-tazobactum and amikacin are still highly active against enterobacteriacea. 4) local data and strict infection control practices can only control the spread of virulent and resistant organisms.
antimicrobial assays of three native british plants used in anglo-saxon medicine  for wound healing formulations in 10th century england.
ethnopharmacological relevance: three important anglo-saxon medical texts from the 10th century contain herbal formulations for over 250 plant species, many of which have yet to be evaluated for their phytochemical and/or pharmacological properties. in this study, three native british plants were selected to determine antimicrobial activity relevant to treating bacterial infections and wounds. materials and methods: several preparations of agrimonia eupatoria l., arctium minus (hill) bernh. and potentilla reptans l. were screened for antimicrobial activity against selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of relevance in wounds using a 96 well plate microdilution method (200, 40 and 8mug/ml). minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were determined for the most potent extracts from 2 to 0.004mg/ml and hplc chromatograms examined by multivariate analysis. principle components analysis (pca) was used to identify chemical differences between antimicrobial activity of the crude extracts. results: the hplc-pca score plots attributed hplc peaks to the antimicrobial activity with all three plants inhibiting growth of gram-positive staphylococcus aureus by >50% in four or more extracts. the first two principal components (pc) represented 87% of the dataset variance. the p. reptans 75% ethanol root extract exhibited the greatest range of activity with mic(50) at 31.25mug/ml to a total mic that was also the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at 1mg/ml. additionally, the root of p. reptans, inhibited growth of gram-negative bacteria with the 75% ethanol extract having a mic(50) at 1mg/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa and the decoction a mic(50) at 3.9mug/ml against escherichia coli. conclusions: the results indicate a moderate antimicrobial activity against common wound pathogens for p. reptans suggesting it may well have been effective for treating wound and bacterial infections. anglo-saxon literary heritage may provide a credible basis for researching new antimicrobial formulations. our approach encompassing advanced analytical technologies and chemometric models paves the way for systematic investigation of anglo-saxon medical literature for further therapeutic indications to uncover knowledge of native british plants, some of which are currently lost to modern western herbal medicine.
nitric oxide-releasing dendrimers as antibacterial agents.
the antibacterial activity of a series of nitric oxide (no)-releasing poly(propylene imine) (ppi) dendrimers was evaluated against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus . a direct comparison of the bactericidal efficacy between no-releasing and control ppi dendrimers (i.e., non-no-releasing) revealed both enhanced biocidal action of no-releasing dendrimers and reduced toxicity against mammalian fibroblast cells. antibacterial activity for the no donor-functionalized ppi dendrimers was shown to be a function of both dendrimer size (molecular weight) and exterior functionality. in addition to minimal toxicity against fibroblasts, no-releasing ppi dendrimers modified with styrene oxide exhibited the greatest biocidal activity (>/=99.999% killing) against all bacterial strains tested. the n-diazeniumdiolate no donor-functionalized ppi dendrimers presented in this study hold promise as effective no-based therapeutics for combating bacterial infections.
synergistic combination dry powders for inhaled antimicrobial therapy: formulation, characterization and in vitro evaluation.
in combination antimicrobial therapy, the desired outcome is to broaden the antimicrobial spectrum and to achieve a possible synergistic effect. however, adverse antagonistic species may also emerge from such combinations, leading to treatment failure with serious consequences. it is therefore imperative to screen the drug candidates for compatibility and possible antagonistic interactions. the aim of this work was to develop a novel synergistic dry powder inhaler (dpi) formulation for antimicrobial combination therapy via the pulmonary route. binary (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and gatifloxacin hydrochloride, sd-cip/gat) and ternary (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, gatifloxacin hydrochloride, and lysozyme, sd-cip/gat/lys) combinations were prepared via spray-drying on a buchi(r) nano spray dryer b-90. the powder morphologies were spherical with a slightly corrugated surface and all within the respirable size range. the powders yielded fine particle fractions (of the loaded dose) of over 40% when dispersed using an aerolizer(r) at 60 l/min. time-kill studies carried out against the respiratory tract infection-causing bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumonia, and acinetobacter baumannii at 1 x the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) over 24h revealed no antagonistic behavior for both the binary and ternary combinations. while the interactions were generally found to be indifferent, a favorable synergistic effect was detected in the dual combination (sd-cip/gat) when it was tested against p. aeruginosa bacteria.
dual action antimicrobials: nitric oxide release from quaternary ammonium-functionalized silica nanoparticles.
the synthesis of quaternary ammonium (qa)-functionalized silica nanoparticles with and without nitric oxide (no) release capabilities is described. glycidyltrialkylammonium chlorides of varied alkyl chain lengths (i.e., methyl, butyl, octyl, and dodecyl) were tethered to the surface of amine-containing silica nanoparticles via a ring-opening reaction. secondary amines throughout the particle were then functionalized with n-diazeniumdiolate no donors to yield dual functional nanomaterials with surface qas and total no payloads of 0.3 mumol/mg. the bactericidal activities of singly (i.e., only no-releasing or only qa-functionalized) and dual (i.e., no-releasing and qa-functionalized) functional nanoparticles were tested against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa . particles with only no release capabilities alone were found to be more effective against p. aeruginosa , while particles with only qa-functionalities exhibited greater toxicity toward s. aureus . the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of qa-functionalized particles decreased with increasing alkyl chain length against both microbes tested. combining no release and qa-functionalities on the same particle resulted in an increase in bactericidal efficacy against s. aureus ; however, no change in activity against p. aeruginosa was observed compared to no-releasing particles alone.
metal based new triazoles: their synthesis, characterization and antibacterial/antifungal activities.
a series of new triazoles and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and evaluated for antibacterial/antifungal properties. the new schiff bases ligands (l(1))-(l(5)) were prepared by the condensation reaction of 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole with 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde, pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde, 2-acetyl pyridine and 2-methoxy benzaldehyde. the structures of the ligands have been established on the basis of their physical, spectral (ir, (1)h and (13)c nmr and mass spectrometry) and elemental analytical data. the prepared ligands were used to synthesize their oxovanadium(iv) complexes (1)-(5) which were also characterized by their physical, spectral and analytical data and proposed to have a square pyramidal geometry. the ligands and their complexes were screened for in vitro antibacterial activity against six bacterial species such as, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus subtilis and for in vitro antifungal activity against six fungal strains, trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, and candida glabrata. cytotoxic nature of the compounds was also reported using brine shrimp bioassay method against artemia salina.
adhesive capabilities of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from tears of hiv/aids patients to soft contact lenses.
fifty conjunctival swab samples collected from elisa confirmed hiv/aids seropositive patients who were referred to the hiv/aids laboratories of the university of benin teaching hospital and central hospital both based in benin city, nigeria were aseptically cultured on appropriate media by standard methods. the resulting isolates/strains, after identification by standard methods, were tested for their ability to adhere to two hydrophobic non-ionic daily wear silicone hydrogel soft contact lenses (i.e. lotrafilcon b, wc 33% and polymacon, wc 38%) as well as to two hydrophilic ionic conventional extended wear silicone hydrogel soft contact lenses (i.e. methafilcon a, wc 55% and omafilcon a, wc 60%) by the adhesiveness/slime production modified vortex/robin device method. evidence of adhesiveness/slime production was indicated by presence of a visible stained film lining the surface of the contact lens which was measured and recorded as strong or weak according to the density of the adhered bacterial film. fourteen (28.0%) staphylococcus aureus strains and 10 (20.0%) pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were obtained among other organisms. staphylococcus aureus strains adhered in decreasing order to lotrafilcon b (55.4 +/- 4.7), polymacon (46.4 +/- 8.4), methfilcon a (46.4 +/- 8.4) and omafilcon a (25.0 +/- 6.4) with no significant difference in adhesive strengths of individual strains (p > 0.05). pseudomonas aeruginosa strains also recorded decreasing adhesive strengths to lotrafilcon b (37.5 +/- 8.2), polymacon (28.6 +/- 6.3), methafilcon a (26.8 +/- 5.5) and omafilcon a (23.2 +/- 5.5) also with no significant difference in adhesive strengths of individual strains (p > 0.05). attachment strengths of staph. aureus strains to all four contact lenses were higher than those of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. both organisms adhered most to hydrophobic lotrafilcon b and least to hydrophilic omafilcon a. this invitro adhesion studies revealed that daily wear silicone hydrogel low water content, non-ionic contact lenses are more prone to bacterial adhesion than the conventional extended wear hydrogel high water content, ionic contact lenses and hence, there is more risk of microbial adhesion to the former compared to the latter. other implications are highlighted.
crustins from eyestalk cdna library of swimming crab portunus trituberculatus: molecular characterization, genomic organization and expression analysis.
crustins are cationic, cysteine-rich antimicrobial proteins, containing a single  whey acidic protein (wap) domain in the c-terminal end. different from the reported ptcrustin in the hemocytes, two novel crustin genes (ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3) were cloned completely from the eyestalk cdna library of portunus trituberculatus in this study. all ptcrustins share the consensus cysteine motif and are considered as type i crustins. four exons and three introns are identified in genomic dna sequence of ptcrustin3 while three exons and two introns in ptcrustin2. the mrna transcripts of ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 are mainly detected in eyestalk and gills, but not in hemocytes. although both ptcrutins are up-regulated after challenge of three microorganisms, ptcrustin3 seems to respond more quickly to microbial challenge than ptcrustin2. unlike most crustins, both recombinant ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 exhibit antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus and staphyloccocus aureus and gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, rptcrustin2 is moderately active against yeast pichia pastoris and rptcrustin3 show significant activity against gram-negative bacterium vibrio alginolyticus. these results indicate that ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 are two novel crustins and play different roles in immune response of p. trituberculatus against microbial challenge.
a microwave promoted solvent-free approach to steroidal quinolines and their in vitro evaluation for antimicrobial activities.

chitin membranes containing silver nanoparticles for wound dressing application.
silver nanoparticles are gaining importance as an antimicrobial agent in wound dressings. chitin is a biopolymer envisioned to promote rapid dermal regeneration and accelerate wound healing. this study was focused on the evaluation of chitin membranes containing silver nanoparticles for use as an antimicrobial wound dressing. silver nanoparticles were synthesised by gamma irradiation at doses of 50 kgy in the presence of sodium alginate as stabiliser. the uv-vis absorption spectra of nanoparticles exhibited an absorption band at 415-420 nm, which is the typical plasmon resonance band of silver nanoparticles. the peaks in the x-ray diffraction (xrd) pattern are in agreement with the standard values of the face-centred cubic silver. transmission electron microscopy (tem) images indicate silver nanoparticles with spherical morphology and small particle size in the range of 3-13 nm. in vitro antimicrobial tests were performed using pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus to determine the antimicrobial efficiency of the chitin membranes containing 30, 50, 70 and 100 ppm nanosilver. no viable counts for p. aeruginosa were detected with 70 ppm silver nanoparticles dressing after 1-hour exposure. a 2-log reduction in viable cell count was observed for s. aureus after 1 hour and a 4-log reduction after 6 hours with 100 ppm nanosilver chitin membranes. this study demonstrates the antimicrobial capability of chitin membranes containing silver nanoparticles. the chitin membranes with 100 ppm nanosilver showed promising antimicrobial activity against common wound pathogens.
plant essential oils and their constituents in coping with multidrug-resistant bacteria.
antibiotic resistance is documented to be a serious problem that affects the choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy and increases the probability of unfavorable infection outcome. one of the proposed methods to cope with multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria is the use of alternative antibacterial treatments, which include natural antimicrobial substances such as plant essential oils (eos). the aim of the present article is to review published studies on the activity of eos and their constituents against mdr bacteria and to formulate perspectives for the future. in general, published studies indicate that eos can be used as effective antiseptics against many species, including mdr bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, resistant isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and others; certain eos may potentiate the effectiveness of antibiotics against mdr bacteria; eos can be synergistic with bacteriophages; and polymeric nanoparticles can be used for delivery of eos and enhancement of their activity at the site of infection.
biodegradable polymer (plga) coatings featuring cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol mitigate biofilm formation.
biofilm-associated infections are one of the leading causes of death in the united states. although infections may be treated with antibiotics, the overuse of antibiotics has led to the spread of antibiotic resistance. many natural antimicrobial compounds derived from edible plants are safe for human use and target bacteria nonspecifically. therefore, they may impair biofilm formation with less evolutionary pressure on pathogens. here, we explore the use of two natural antimicrobial compounds, cinnamaldehyde (ca, from cinnamon) and carvacrol (carv, from oregano), for biofilm prevention. we have fabricated and characterized films that incorporate ca and carv into the biodegradable, fda-approved polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), plga. the addition of ca and carv to plga films not only adds antimicrobial activity but also changes the surface properties of the films, making them more hydrophilic and therefore more resistant to bacterial attachment. an addition of 0.1% ca to a plga film significantly impairs biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, and 0.1% carv in plga significantly decreases biofilm formation by both escherichia coli and s. aureus. pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is less susceptible to ca and carv, was not affected by the addition of 0.1% ca or carv to the plga coatings; however, p. aeruginosa biofilm was significantly reduced by 1.0% ca. these results indicate that both ca and carv could potentially be used in low concentrations as natural additives in polymer coatings for indwelling devices to delay colonization by bacteria.
dna binding mode of novel tetradentate amino acid based 2-hydroxybenzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine complexes.
few transition metal complexes of tetradentate n(2)o(2) donor schiff base ligands containing 2-hydroxybenzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine and amino acids (alanine/valine) abbreviated to khl(1)/khl(2) have been synthesized. all the metal complexes have been fully characterized with the help of elemental analyses, molecular weights, molar conductance values, magnetic moments and spectroscopic data. the schiff bases khl(1)/khl(2) are found to act as tetradentate ligands using n(2)o(2) donor set of atoms leading to a square-planar geometry for the complexes around the metal ions. the binding behaviors of the complexes to calf thymus dna have been investigated by absorption spectra, viscosity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. the dna binding constants reveal that all these complexes interact with dna through minor groove binding mode. the studies on mechanism of photocleavage reveal that singlet oxygen ((1)o(2)) and superoxide anion radical (o(2)(-)) may play an important role in the photocleavage. the schiff bases and their metal complexes have been screened for their in vitro antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae and antifungal activities against aspergillus niger, fusarium solani, culvularia lunata, rhizoctonia bataicola and candida albicans by mic method.
enantioselective synthesis of 8-epi-xanthatin and biological evaluation of xanthanolides and their derivatives.
an enantioselective synthesis of 8-epi-xanthatin (9) has been accomplished starting from the bicyclic lactone 3, which has been used for the synthesis of other xanthanolides, sundiversifolide (4) and diversifolide (5), through a synthetic route without the use of a selenium species. additionally we have evaluated antimicrobial activities of five natural xanthanolides and their derivatives. although the synthetic xanthanolides did not show any activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), some of the synthetic intermediates did exhibit moderate antimicrobial activities.
synthesis and comparative study on the antimicrobial activity of hybrid materials based on silver nanoparticles (agnps) stabilized by polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp).
hybrid materials based on polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp) with silver nanoparticles (agnps) were synthesized applying two different strategies based on thermal or chemical reduction of silver ions to silver nanoparticles using pvp as a stabilizer. the formation of spherical silver nanoparticles with diameter ranging from 9 to 16 nm was confirmed by tem analysis. uv-vis and ftir spectroscopy were also applied to confirm the successful formation of agnps. the antibacterial activity of the synthesized agnps/pvp against etalon strains of three different groups of bacteria-staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus; gram-positive bacteria), escherichia coli (e. coli; gram-negative bacteria), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa; non-ferment gram-negative bacteria), as well as against spores of bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis) was studied. agnps/pvp were tested for the presence of fungicidal activity against different yeasts and mold such as candida albicans, candida krusei, candida tropicalis, candida glabrata, and aspergillus brasiliensis. the hybrid materials showed a strong antimicrobial effect against the tested bacterial and fungal strains and therefore have potential applications in biotechnology and biomedical science.
potential novel therapeutic strategies in cystic fibrosis: antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity of natural and designed alpha-helical peptides against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
background: treatment of cystic fibrosis-associated lung infections is hampered by the presence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, many of which are also strong biofilm producers. antimicrobial peptides, essential components of innate immunity in humans and animals, exhibit relevant in vitro antimicrobial activity although they tend not to select for resistant strains. results: three alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides, bmap-27 and bmap-28 of bovine origin, and the artificial p19(9/b) peptide were tested, comparatively to tobramycin, for their in vitro antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against 15 staphylococcus aureus, 25 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 27 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains from cystic fibrosis patients. all assays were carried out in physical-chemical experimental conditions simulating a cystic fibrosis lung. all peptides showed a potent and rapid bactericidal activity against most p. aeruginosa, s. maltophilia and s. aureus strains tested, at levels generally higher than those exhibited by tobramycin and significantly reduced biofilm formation of all the bacterial species tested, although less effectively than tobramycin did. on the contrary, the viability-reducing activity of antimicrobial peptides against preformed p. aeruginosa biofilms was comparable to and, in some cases, higher than that showed by tobramycin. conclusions: the activity shown by alpha-helical peptides against planktonic and biofilm cells makes them promising "lead compounds" for future development of novel drugs for therapeutic treatment of cystic fibrosis lung disease.
the activity of ferulic and gallic acids in biofilm prevention and control of pathogenic bacteria.
the activity of two phenolic acids, gallic acid (ga) and ferulic acid (fa) at 1000 mug ml(-1), was evaluated on the prevention and control of biofilms formed by escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes. in addition, the effect of the two phenolic acids was tested on planktonic cell susceptibility, bacterial motility and adhesion. biofilm prevention and control were tested using a microtiter plate assay and the effect of the phenolic acids was assessed on biofilm mass (crystal violet staining) and on the quantification of metabolic activity (alamar blue assay). the minimum bactericidal concentration for p. aeruginosa was 500 mug ml(-1) (for both phenolic acids), whilst for e. coli it was 2500 mug ml(-1) (fa) and 5000 mug ml(-1) (ga), for l. monocytogenes it was >5000 mug ml(-1) (for both phenolic acids), and for s. aureus it was 5000 mug ml(-1) (fa) and >5000 mug ml(-1) (ga). ga caused total inhibition of swimming (l. monocytogenes) and swarming (l. monocytogenes and e. coli) motilities. fa caused total inhibition of swimming (l. monocytogenes) and swarming (l. monocytogenes and e. coli) motilities. colony spreading of s. aureus was completely inhibited by fa. the interference of ga and fa with bacterial adhesion was evaluated by the determination of the free energy of adhesion. adhesion was less favorable when the bacteria were exposed to ga (p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and l. monocytogenes) and fa (p. aeruginosa and s. aureus). both phenolics had preventive action on biofilm formation and showed a higher potential to reduce the mass of biofilms formed by the gram-negative bacteria. ga and fa promoted reductions in biofilm activity >70% for all the biofilms tested. the two phenolic acids demonstrated the potential to inhibit bacterial motility and to prevent and control biofilms of four important human pathogenic bacteria. this study also emphasizes the potential of phytochemicals as an emergent source of biofilm control products.
acceleration of protease effect on staphylococcus aureus biofilm dispersal.
bacterial biofilms are associated with the persistent infections because of their high tolerance to antimicrobial agents. hence, controlling pathogenic biofilm formation is important in bacteria-related diseases. staphylococcus aureus is a versatile human pathogen that readily forms biofilms on human tissues and diverse medical devices. as s. aureus can be naturally found in multi-species communities, the supernatants of 28 bacteria were screened to identify new biofilm inhibitory components against s. aureus. the culture supernatant (1%, v/v) of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation more than 90% without affecting its planktonic cell growth. the p. aeruginosa supernatant contained a high protease activity, which both inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and detached pre-existing biofilms. an examination of 13 protease-deficient p. aeruginosa mutants identified that lasb elastase is a major antibiofilm protease in p. aeruginosa against s. aureus. transcriptional analyses showed that p. aeruginosa supernatant induced the expression of endogenous protease genes (aur, clp, scpa, spla, and sspa) and other regulatory genes (agra, hla, and saes). additionally, exogenous proteinase k clearly enhanced the protease activity of s. aureus. hence, s. aureus accelerated the expression of its own protease genes in the presence of exogenous protease, leading to the rapid dispersal of its biofilm.
bio-efficacy of dioscorea pentaphylla from midmid-western ghats, india.
antibacterial and antifungal activity of crude extracts of medicinally important  and traditionally used yam plant, dioscorea pentaphylla, from mid-western ghats was evaluated against 27 bacterial and 5 fungal clinical strains collected of the patients from infectious sources. the clinical strains belonging to their respective species showed concentration-dependent susceptibility toward crude petroleum ether extract, chloroform extract and methanol extract at 100 mug/100 mul. the extracts exhibited predominant antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus (atcc-20852), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc-29737) and klebsiella pneumoniae (mtcc-618), respectively, and five clinically isolated pathogenic fungi, trichophyton rubrum, microsporum gypseum, tricophyton tonsurans, microsporum audouini, and candida albicans, with antibacterial drug ciprofloxacin and antifungal drug fluconozole (50 mug/100 mul) as standards. out of the three extracts, ethanol extracts possessed better minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against all the bacterial strains. all the three extracts showed significant activity against all the five fungal pathogen strains. the results are promising and support the traditional use of d. pentaphylla for the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
identification of antimicrobial compound, diketopiperazines, from a bacillus sp.  n strain associated with a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode against major plant pathogenic fungi.
aims: to purify and characterize antimicrobial compounds from bacillus sp. strain n associated with rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode (epn). methods and results: the cell-free culture filtrate of a bacterium associated with an epn, rhabditis (oscheius) sp., exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain three diketopiperazines (dkps). the structure and absolute stereochemistry of this compound were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1) h nmr, (13) c nmr, (1) h-(1) h cosy, (1) h-(13) c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclo(l-pro-l-leu), cyclo(d-pro-l-leu) and cyclo(d-pro-l-tyr), respectively. three dkps were active against all the five fungi tested (aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, fusarium oxysporum, rhizoctonia solani and penicillium expansum) and are more effective than the standard fungicide bavistin. the highest activity of 4 mug ml(-1) by cyclo(l-pro-l-leu) and cyclo(d-pro-l-tyr) was recorded against p. expansum, a plant pathogen responsible for causing postharvest decay of stored apples and oranges. cyclo(d-pro-l-leu) recorded good antibacterial activity against all the four bacteria tested (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and cyclo(l-pro-l-leu) and cyclo(d-pro-l-tyr) recorded good activity only against gram-positive bacteria. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of the dkps against the plant pathogenic fungi f. oxysporum, r. solani and p. expansum. the production of cyclo(l-pro-l-leu), cyclo(d-pro-l-leu) and cyclo-(d-pro-l-tyr) by a bacterium associated with epn is also reported here for the first time. conclusions: isolated dkps demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, especially against plant pathogenic fungi. we conclude that the bacterium associated with epn is a promising source of natural bioactive secondary metabolites which may receive great benefit in the field of agriculture. significance and impact of the study: this study is a significant contribution to the knowledge of compounds unique from epn bacteria as potential sources of new drugs in the agricultural and pharmacological industry.
chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods: the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si = 3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
activity of ceftaroline-avibactam tested against gram-negative organism populations, including strains expressing one or more beta-lactamases and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus carrying various staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec types.
ceftaroline is a new cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and -negative organisms. the prodrug of ceftaroline, ceftaroline fosamil, combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam (formerly nxl104), was tested against enterobacteriaceae strains producing ambler class a, b, c, and d enzymes, including strains producing multiple enzymes, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp., and methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains. isolates were collected from 1999 to 2008 from global surveillance programs, and susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods. ceftaroline-avibactam exhibited potent activity against enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamase types (mic(90), 0.25 to 2 mug/ml, except for metalloenzymes), including 99 strains carrying multiple enzymes (2 to 4 beta-lactamases; mic(90), 2 mug/ml). all isolates were inhibited by ceftaroline-avibactam at </=4 mug/ml. ceftaroline-avibactam (mic(90), 0.5 to 1 mug/ml) was more active than meropenem (mic(90), >8 mug/ml) and other comparators when tested against kpc-producing strains. s. aureus strains, including mrsa with four staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) types, were dominantly (99.1%) inhibited by ceftaroline-avibactam at </=2 mug/ml, and the ceftaroline mic was not adversely affected by the addition of the beta-lactamase inhibitor (mic(50/90), 1 and 2 mug/ml for ceftaroline with and without avibactam). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated limited activity against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa (mic(50)s, 32 and 16 mug/ml, respectively). these results document that ceftaroline-avibactam has potent activity against enterobacteriaceae that produce kpc, various esbl types (ctx-m types), and ampc (chromosomally derepressed or plasmid-mediated enzymes), as well as against those producing more than one of these beta-lactamase types, and its development as a therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae as well as mrsa is warranted.
study bioprospecting of medicinal plant extracts of the semiarid northeast: contribution to the control of oral microorganisms.
dental pathologies can be caused by plaque-forming bacteria and yeast, which reside in the oral cavity. the bacteria growing in dental plaque, a naturally occurring biofilm, display increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. the objective was the evaluation of a preclinical assay of medicinal plants of the semiarid region from the northeast against oral pathogenic microorganism, aiming at bioprospecting a new product. the selection of plant material for this study was based on the ethnobotanical data on the traditional use of plants from the semiarid region. the thirty extracts were subjected to the determination of antibiofilm activity against gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria and yeast. the hydroalcoholic extract which showed positive antibiofilm activity against most of the microorganisms tested in agar diffusion assay was further tested for the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and bioassay with artemia salina. plant samples tested in this study exhibited good antibiofilm activity for the treatment of oral problems. the schinopsis brasiliensis showed greater activity for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, but toxicity against artemia salina.
antimicrobial activities of aerva javanica and paeonia emodi plants.
aerva javanica and paeonia emodi plants extracts were studied for antibacterial activity against escherichia coli (nctc 10418), klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc 700603), pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus epidermidis (nctc 11047) and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (nctc 13143) and antifungal activity against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani. extracts were obtained by using methanol, n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous fraction. the extracts of paeonia emodi and aerva javanica showed significant antibacterial activity but only salmonella typhi was resistant to aerva javanica. moreover, the antifungal activity of aerva javanica was very poor but the fractions of paeonia emodi showed sufficient inhibition against fungal strains.
synthesis of certain 2-substituted-1h-benzimidazole derivatives as antimicrobial  and cytotoxic agents.
a series of 2-substituted-1h-benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities. the results showed that all tested compounds showed potent antimicrobial activity against some species of gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi) and fungi (candida albicans) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) lower than 0.016 microg/ml. in contrast, all tested compounds were inactive against staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive bacterium). the final targets were also tested for their antitumor activity in vitro on cervical carcinoma (hela) cell line. eight of the test compounds displayed more potent cytotoxic effect than doxorubicin at nanomolar concentrations. compounds 2c and 3c exerted the strongest cytoyoxic effect with ic(50) 15 and 13 nm, respectively.
enantioselective analysis of ofloxacin enantiomers by partial-filling capillary electrophoresis with bacteria as chiral selectors.
the enantiomeric separation of ofloxacin enantiomers (oflx) was achieved by using capillary electrophoresis partial-filled with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative), and staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive) as chiral selectors. experimental parameters, including the concentration of background electrolyte, applied voltage, length of the filled bacteria plug, and ph of the buffer, were intensively investigated. baseline separation of oflx could be achieved within 7 min by using e. coli and p. aeruginosa as chiral selectors under the following conditions: electrophoretic buffer composed of 10 mm phosphate buffer at ph 7.4, applied voltage at 15 kv, and the bacteria (6.0 x 10(8) cells/ml) were injected into the capillary by gravity with injection height of 17.5 cm for 180 s (e. coli), 300 s (p. aeruginosa), and 300 s (s. aureus), respectively. e. coli and p. aeruginosa had better chiral selectivity for oflx than s. aureus, which was in good agreement with oflx having better antimicrobial activity on gram-negative rather than gram-positive bacteria. a novel method was developed for the enantioselective separation of enantiomers using bacteria as chiral selectors, which provides a new approach for antimicrobials enantioselective analysis, chiral pharmacodynamics, and chiral pharmacokinetics studies.
inhibition of biofilm formation by esomeprazole in pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.
staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa are common nosocomial pathogens  responsible for biofilm-associated infections. proton pump inhibitors (ppi), such as esomeprazole, may have novel antimicrobial properties. the objective of this study was to assess whether esomeprazole prevents sessile bacterial growth and biofilm formation and whether it may have synergistic killing effects with standard antibiotics. the antibiofilm activity of esomeprazole at 0.25 mm was tested against two strains each of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. bacterial biofilms were prepared using a commercially available 96-peg-plate calgary biofilm device. sessile bacterial cfu counts and biomass were assessed during 72 hours of esomeprazole exposure. the killing activities after an additional 24 hours of vancomycin (against s. aureus) and meropenem (against p. aeruginosa) treatment with or without preexposure to esomeprazole were also assessed by cfu and biomass analyses. p. aeruginosa and s. aureus strains exposed to esomeprazole displayed decreased sessile bacterial growth and biomass (p < 0.001, each parameter). after 72 h of exposure, there was a 1-log(10) decrease in the cfu/ml of esomeprazole-exposed p. aeruginosa and s. aureus strains compared to controls (p < 0.001). after 72 h of exposure, measured absorbance was 100% greater in p. aeruginosa control strains than in esomeprazole-exposed strains (p < 0.001). increased killing and decreased biomass were observed for esomeprazole-treated bacteria compared to untreated controls exposed to conventional antibiotics (p < 0.001, each parameter). reduced biofilm growth after 24 h was visibly apparent by light micrographs for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus isolates exposed to esomeprazole compared to untreated controls. in conclusion, esomeprazole demonstrated an antibiofilm effect against biofilm-producing s. aureus and p. aeruginosa.
hybrids of ravuconazole: synthesis and biological evaluation.
in continuation of our work on antimicrobial agents, a number of hybrid molecules 4a-y containing thiazole and triazole pharmacophores were designed and synthesized. the structure of the compounds was established by ir, nmr, ms and chn analysis. all the synthesized compounds were tested for qualitative (zone of inhibition) and quantitative (mic) antimicrobial activities against four pathogenic bacteria bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and two pathogenic fungi candida albicans and aspergillus niger. of all the synthesized compounds screened, most of them show potent antimicrobial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as the fungi species.
structural characterization and surface activities of biogenic rhamnolipid surfactants from pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate mn1 and synergistic effects against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
the aim of present work was to study chemical structures and biological activities of rhamnolipid biosurfactants produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa mn1 isolated from oil-contaminated soil. the results of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) analysis revealed that total rhamnolipids (rls) contained 16 rhamnolipid homologues. di-lipid rls containing c(10)-c(10) moieties were by far the most predominant congeners among mono-rhamnose (53.29 %) and di-rhamnose (23.52 %) homologues. mono-rhamnolipids form 68.35 % of the total congeners in the rls. two major fractions were revealed in the thin layer chromatogram of produced rls which were then purified by column chromatography. the retardation factors (r (f)) of the two rhamnolipid purple spots were 0.71 for rl1 and 0.46 for rl2. lc-ms/ms analysis proved that rl1 was composed of mono-rls and rl2 consisted of di-rls. rl1 was more surface-active with the critical micelle concentration (cmc) value of 15 mg/l and the surface tension of 25 mn/m at cmc. the results of biological assay showed that rl1 is a more potent antibacterial agent than rl2. all methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains were inhibited by rls that were independent of their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. rls remarkably enhanced the activity of oxacillin against mrsa strains and lowered the minimum inhibitory concentrations of oxacillin to the range of 3.12-6.25 mug/ml.
the antimicrobial activity of the appetite peptide hormone ghrelin.
the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of the peptide ghrelin. both major forms of ghrelin, acylated ghrelin (ag) and desacylated ghrelin (dag), demonstrated the same degree of bactericidal activity against gram-negative escherichia coli (e. coli) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), while bactericidal effects against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) were minimal or absent, respectively. to elucidate the bactericidal mechanism of ag and dag against bacteria, we monitored the effect of the cationic peptides on the zeta potential of e. coli. our results show that ag and dag similarly quenched the negative surface charge of e. coli, suggesting that ghrelin-mediated bactericidal effects are influenced by charge-dependent binding and not by acyl modification. like most cationic antimicrobial peptides (camps), we also found that the antibacterial activity of ag was attenuated in physiological nacl concentration (150mm). nonetheless, these findings indicate that both ag and dag can act as camps against gram-negative bacteria.
proteomic tracking and analysis of a bacterial mixed culture.
to improve the understanding of microbial behaviors in communities, proteomic tracking, an approach for relative quantification of species-specific population dynamics of mixed cultures, was developed. therefore, a bacterial mixed culture was analyzed during batch cultivations with and without addition of the antibiotic ceftazidime. the community was composed of burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus, pathogens causing infections in cystic fibrosis patients. gel-based proteomics and mass spectrometry were used to obtain qualitative and quantitative proteomic data. during cultivation, p. aeruginosa became dominant within the mixed culture while s. aureus was inhibited in growth. analysis of samples - taken along cultivation - revealed about 270 differentially expressed proteins. some of those proteins are related to bacterial interactions, response to antibiotic treatment or metabolic shifts. for instance, the enzymes phzs(flavin-containing monooxygenase), phzd (phenazine biosynthesis protein), and phzg2 (pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase) indicated the production of the antibiotic pigment pyocyanine by p. aeruginosa that is related to oxidative stress and therefore, might inhibit growth of s. aureus. overall, the strategy applied not only allows species-specific tracking of the community composition but also provides valuable insights into the behavior of mixed cultures.
antibacterial activity of extracts from five medicinal plants and their formula against bacteria that cause chronic wound infection.
background: chronic wound is caused by various factors such as chemotherapy, gene damage, treatment with steroids, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, blood pressure, infection and nutritional factors. one of the most common causes is bacterial infection. antibacterial activity of several herbal plants has been reported. thai medicinal plants which possess biological activities are potential to develop an alternative treatment of bacterial infection. objective: to study efficiency of extracts from medicinal plants and their formula against bacteria that cause chronic wound infection. material and method: extraction of thai medicinal plants including curcuma longa linn, rhinacanthus nasutus linn, garcinia mangostana linn, caesalpinia sappan linn and centellia asiatica linn was performed by maceration with 95% ethanol and decoction followed by freeze dry. formulation was conducted by varying the ratio of each components. antibacterial activity were determined disk diffusion and broth dilution against staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. results: ethanolic extracts exhibited better antibacterial activity against tested strains than water extracts. antibacterial activity of caesalpinia sappan linn. against s. aureus and mrsa showed the most effective with mic value of 0.625 mg/ml. one of the five different formulas which contained two times proportion of c. sappan revealed that this formula was able to inhibit all tested strains with the mic ranging between 0.156 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml. conclusion: c. sappan is the most effective herbal plant. the formula with two times proportion of c. sappan is potentially best formula for development of medicinal product of chronic wound infection. the potential active compound of c. sappan is suggested for further investigation of antimicrobial activity and other biological properties.
the role of diallyl sulfides and dipropyl sulfides in the in vitro antimicrobial  activity of the essential oil of garlic, allium sativum l., and leek, allium porrum l.
the in vitro antibacterial activity of essential oils (eos) obtained from fresh bulbs of garlic, allium sativum l., and leek, allium porrum l. ( alliaceae), was studied. a. sativum (garlic) eo showed a good antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus (inhibition zone 14.8 mm), pseudomonas aeruginosa (inhibition zone 21.1 mm), and escherichia coli (inhibition zone 11.0 mm), whereas the eo of a. porrum (leek) had no antimicrobial activity. the main constituents of the garlic eo were diallyl monosulfide, diallyl disulfide (dads), diallyl trisulfide, and diallyl tetrasulfide. the eo of a. porrum was characterized by the presence of dipropyl disulfide (dpds), dipropyl trisulfide, and dipropyl tetrasulfide. the antimicrobial activities of the dads and dpds were also studied. the results obtained suggest that the presence of the allyl group is fundamental for the antimicrobial activity of these sulfide derivatives when they are present in allium or in other species (dads inhibition zone on s. aureus 15.9 mm, p. aeruginosa 21.9 mm, e. coli 11.4 mm).
biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using latex from few euphorbian plants and their antimicrobial potential.
the synthesis of well-dispersed and ultrafine metal nanoparticles has great interest due to their distinctive physicochemical properties and biomedical applications. this study is the first report of one-step solvent-free synthesis of agnps using euphorbiaceae plant latex. among evaluated eight latex-producing plants, four (jatropha curcas, jatropha gossypifolia, pedilanthus tithymaloides, and euphorbia milii) showed high potential to produce physicochemically distinct, small-sized and bactericidal agnps. phytochemical screening showed presence of rich amount of biochemicals in these plants. j. gossypifolia showed uniformly dispersed comparatively small-sized agnps. dose-dependent growth inhibition of bacterial pathogens escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, and micrococcus luteus was observed for j. gossypifolia latex-synthesized agnps with minimum inhibitory concentration values 30, 40, 70, 60, and 60 ppm, respectively, after 24 h. possible mode of action of agnps against pathogens was confirmed by analyzing enzymes and cell leakage.
mechanisms of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia-induced intestinal epithelial apoptosis.
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) pneumonia-induced sepsis is a  common cause of morbidity in the intensive care unit. although pneumonia is initiated in the lungs, extrapulmonary manifestations occur commonly. in light of the key role the intestine plays in the pathophysiology of sepsis, we sought to determine whether mrsa pneumonia induces intestinal injury. fvb/n mice were subjected to mrsa or sham pneumonia and killed 24 h later. septic animals had a marked increase in intestinal epithelial apoptosis by both hematoxylin-eosin and active caspase 3 staining. methicillin-resistant s. aureus-induced intestinal apoptosis was associated with an increase in the expression of the proapoptotic proteins bid and bax and the antiapoptotic protein bcl-xl in the mitochondrial pathway. in the receptor-mediated pathway, mrsa pneumonia induced an increase in fas ligand but decreased protein levels of fas, fadd, pfadd, tnf-r1, and tradd. to assess the functional significance of these changes, mrsa pneumonia was induced in mice with genetic manipulations in proteins in either the mitochondrial or receptor-mediated pathways. both bid-/- mice and animals with intestine-specific overexpression of bcl-2 had decreased intestinal apoptosis compared with wild-type animals. in contrast, fas ligand-/- mice had no alterations in apoptosis. to determine if these findings were organism-specific, similar experiments were performed in mice subjected to pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. pseudomonas aeruginosa induced gut apoptosis, but unlike mrsa, this was associated with increased bcl-2 and tnf-r1 and decreased fas. methicillin-resistant s. aureus pneumonia thus induces organism-specific changes in intestinal apoptosis via changes in both the mitochondrial and receptor-mediated pathways, although the former may be more functionally significant.
discovery of potent antimicrobial peptide analogs of ixosin-b.
antimicrobial peptides (amps) represent the first defense line against infection  when organisms are infected by pathogens. these peptides are generally good targets for the development of antimicrobial agents. peptide amide analogs of ixosin-b, an antimicrobial peptide with amino acid sequence of qlkvdlwgtrsgiqpeqhssgksdvrrwrsry, were designed, synthesized and examined for antimicrobial activities against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. within the peptides synthesized, we discovered an 11-mer peptide, krlrrvwrrwr-amide, which exhibited potent antimicrobial activity while very little hemolytic activity in human erythrocytes was observed even at high dose level (100 mum). with further modifications, this peptide could be developed into a potent antimicrobial agent in the future.
pilot-study on the influence of carrier gas and plasma application (open resp. delimited) modifications on physical plasma and its antimicrobial effect against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.
introduction: physical plasma is a promising new technology regarding its antimicrobial effects. this is especially accounting for treatment of bacterial infection of chronic wounds. plasma can be generated with different carrier gases causing various biological effects. screening of different carrier gases and plasma generation setups is therefore needed to find suitable compositions for highly effective antimicrobial plasma treatments and other applications. method: the plasma source used was a radio-frequency plasma jet which generates tissue tolerable plasma (ttp). the study compared the antimicrobial efficacy of air, argon, or helium plasma alone or admixed with 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% oxygen against pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus). treatment took place in an environmentally open and delimited system. therefore, bacteria were plated on agar and treated with plasma in a punctiform manner. the resulting inhibition zones were measured and the reduction factors were calculated by colony counting, respectively. results: for s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, inhibition zones and overall reduction of colony forming units (cfu) on the agar plate were observed while an accumulative reduction of cfu dominated for s. aureus. the highest antimicrobial effect was shown in form of an inhibition zone for argon plasma with 0.1% oxygen admixture for both species. s. aureus was more sensitive for helium plasma with >0.1% oxygen admixture compared to p. aeruginosa which in turn was more sensitive for argon plasma with and without oxygen. the efficacy of air plasma was very low in comparison to the other gases. the treatment in a closed system predominantly enhanced the antimicrobial effect. the effect intensity varied for each treatment time and gas mixtures. discussion: as expected, the antimicrobial effect mostly increased when increasing oxygen admixture to the carrier gases. the variation in bacterial growth and inhibition after exposure to different plasma gas compositions could be due to a varying generation of reactive oxygen species or radiation. conclusion: the applied plasma in a "closed system" accumulates bactericidal plasma species and might increase antimicrobial efficacy in clinical settings as in wound management involving multi-drug resistant bacteria.
a sunlight-induced rapid synthesis of silver nanoparticles using sodium salt of n-cholyl amino acids and its antimicrobial applications.
aqueous solution containing two additives, silver nitrate (agno(3)) and sodium salt of n-cholyl amino acid were irradiated by sunlight for the synthesis of spherical shaped agnps without the need for an additional stabilizer or capping agent. variations of n-cholyl amino acid concentration provided good control over the morphology of the agnps, while the carboxylate group of bile salt reduced the ag(+) ions and the amide group binds strongly to the surface of the nps. the optical properties, morphology of the agnps were characterized by uv-visible, transmission electron microscopy (tem) and dynamic light scattering (dls) studies. the interaction of n-cholyl amino acid on the agnps surface was studied using cyclic voltammetry and ft-ir techniques. the reduction process was completed within 5 min and the synthesized agnps were stable for more than 6 months. the possible mechanism of n-cholyl amino acid on the reduction and stabilization of agnps is also discussed. the antimicrobial activity of n-cholyl amino acid capped agnps against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeroginosa using mueller hinton broth and the antifungal activity against candida albicans, candida krusei and candida tropicalis using rpmi broth were determined by mic studies as per clsi guidelines.
comparison of the next-generation aminoglycoside plazomicin to gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin.
plazomicin (formerly achn-490) is a next-generation aminoglycoside that was synthetically derived from sisomicin by appending a hydroxy-aminobutyric acid substituent at position 1 and a hydroxyethyl substituent at position 6'. plazomicin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis and exhibits dose-dependent bactericidal activity. plazomicin demonstrates activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including isolates harboring any of the clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. however, like older parenteral aminoglycosides, plazomicin is not active against bacterial isolates expressing ribosomal methyltransferases conferring aminoglycoside resistance. plazomicin has been reported to demonstrate in vitro synergistic activity when combined with daptomycin or ceftobiprole versus methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant s. aureus and against pseudomonas aeruginosa when combined with cefepime, doripenem, imipenem or piperacillin-tazobactam. after intravenous administration of plazomicin to humans at a dose of 15 mg/ kg, the maximum concentraration was 113 mug/ml, the area under the curve(0-24) was 239 h.mug/ml, the half-life was 4.0 h and the steady-state volume of distribution was 0.24 l/kg. results from a phase ii randomized, double-blind study in patients with complicated urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis including cases with concurrent bacteremia comparing plazomicin 15 mg/kg intravenously once daily for 5 days with levofloxacin 750 mg intravenously. for 5 days are anticipated in 2012. human studies to date have not reported nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity, and lack of ototoxicity has been reported in the guinea pig model. given reported increases in bacterial resistance to current antimicrobial agents and the lack of availability of new agents with novel mechanisms, plazomicin may become a welcomed addition to the antibacterial armamentarium pending positive results from large-scale clinical trials and other required clinical studies.
profile of antibiotic consumption, sensitivity and resistance in an urban area of andhra pradesh, india.
introduction: antibiotics are an important category of drugs in which indiscriminate use can affect the susceptibility patterns among infectious organisms, resulting in antibiotic resistance. methods: data on antibiotic usage and susceptibility patterns were collected from public and private health centres in vijayawada, andhra pradesh, india, through the use of questionnaires. the data collected were then coded, tabulated, computed and evaluated using statistical analysis. results: the consumption profile of the different categories of drugs used in public and private hospitals was as follows: nutrition and metabolism products 19.0%; gastrointestinal disorder-related drugs 18.5%; antibiotics 16.8%; anti-pyretics and anti-analgesics 20.6%. these drugs were found to be in high demand. among the antibiotics, aminoglycosides (amikacin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), penicillin (ampicillin) and sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) were the most commonly prescribed drugs for antibiotic therapy. 46% of the culture laboratory reports were positive with the following organism profile: escherichia coli (36%), klebsiella pneumoniae (16%), staphylococcus aureus (29%), enterococcus faecalis (9%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). in terms of the sensitivity profile of antibacterials, amikacin (66.9%) was the only antibiotic showing sensitivity patterns, while the majority of antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin, had acquired a resistance rate of 55.1%-80.6%. conclusion: the results of this study suggest that indiscriminate prescription and consumption of new broad-spectrum antibiotics against sensitive organisms results in the development of antimicrobial resistance. therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the excessive use of antibiotics in local hospitals in order to control the trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics.
interaction of methylxanthines and gentamicin against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa: role of phosphodiesterase inhibition.
previous studies showed that methylxanthines increased the antimicrobial activity of gentamicin against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this study, the effect of non-selective phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitors (methylxanthines: aminophylline and caffeine) and partially selective pde inhibitors, dipyridamole and sildenafil, was evaluated on the antimicrobial activity of gentamicin using checkerboard method. aminophylline at concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mg/ml reduced the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of gentamicin (2 mug/ml) 2 and 4 times against s. aureus, and at concentrations of 0.5 and 2 mg/ml reduced the mic of gentamicin (4 mug/ml) 2 and 4 times, respectively, against p. aeruginosa. caffeine at concentrations of 1 and 2 mg/ml reduced the mic of gentamicin (2 mug/ml) 4 and 32 times against s. aureus, and at concentrations of 0.12 and 2 mg/ml reduced the mic of gentamicin (4 mug/ml) 2 and 4 times, respectively, against p. aeruginosa. however, dipyridamole and sildenafil (32 mug/ml) did not show any effect on mic of gentamicin against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that methylxanthines could increase gentamicin effects against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa but this effect is not mediated by inhibition of pde 5, 6, 8, 10 and 11.
synthesis, cytotoxicity and apoptosis of cyclotriphosphazene compounds as anti-cancer agents.
in the present study, a number of new dispirobino and dispiroansa spermine derivatives of cyclotriphosphazene (8-10, 13) were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, (1)h and (31)p nmr spectroscopy. at first, in vitro cytotoxic activity of cyclotriphosphazene compounds (1-14) against ht-29 (human colon adenocarcinoma), hep2 (human epidermoid larynx carcinoma), and vero (african green monkey kidney) cell lines was investigated. our study showed that most of these compounds stimulate apoptosis and they have cytotoxic effects for ht-29 and hep2 cells. additionally, these compounds (1-14) were investigated for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria and for their antifungal activity against candida albicans, and were shown to be inactive.
a comparative study of the bactericidal activity and daily disinfection housekeeping surfaces by a new portable pulsed uv radiation device.
daily cleaning and disinfecting of non-critical surfaces in the patient-care areas are known to reduce the occurrence of health care-associated infections. however, the conventional means for decontamination of housekeeping surfaces of sites of frequent hand contact such as manual disinfection using ethanol wipes are laborious and time-consuming in daily practice. this study evaluated a newly developed portable pulsed ultraviolet (uv) radiation device for its bactericidal activity in comparison with continuous uv-c, and investigated its effect on the labor burden when implemented in a hospital ward. pseudomonas aeruginosa, multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, amikacin and ciprofloxacin-resistant a. baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and bacillus cereus were irradiated with pulsed uv or continuous uv-c. pulsed uv and continuous uv-c required 5 and 30 s of irradiation, respectively, to attain bactericidal activity with more than 2log growth inhibition of all the species. the use of pulsed uv in daily disinfection of housekeeping surfaces reduced the working hours by half in comparison to manual disinfection using ethanol wipes. the new portable pulsed uv radiation device was proven to have a bactericidal activity against critical nosocomial bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria after short irradiation, and was thus found to be practical as a method for disinfecting housekeeping surfaces and decreasing the labor burden.
database screening and in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial peptides against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus usa300.
natural antimicrobial peptides (amps) are promising candidates for developing a generation of new antimicrobials to meet the challenge of antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). to facilitate the search for new candidates, we have utilised the antimicrobial peptide database (apd), which contains natural amps from bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. this study demonstrates the identification of novel templates against mrsa by screening 30 peptides selected from the apd. these peptides are short (<25 residues), cysteine-free, cationic and represent candidates from different biological sources such as bacteria, insects, arachnids, tunicates, amphibians, fish and mammals. six peptides, including ascaphin-8, database-screened antimicrobial peptide 1 (dasamp1), dasamp2, lycotoxin i, maculatin 1.3 and piscidin 1, were found to exert potent antimicrobial activity against an mrsa usa300 isolate. although five of the six peptides showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, dasamp1 displayed killing of mrsa in vitro but not of escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, dasamp1 suppressed early biofilm formation in a mouse model of catheter-associated mrsa infection. dasamp1 is a novel, short and potent peptide that will be a useful starting template for further developing novel anti-mrsa peptides.
cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc complexes with 1,3-diphenyl-1h-pyrazole-4-carboxaldehyde schiff bases: antimicrobial, spectroscopic, thermal and fluorescence studies.
two new schiff bases of 1,3-diphenyl-1h-pyrazole-4-carboxaldehyde and 4-amino-5-mercapto-3-methyl/h-1,2,4-triazole [hl(1-2)] and their cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc complexes have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, spectral (uv-vis, ir, (1)h nmr, fluorescence) studies, thermal techniques and magnetic measurements. a square planar geometry for cu(ii) and octahedral geometry for co(ii), ni(ii) and zn(ii) complexes have been proposed. in order to evaluate the biological activity of schiff bases and to assess the role of metal ion on biological activity, the pyrazole schiff bases and their metal complexes have been studied in vitro antibacterial against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal against aspergillus niger, and aspergillus flavus. in most of the cases higher activity was exhibited upon coordination with metal ions.
[development status of new antibacterials].
the increase of the infections caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria is a serious problem worldwide. as for gram-positive bacteria, the community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin- or linezolid-resistant strains have been increasing. as for gram-negative bacteria, multi-drug-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii have been increasing due to the carbapenemase production recently. during these 10 years, various types of novel antibacterials targeted for gram-positive bacteria have been approved in us and eu, but not in japan. on the other hand, the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for gram-negative bacteria is still immature. in this review, the status of the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for these multi-drug-resistant bacteria will be reviewed.
antimicrobial activity of terminalia arjuna wight & arn.: an ethnomedicinal plant against pathogens causing ear infection.
ear infection is one of the common diseases occurring throughout the world. different etiological agents are responsible for ear infections. aim: to assess the antimicrobial potential of terminalia arjuna leaves and bark extracts against staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, escherchia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, pathogens causing ear infections and their comparison with locally available ear drops. materials and methods: methanol, ethanol, acetone, aqueous (hot and cold) extracts from the leaves and bark of t. arjuna were tested for their antimicrobial activity. results: of the three organic solvents evaluated, acetonic leaf extract was found to be best against s. aureus. organic bark extract showed almost equal inhibition of all tested gram negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. however, aqueous extract of t. arjuna bark exhibited good activity against s. aureus. all the extracts were unable to exhibit any antifungal activity. conclusion: organic extract obtained from the t. arjuna bark and leaves may be used to treat the bacterial ear pathogens especially s. aureus, which has shown greater inhibition zones than the herbal drops, however, we still need more detailed studies as in vivo testing and pharmacokinetics properties for their therapeutic utility in treating ear infections.
in vitro microbiological evaluation of 1,1'-(5,5'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(3-aryl-1h-pyrazole-5,1-(4h,5h)-diyl))diethanones, novel bisacetylated pyrazoles.
novel 1,1'-(5,5'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(3-aryl-1h-pyrazole-5,1-(4h,5h)-diyl))diethanones 7-12 were tested for their antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion and twofold serial dilution method against the tested bacterial and fungal strains. compounds 7 against micrococcus luteus, 8 against beta-heamolytic streptococcus, m. luteus, klebsiella pneumonia, microsporum gypseum, 9 against staphylococcus aureus, shigella flexneri, vibreo cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aspergillus flavus, mucor indicus, 10 against salmonella typhii, s. flexneri, m. gypseum, 11 against k. pneumonia, m. gypseum, 12 against k. pneumonia, and m. gypseum show superior zone of inhibitions and exhibited excellent antibacterial and antifungal activities at a mic value of 6.25 mug/ml. moreover, all the tested compounds 7-12 revealed promising antitubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv and inh-resistant m. tuberculosis. compounds 8 against m. tuberculosis and 11 against inh-resistant m. tuberculosis exhibited the percentage of reduction in rlu at 89 and 85%, respectively.
two bacterial infection models in tree shrew for evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial agents.
animal models are essential for the development of new anti-infectious drugs. although some bacterial infection models have been established in rodents, small primate models are rare. here, we report on two bacterial infection models established in tree shrew (tupaia belangeri chinensis). a burnt skin infection model was induced by dropping 5x10(6) cfu of staphylococcus aureus on the surface of a wound after a third degree burn. this dose of s. aureus caused persistent infection for 7 days and obvious inflammatory response was observed 4 days after inoculation. a dacron graft infection model, 2x10(6) cfu of pseudomonas aeruginosa also caused persistent infection for 6 days, with large amounts of pus observed 3 days after inoculation. these models were used to evaluate the efficacy of levofloxacin (lev) and cefoperazone (cpz), which reduced the viable bacteria in skin to 4log10 and 5log10 cfu/100 mg tissue, respectively. the number of bacteria in graft was significantly reduced by 4log10 cfu/ml treatment compared to the untreated group (p<0.05). these results suggest that two bacterial infection models were successfully established in tree shrew using p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. in addition, tree shrew was susceptible to p. aeruginosa and s. aureus, thus making it an ideal bacterial infection animal model for the evaluation of new antimicrobials.
antibacterial activity of wild xylaria sp. strain r005 (ascomycetes) against multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
there is a growing need for new and effective antibiotic agents due to the recent emergence of life-threatening, multidrug-resistant bacterial infections such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in the present study, the antimicrobial potential of mushroom was investigated against multidrug-resistant bacterial strains. the mushroom was identified as xylaria sp. strain r005 based on the morphological characteristics and confirmed by 18s ribosomal rna sequence comparisons. the crude ethyl acetate extracts of culture filtrate and fruiting bodies of xylaria sp. showed significant antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant s. aureus strains (1-10) and p. aeruginosa strains (1-8). the minimum inhibitory concentration of the ethyl acetate extracts of culture filtrate and fruiting bodies ranged from 225 microg/ml to 625 microg/ml, and 120 microg/ml to 625 microg/ml, respectively, against clinical strains of s. aurues and p. aeruginosa. the synergistic action of extracts of xylaria sp. with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin was observed against s. aureus strain 6 and p. aeruginosa strain 3, respectively. the fractional inhibitory concentration indices (ficis) of culture filtrate extract with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin were 0.5 and 0.18, respectively. the fici of fruiting body extract with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin were 0.5 and 0.375, respectively. these results clearly indicate that the metabolites of culture filtrate and fruiting bodies of xylaria sp. are the potential source for production of new antimicrobial compounds.
gingival fluid cytokine expression and subgingival bacterial counts during pregnancy and postpartum: a case series.
objectives: the aim of this study was to assess gingival fluid (gcf) cytokine messenger rna (mrna) levels, subgingival bacteria, and clinical periodontal conditions during a normal pregnancy to postpartum. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gcf samples were assessed with real-time pcr including five proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. results: nineteen pregnant women with a mean age of 32 years (s.d. +/- 4 years, range 26-42) participated in the study. full-mouth bleeding scores (bop) decreased from an average of 41.2% (s.d. +/- 18.6%) at the 12th week of pregnancy to 26.6% (s.d. +/- 14.4%) at the 4-6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.001). between week 12 and 4-6 weeks postpartum, the mean probing pocket depth changed from 2.4 mm (s.d. +/- 0.4) to 2.3 mm (s.d. +/- 0.3) (p = 0.34). higher counts of eubacterium saburreum, parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and staphylococcus aureus were found at week 12 of pregnancy than at the 4-6 weeks postpartum examinations (p < 0.001). during and after pregnancy, statistically significant correlations between bop scores and bacterial counts were observed. bop scores and gcf levels of selected cytokines were not related to each other and no differences in gcf levels of the cytokines were observed between samples from the 12th week of pregnancy to 4-6 weeks postpartum. decreasing postpartum counts of porphyromonas endodontalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were associated with decreasing levels of il-8 and il-1beta. conclusions: bop decreased after pregnancy without any active periodontal therapy. associations between bacterial counts and cytokine levels varied greatly in pregnant women with gingivitis and a normal pregnancy outcome. postpartum associations between gcf cytokines and bacterial counts were more consistent. clinical relevance: combined assessments of gingival fluid cytokines and subgingival bacteria may provide important information on host response.
in vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
objective: to use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. method: in vitro biofilms, generated by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus oralis and micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (cdff), were studied. the tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees c for 24-96 hours and also in the cdff for 7 days. the extent of biofilm formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. results: all the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. in mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by s. oralis and m. luteus, with p. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. similar effects were evident in the cdff model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with m. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of s. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. conclusion: the study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.
reduction of fluoroquinolone use is associated with a decrease in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and fluoroquinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation rates: a 10 year study.
objectives: high rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and  fluoroquinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa may be related, in part, to the overuse of fluoroquinolones. the objective was to analyse and correlate long-term surveillance data on mrsa and fluoroquinolone-resistant p. aeruginosa rates and antibiotic consumption after implementation of an institution-wide programme to reduce fluoroquinolone use. methods: an interrupted time series/quasi-experimental study of monthly fluoroquinolone use and mrsa and fluoroquinolone-resistant p. aeruginosa isolation rates was carried out in a tertiary hospital during three periods: pre-intervention (january 2000-august 2005), intervention (september 2005-march 2006), and post-intervention (march 2006-march 2010). the effect of the intervention on the consumption of fluoroquinolones and bacterial resistance was assessed using segmented regression analyses. results: mean monthly fluoroquinolone consumption dropped by 29.1 defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days (ddd/1000 pd) (95% ci 13.1-45.9; p = 0.0005) from a mean of 148.2 to 119.1 ddd/1000 pd during the intervention period. a sustained and significant decrease in fluoroquinolone consumption of -0.95 ddd/1000 pd/month was also observed during the post-intervention period (p = 0.0002). during the post-intervention period the rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant p. aeruginosa continuously decreased, from a mean of 42% to 26%, with a constant relative change rate of -13%/year (95% ci -19 to -5, p = 0.001). a decrease in the mrsa rate was observed during the intervention period, from a mean resistance rate of 27% to 21% (p < 0.0001). conclusions: we showed the sustained impact of a fluoroquinolone control programme on the reduction of fluoroquinolone use with a significant decrease in fluoroquinolone-resistant p. aeruginosa and mrsa rates over 4 years.
probiotic features of two oral lactobacillus isolates.
in this study, we checked lactobacilli strains of human origin for their potential as probiotic. samples were collected from oral mucosa of 16 healthy individuals, out of which twenty isolates were obtained and two of them were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum (g1) and l. casei (g3). both isolates exhibited antagonistic action towards pathogenic microorganisms such as staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella abony, and clostridium sporogenes, but not on the growth of candida albicans. the bacteriocin activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6358-p was shown only by l. plantarum g1. moreover, the isolates g1 and g3 showed good viability in the acid gastric environment and in the gut environment containing bovine bile salts. the viability of g1 and g3 isolates in the gastrointestinal tract, and the adhesion to the intestinal mucosa were also confirmed in vivo. the biochemical tests of blood samples revealed lower levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol, as well as reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase in all lactobacilli-treated wistar rats, compared to control ones. no toxicity for nmri ham mice was observed. according to our experimental results, these findings imply that l. plantarum g1 and l. casei g3 could be characterized as potential probiotics.
antimicrobial activities of the tissue extracts of babylonia spirata linnaeus, 1758 (mollusca: gastropoda) from thazhanguda, southeast coast of india.
objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the tissue extracts of babylonia spirata (b. spirata) against nine bacterial and three fungal pathogens. methods: crude extract of gastropod was tested for inhibition of bacterial and fungal growth. antibacterial assay was carried out by disc diffusion method and in vitro antifungal activity was determined against czapex dox agar. the antimicrobial activity was measured accordingly based on the inhibition zone around the disc impregnated with gastropod extract. molecular size of muscle protein was determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) spectro photometry analysis was also studied. results: the maximum inhibition zone (12 mm) was observed against pseudomonas aeruginosa in the crude ethanol extract of b. spirata and the minimum inhibition zone (2 mm) was noticed against staphylococcus aureus in the crude methanol extract of b. spirata. water extract of b. spirata showed the highest activity against vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans. ethanol, acetone, methanol, chloroform and water extracts showed antimicrobial activity against almost all the bacteria and fungus. compared with water extracts, ethanol and methanol extracts showed higher activity against all pathogens. the molecular weight of protein of the gastropod sample ranged from 2-110 kda on sds-page. ftir analysis revealed the presence of bioactive compounds signals at different ranges. conclusions: the research shows that the great medicinal value of the gastropod muscle of b. spirata may be due to high quality of antimicrobial compounds.
antimicrobial activity of new phorbins from jatropha curcas linn. (euphorbiaceae) leaves.
the crude methanol extract of jatropha curcas leaves exhibited activity against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium phlei, candida albicans, and trichophyton mentagrophytes but was inactive against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. in a bioassay-directed fractionation, two new phorbins were isolated and analysed by spectroscopic methods. isolate 1 was characterized as an analogue of pheophytin b with a phytyl moiety containing three double bonds which are at positions p2/p3, p6/p7, and p10/p11. compound 2 was characterized as methyl pheophorbide a with 132-oh and 17- and 17(1)-ch3 moieties. it is active against serratia marcescens.
the antimicrobial activity of essential oils and extracts of some medicinal plants grown in ash-shoubak region - south of jordan.
the inhibitory effects of essential oils as well as chloroformic extracts of thymus vulgaris, thymus serpyllum, salvia officinalis and pimpinella anisum grown in ash-shoubak region-south of jordan and their possible individual phytochemical constituents was screened against pathogenic clinical and standard strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. the bioassay employed was the agar well diffusion method. the essential oils and chloroformic extracts of t. vulgaris and t. serpyllum were the most effective against the tested strains of bacteria. clinical and standard strains of s .aureus and p. aeruginosa were uninhibited by s. officinalis essential oils. p. aeruginosa tested strains were also resistant to p. anisum essential oils. for almost all bacterial strains, the highest antibacterial effect of oils was obtained with the highest tested dose (15 mul). chlorformic extracts of s. officinalis showed small activity against standard and clinical e. coli strains and were not effective to inhibit strains of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. chloroformic extracts obtained from p. anisum and applied at 300 mug/cm(2) slightly inhibited e. coli, but moderately inhibited s. aureus. it is shown from the results that the antibacterial effects of the individual components varied depending upon their chemical structure, functional groups and configuration as well as doses used. this study showed the beneficial effects of the essential oils of t. serpyllum and t. vulgaris grown in ash-shoubak in inhibiting the growth of microbes and the implications this could have in pharmacy and food technology.
the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
in vitro antibacterial activities of aqueous extracts from algerian desert truffles (terfezia and tirmania, ascomycetes) against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.
the aim of this study is to evaluate the in vitro effects of aqueous extracts of  three species of algerian desert truffles (terfezia claveryi, t. leonis, and tirmania nivea) on the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. the antimicrobial activity of the three aqueous extracts was tested using the agar well diffusion and kinetic bacterial growth curves methods. the aqueous extracts of terfezia claveryi and tirmania nivea were found to possess a very powerful antibacterial activity against both s. aureus and p. aeruginosa using agar well diffusion. using 4% and 11% of the aqueous extracts of t. claveryi and t. nivea in the growth medium of s. aureus caused a significant inhibition of s. aureus growth by 86.48% and 99.09%, respectively. the aqueous extracts of t. claveryi and t. nivea were found to cause a significant inhibition of the growth of p. aeruginosa by 71.11% and 100%, respectively. however, the aqueous extract of terfecia leonis did not show any antibacterial activity. therefore, t. claveryi and tirmania nivea can be considered a source of natural therapeutic agents that can be used to treat eye infections caused by resistant bacteria such as p. aeruginosa and s. aureus.
antibacterial activity of some indian ayurvedic preparations against enteric bacterial pathogens.
in ayurveda, various herbal preparations are clinically used to prevent or cure infectious diseases. herbal preparations such as triphala churna, hareetaki churna, dashmula churna, manjistadi churna, sukhsarak churna, ajmodadi churna, shivkshar pachan churna, mahasudarshan churna, swadist virechan churna and pipramool churna were investigated by preparing their organic solvent extract for antibacterial potential against enteric bacterial pathogens such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus epidermidis, salmonella typhimurium and proteus vulgaris, respectively. in the present study, triphala churna, hareetaki churna, dashmula churna were potent antibacterial agents against s. epidermidis, p. vulgaris, s. aureus, e. coli, p. aeruginosa and s. typhi. the study supports the use of these herbal preparations not only as dietary supplements but also as agents to prevent or control enteric bacterial infections.
essential oil analysis and antibacterial activity of rosmarinus tournefortii from algeria.
the volatile compounds obtained by hydrodistillation of the aerial parts of rosmarinus tournefortii de noe. growing wild in the occidental region of algeria were analyzed by gc/ms. thirty-six compounds were characterized representing 95.6% of the essential oil, with camphor (37.6%), 1,8-cineole (10.0%), p-cymene-7-ol (7.8%), and borneol (5.4%) as the major components. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated against three pathogenic bacteria: gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic; mg/ml) was determined by sub-culture on muller hinton agar plates. the essential oil exhibited strong antibacterial activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa, and was also active against staphylococcus aureus.
antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin and tobramycin in combination against cystic fibrosis pathogens under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
background: there is a need for new antibiotics or combination of antibiotics that possess activity against increasingly resistant cystic fibrosis (cf) respiratory pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and mrsa. methods: the antimicrobial activity of a novel 4:1 (w/w) fosfomycin:tobramycin (f:t) combination against cf respiratory pathogens under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions was determined by mic, time-kill and biofilm studies, and compared with activity of fosfomycin and tobramycin, individually. results: f:t and fosfomycin had excellent activity against p. aeruginosa and were more active than tobramycin against p. aeruginosa under anaerobic conditions with lower mic(50), mic(90) and geometric mean values. f:t (p<0.001) and fosfomycin (p<0.001) mics for p. aeruginosa were significantly lower under anaerobic conditions with tobramycin mics significantly higher (p<0.001). f:t and fosfomycin also had high activity against mrsa with both being more active than tobramycin. in time-kill studies, f:t was rapidly bactericidal against all 15 p. aeruginosa and 3/5 mrsa isolates tested. f:t also demonstrated bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa grown in biofilm under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. conclusions: f:t has promising in vitro antimicrobial activity against mrsa and p. aeruginosa with greater activity under anaerobic conditions similar to those found in the cf lung.
antibacterial activity of some african medicinal plants used traditionally against infectious diseases.
context: plants are known to play a crucial role in african traditional medicine  for the treatment of infection diseases. objectives: to investigate the claimed antimicrobial properties of plants traditionally used in african countries, providing scientific validation for their use. materials and methods: eighty-three polar and non-polar extracts from 22 medicinal plants were screened for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae) and mycobacterium smegmatis using the broth microdilution method. results and discussion: in vitro antibacterial activity against one or more tested bacteria was shown by 83% of the extracts. the highest activity was obtained with the methanol extracts of the aerial parts of acacia karroo hayne (fabaceae) and anacardium occidentale l. (anacardiaceae) and the roots of bridelia cathartica g. bertol (euphorbiaceae), against s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 7.5 microg/ml). the same mic values were exhibited against e. faecalis by the methanol extract of a. occidentale, the dichloromethane and methanol extracts of b. cathartica and the ethyl acetate extract of momordica balsamina l. (curcubitaceae) leaves. gram-negative bacteria were less sensitive; the growth of p. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited (mic = 31 microg/ml) by the n-hexane and methanol extracts of gomphocarpus fruticosus (l.) ait. (asclepiadaceae) fruits and by the dichloromethane extract of trichilia emetica vahl (meliaceae) seeds. most of the active extracts were rich in fenols/flavonoids. conclusion: this study supports the use of most of the studied plants in traditional medicine, for the treatment of infectious diseases. some of them are worthy of further investigation.
inhibitory effects of uv treatment and a combination of uv and dry heat against pathogens on stainless steel and polypropylene surfaces.
pathogens that contaminate the surfaces of food utensils may contribute to the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks. we investigated the efficacy of uv treatment combined with dry heat (50 degrees c) for inhibiting 5 foodborne pathogens (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus) on stainless steel and polypropylene surfaces in this study. we inoculated substrates with each of the 5 foodborne pathogens cultured on agar surface and then uv treatment alone or a combination of both uv and dry heat (50 degrees c) was applied for 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h. the initial populations of the 5 pathogens before treatment were 8.02 to 9.18 and 8.73 to 9.16 log(1)(0) cfu/coupon on the surfaces of stainless steel and polypropylene coupons, respectively. uv treatments for 3 h significantly inhibited s. typhimurium, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus on the stainless steel by 3.06, 2.18, and 2.70 log(1)(0) cfu/coupon, and s. aureus on the polypropylene by 3.11 log(1)(0) cfu/coupon, respectively. the inhibitory effects of the combined uv and dry heat treatment (50 degrees c) increased as treatment time increased, yielding significant reductions in all samples treated for 3 h, with the exception of s. aureus on polypropylene. the reduction level of e. coli o157:h7 treated for 3 h on the surface of stainless steel and polypropylene treated was approximately 6.00 log(1)(0) cfu/coupon. these results indicate that combined uv and dry heat (50 degrees c) treatments may be effective for controlling microbial contamination on utensils and cooking equipment surfaces as well as in other related environments.
antimicrobial activity and the mechanism of silver nanoparticle thermosensitive gel.
purpose: the purpose of the present study was to elucidate the antimicrobial activity and mechanism of silver nanoparticles incorporated into thermosensitive gel (s-t-gel) on staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. patients and methods: this study investigated the growth, permeability, and morphology of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cells in order to observe the action of s-t-gel on the membrane structure of these three bacteria. the cell morphology of normal and treated bacteria cells was assessed by transmission electron microscopy (tem), and the effects of s-t-gel on genome dna of bacterial cells were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. results: s-t-gel showed promising activity against staphylococcus aureus and moderate activity against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the observation with tem suggested that s-t-gel may destroy the structure of bacterial cell membranes in order to enter the bacterial cell. s-t-gel then condensed dna and combined and coagulated with the cytoplasm of the damaged bacteria, resulting in the leakage of the cytoplasmic component and the eventual death of these three bacteria. in addition, the analysis of agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated that s-t-gel could increase the decomposability of genome dna. conclusion: these results about promising antimicrobial activity and mechanism of s-t-gel may be useful for further research and development in in-vivo studies.
improved antibiotic-impregnated catheters with extended-spectrum activity against resistant bacteria and fungi.
minocycline-rifampin-impregnated central venous catheters (m/r cvcs) have been shown to be efficacious in reducing catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsi) and inhibiting the biofilm adherence of resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. to expand the spectrum of antimicrobial activity, a novel second-generation m/r catheter was developed by adding chlorhexidine (chx-m/r). cvcs and peripherally inserted central catheters (piccs) were impregnated with chx-m/r and compared with first-generation m/r catheters, chx-silver sulfadiazine-treated cvcs (chx/ss-cvcs), chlorhexidine-treated piccs, and uncoated catheters. a biofilm catheter colonization model was used to assess the efficacy of catheters against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre), p. aeruginosa, candida albicans, and candida glabrata. chx-m/r-impregnated cvcs were the only antimicrobial catheters that completely inhibited the biofilm colonization of all resistant bacterial and fungal organisms tested at all time intervals, and they were significantly superior to uncoated catheters (all p values were </=0.003). furthermore, chx-m/r-coated cvcs had a significantly more effective and prolonged (up to 3 weeks) antimicrobial activity against mrsa and p. aeruginosa than m/r, chx/ss, and uncoated cvcs (p < 0.0001). similarly, chx-m/r-coated piccs were also superior to m/r-coated and chx-coated piccs in preventing biofilms of mrsa, vre, p. aeruginosa, and candida species (p value = 0.003 for all). our study shows that novel chx-m/r-coated catheters have unique properties in completely inhibiting biofilm colonization of mrsa, vre, p. aeruginosa, and fungi in a manner superior to that of m/r- and chlorhexidine-treated catheters.
evaluation of wound healing and antimicrobial potentials of ixora coccinea root extract.
objective: to evaluate the wound healing and antimicrobial activity of root extracts of ixora coccinea (i. coccinea). methods: to investigate the wound healing efficacy of root extract of i. coccinea linn, five groups of animals were divided each containing six animals. two wound models including incision and excision wound models were used in this study. the parameters studied were tensile strength on incision wound model and in terms of wound contraction for excision wound model were compared with standard nitrofurazone (nfz) ointment (0.2% w/w). six extracts (ethanol, aqueous, petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform and ethyl acetate) of i. coccinea were screened for in vitro growth inhibiting activity against different bacterial strains viz, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus pumilius, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungi candida albicans and aspergillus niger were compared with the standard drugs ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol for antibacterial and griseofulvin for antifungal screening. the serial dilution and cup (or) well plate methods were used for the antimicrobial study and mic was determined. results: the ethanolic extract showed significant (p<0.001) wound healing activity when compared to standard drug nfz with respect to normal control group. amongst all, ethanolic extract showed highly significant antibacterial activity against all bacterial strains used in this study when compared to standard. the aqueous extract showed moderate significant inhibition against all bacterial strains when compared to standard. all the extracts were shown negligible activity against the fungal strains used in this study. conclusions: the ethanolic root extract of i. coccinea showed pronounced wound healing and antibacterial activity. the probable reason to heal the wound was that the external application of the extract prevented the microbes to invade through the wound thus the protection of wound occurs against the infection of the various organisms.
the rising problem of antimicrobial resistance in the intensive care unit.
mainly due to its extremely vulnerable population of critically ill patients, and the high use of (invasive) procedures, the intensive care unit (icu) is the epicenter of infections. these infections are associated with an important rise in morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. the additional problem of multidrug-resistant pathogens boosts the adverse impact of infections in icus. several factors influence the rapid spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens in the icu, e.g., new mutations, selection of resistant strains, and suboptimal infection control. among gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant microorganisms in the icu are currently methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. in gram-negative bacteria, the resistance is mainly due to the rapid increase of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in klebsiella pneumonia, escherichia coli, and proteus species and high level third-generation cephalosporin beta-lactamase resistance among enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp., and multidrug resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. to conclude, additional efforts are needed in the future to slow down the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. constant evaluation of current practice on basis of trends in mdr and antibiotic consumption patterns is essential to make progress in this problematic matter.
pathogenic alteration in severe burn wounds.
the present study aims to define the trend of time related changes with local bacterial alteration of bacterial resistance in severe burns in our burn center during a 12-year period. retrospective analysis of microbiological results on severely burned wounds between 1998 and 2009 was carried out. a study of 3615 microbial isolates was performed. staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated pathogen (38.2%) followed by a. baumannii (16.2%), streptococcus viridans (11.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.4%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns, 9.2%). the species ratios of s. aureus and a. baumannii increased significantly from 1st to 8th week of hospitalization, while those of streptococcus viridans, p. aeruginosa and coagulase-negative staphylococci decreased during the same period. bacterial resistance rates were compared between the periods 1998-2003 and 2004-2009. vancomycin remained as the most sensitive antibiotic in s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). it was very likely that the majority of infections caused by streptococcus viridans, p. aeruginosa and coagulase-negative staphylococci occurred in the early stage of burn course and the majority of infections caused by a. baumannii occurred 4 weeks after admission. the use of different antibiotics was probably the major contributor to these trends.
highly dynamic biodegradable micelles capable of lysing gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial membrane.
the development of biodegradable antimicrobial polymers adds to the toolbox of attractive antimicrobial agents against antibiotic-resistant microbes. to this end, the potential of polycarbonate polymers as such materials were explored. a series of random polycarbonate polymers consisting of monomers mtc-oet and mtc-ch(2)ch(3)cl were designed and synthesized using metal-free organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization. random polycarbonate polymers self-assembled in solution but appeared highly dynamic; such behaviors are desirable as ready disassembly of polymers at the microbial membrane facilitates membrane disruption. their activities against clinically relevant gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (e.coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) revealed that the hydrophobic-hydrophilic composition balance in polymers are important to render antimicrobial potency. scanning electron microscopy (sem) studies indicated microbial cell surface damage after treatment with polymers, and confocal microscopy studies also showed entry of fitc-dextran dye in escherichia coli as a result of membrane disruption. on the other hand, the polymers exhibited minimal toxicity against red blood cells in hemolysis tests. therefore, these random polycarbonate polymers are promising antimicrobial agents against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria for various biomedical applications.
dna, protein binding, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and antibacterial activities  of new palladium(ii) complexes of thiosemicarbazone ligands: effects of substitution on biological activity.
the coordination propensities of 4(n,n')-diethylaminosalicylaldehyde-4(n)-substituted thiosemicarbazones (h(2)l(1-4)) were investigated by reacting with an equimolar amount of [pdcl(2)(pph(3))(2)]. the new complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. the structure determination of the complexes [pd(deasal-tsc)(pph(3))] (1), [pd(deasal-mtsc)(pph(3))] (2) and [pd(deasal-etsc)(pph(3))] (3) by x-ray crystallography showed that ligands are coordinated in a dibasic tridentate ons donor fashion forming stable five and six membered chelate rings. the binding ability of complexes (1-4) to calf-thymus dna (ct dna) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods. based on the observations, an electrostatic and an intercalative binding mode have been proposed. the protein binding studies have been monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the presence of complexes using lysozyme as a model protein. as determined by mtt assays, complex 3 exhibited a higher cytotoxic effect towards human lung cancer cell line (a549) and liver cancer cells (hepg2). ldh, no assay and cellular uptake of the complexes have been studied. further, antibacterial activity studies of the complexes have been screened against the pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, mic50 values of the complexes showed that the complexes exhibited significant activity against the pathogens and among the complexes, 3 exhibited higher activity.
antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (staphylococcus aureus ep167, acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, escherichia coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) and candida albicans my1055) and two probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum lch17 and lactobacillus brevis lch23). a total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. a total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. the gram-positive bacterium s. aureus ep167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rrna sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders pleosporales, hypocreales and xylariales dominated. differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed among isolates from the same species. some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.
[antimicrobial activity and frequency of spontaneous gentamicin-resistant mutants in bacteria related skin infections].
gentamicin is used in an ointment form for the treatment of skin infections. to investigate the effect of gentamicin used as an ointment, the antimicrobial susceptibilities against staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from community and medical settings were studied and compared with other antibacterial agents such as fradiomycin, chloramphenicol, and bacitracin used as active ingredient for each ointment. gentamicin showed antibacterial activities for all standard bacteria tested, but fradiomycin and chloramphenicol showed no such activities for st. pyogenes and p. aeruginosa, respectively. bacitracin showed activity for st. pyogenes only. the strains of staphylococci isolated from healthy people were highly susceptible to gentamicin, while 49.3% of the isolates from the patients with skin infections were resistant to gentamicin and 96.4% of the gentamicin-resistant staphylococci carried the aminoglycoside-resistance gene aaca-aphd. the growths of all strains tested, except for two strains of p. aeruginosa, were inhibited by close below 128 microg/ml of gentamicin. furthermore, the frequencies of spontaneous mutants resistant to gentamicin, fradiomycin, and chloramphenicol were each investigated using s. aureus, s. epidermidis, st. pyogenes, and p. aeruginosa. at doses of more than 32 microg/ml of gentamicin, no resistant mutants in any of bacteria strains tested were obtained. the concentration of gentamicin on the skin was calculated at approximately 895 microg/ml at least when the commercially used 0.1% gentamicin ointment was applied to the skin. therefore, our study strongly indicates that the gentamicin ointment used has a potency of sufficiently inhibiting the growth of bacteria, including gentamicin-resistant strains, which cause skin infections in the community.
synthesis of lipophilic dimeric c-7/c-7-linked ciprofloxacin and c-6/c-6-linked levofloxacin derivatives. versatile in vitro biological evaluations of monomeric and dimeric fluoroquinolone derivatives as potential antitumor, antibacterial or antimycobacterial agents.
the synthesis of c-7/c-7-linked ciprofloxacin (cp) and c-6/c-6-linked levofloxacin (lv) derivatives with modulated lipophilicity is described herein. the synthesized compounds, along with the monomeric analogs described previously, were evaluated in vitro for (i) their growth inhibitory effect against five human cancer cell lines, (ii) their antibacterial activity against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus hirae and gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and (iii) their antimycobacterial activity. the most efficient derivatives as antiproliferative agents (c-7/c-7-linked cp 7e and c-6/c-6-linked lv 11f) displayed ic(50) values in the 0.1-8.7 and 0.2-0.7 mum ranges respectively while ic(50) values for parent cp and lv ranged from 89 to 476 mum and from 67 to 622 mum respectively depending on the cell line. a specific antibacterial activity against s. aureus was found for the monomeric and dimeric derivatives of cp. the most efficient derivative against s. aureus (monomeric oxoethyloctanoate cp derivative 3d) displayed mic <1 nm. monomeric alkanoyloxymethyl lv esters (9a,c,e,f) and c-6/c-6-linked lv derivatives (11f-h) were the most efficient derivatives as antimycobacterial agents with mic and ic(50) values in the 2.5-5 mum and 1.3-</= 2.5 mum ranges respectively while mic and ic(50) values for parent lv were 2.5 and 0.8 mum, respectively.
wfdc2 is differentially expressed in the mammary gland of the tammar wallaby and  provides immune protection to the mammary gland and the developing pouch young.
wap four disulfide core domain 2 (wfdc2) is a four disulfide core (4-dsc) protein secreted in the milk of the tammar wallaby. it is comprised of two 4-dsc domains assigned domain iii at the nh2-terminal end and domain ii at the cooh-terminal end. the wfdc2 gene was expressed only during pregnancy, early lactation, towards the end of lactation and involution. the wfdc2 protein showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and pseudomonas aeruginosa and this activity resided with domain ii. there was no antibacterial activity detected against enterococcus faecalis. the observed expression pattern of tammar wfdc2 and its antibacterial activity suggests a role to either reduce mastitis in the mammary gland caused by s. aureus or to protect the gut of the young at a time when it is not immune-competent. the latter effect could be achieved without disturbing the balance of commensal gut flora such as e. faecalis.
antimicrobial effect of statins: organic solvents might falsify microbiological testing results.
objectives: statins possess a variety of pleiotropic effects. direct antimicrobial effect of simvastatin and, to a smaller degree, fluvastatin, has been reported for gram-positive bacteria. the present study investigated antimicrobial activity of all statins available on the european market on gram-positive and -negative organisms, with particular attention on the possible impact of organic solvents on bacterial growth. methods: simvastatin was dissolved both in 100% methanol (simvastatin 100%) and in 5% methanol (simvastatin 5%), the latter solution requiring ph adjustment for solubility reasons. antimicrobial activity of both simvastatin solutions and of five other statins was evaluated against escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 by broth microdilution testing. in addition, time-kill curves of methanol alone, simvastatin 100% and simvastatin 5% were performed for s. aureus atcc 29213. results: relevant antimicrobial activity was observed only for simvastatin 100% when tested against s. aureus (mic = 31 mg/l). mic of simvastatin 5% was more than 10-fold higher (500 mg/l). in analogy, time-kill rates of simvastatin against s. aureus decreased markedly when the methanol content in the test solutions was reduced. in both experimental settings, antimicrobial activity observed for pure methanol was only slightly inferior to that of simvastatin 100%. conclusion: previously published results about the antimicrobial effect of statins relied on the use of pure methanol as solvent. present data indicate that the observed antimicrobial effect must be attributed, at least to a very large extent, to the solvent. toxicity of solvents may influence microbiological evaluation of poorly water-soluble substances. ph adjustment to enhance solubility and thus reduce the need for using organic solvent might sometimes overcome this problem.

some novel chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidinone, pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine, dihydropyrimidine, pyridopyranopyrimidine and pyrimidopyranopyrimidine have been synthesized. the structures of target compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses and spectral data. the antimicrobial activity of all the target synthesized compounds were tested against various microorganismst such as pseudomonas aeruginosa; staphylococcus aureus (bacteria), aspergillus flavus (fungus) and candida albicans (yeast fungus) by the disc diffusion method. in general, the novel synthesized compounds showed a good antimicrobial activity against the previously mentioned microorganisms.
in vitro activity of s-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)isothiourea hydrochloride and novel structurally related compounds against multidrug-resistant bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and burkholderia cepacia complex.
the aim of this study was to establish the antimicrobial activities of s-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)isothiourea hydrochloride (a22) and a series of structurally related compounds against multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 21 compounds were determined against 18 strains of pathogenic bacteria in addition to pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=19) and burkholderia cepacia complex (bcc) (n=20) isolated from the sputa of cystic fibrosis patients. selected compounds were tested against further isolates, including p. aeruginosa (n=100), bcc (n=12) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=19). the interaction of s-(4-chlorobenzyl)isothiourea hydrochloride (c2) in combination with conventional antimicrobials was examined against 10 p. aeruginosa strains. selected compounds were also tested against enterobacteriaceae producing ndm-1 carbapenemase (n=64) and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n=37). of the 21 compounds, 14 showed antimicrobial activity that was generally more pronounced against gram-negative bacteria. against p. aeruginosa, the most active compound was c2 [mic for 50% of the organisms (mic(50))=32mug/ml]. this compound was also the most active against bcc, with all isolates inhibited by 64mug/ml. for all ten strains of p. aeruginosa subjected to combination testing with c2 and conventional antimicrobials, a bactericidal effect was achieved with at least one combination. c2 and a22 both showed strong activity [mic for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=4mug/ml] against enterobacteriaceae that produced ndm-1 carbapenemase. finally, s-(4-chlorobenzyl)-n-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)isothiourea hydrochloride showed good activity (mic(90)=8mug/ml) against mrsa. this work establishes the activity of isothiourea derivatives against a broad range of clinically important mdr bacteria.
novel hydrogel particles and their ipn films as drug delivery systems with antibacterial properties.
poly(acrylonitrile) (p(an))-based materials such poly(acrylonitrile-co-(3-acrylamidopropyl)-trimethylammonium chloride (p(an-co-aptmacl)), poly(acrylonitrile-co-4-viniyl pyridine) (p(an-co-4-vp)) and poly(acrylonitrile-co-n-isopropylacrylamide) (p(an-co-nipam)) core-shell nanoparticles were prepared. the core materials, an, in p(an-co-4-vp) nanoparticles, were amidoximated and the shell materials, 4-vp, were quaternized to generate p(an-co-4-vp)(+) and p(an-co-4-vp)(++), single and double positively charged core-shell nanoparticles, respectively. furthermore, interpenetrating microgels-hydrogel (ipn) polymeric networks were prepared by mixing double quaternized p(an-co-4-vp)(++) core-shell particles with acrylamide (aam) and 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (hema) before polymerization. a model drug, fluorescein sodium salt (fss) was used in absorption/release studies from these ipns. moreover, the prepared and chemically modified particles were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc6538, pseduomonas aeruginosa atcc9027, bacillus subtilis atcc6633, and escherichia coli atcc8739, and found that some of these particles had antibacterial properties against tested bacteria.
peptidylarginine deiminases present in the airways during tobacco smoking and inflammation can citrullinate the host defense peptide ll-37, resulting in altered activities.
bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract is frequently seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), and may cause exacerbations leading to disease progression. antimicrobial peptides comprise an important part of innate lung immunity, and not least the cathelicidin human cationic antimicrobial protein-18/ll-37. peptidylarginine deiminases (padis) post-translationally modify proteins by converting cationic peptidylarginine residues to neutral peptidylcitrulline. an increased presence of padi2 and citrullinated proteins was demonstrated in the lungs of smokers. in this study, preformed padi4, stored in granulocytes and extracellularly in the lumina of bronchi, was found in lung tissue of individuals suffering from copd. in vitro, recombinant human padi2 and padi4 both caused a time- and dose-dependent citrullination of ll-37. the citrullination resulted in impaired antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and nontypable haemophilus influenzae, but less so against pseudomonas aeruginosa. using artificial lipid bilayers, we observed discrete differences when comparing the disrupting activity of native and citrullinated ll-37, suggesting that differences in cell wall composition are important during interactions with whole bacteria. furthermore, citrullinated ll-37 showed higher chemotactic activity against mononuclear leukocytes than did native ll-37, but was less efficient at neutralizing lipolysaccharide, and also in converting apoptotic neutrophils into a state of secondary necrosis. in addition, citrullinated ll-37 was more prone to degradation by proteases, whereas the v8 endopetidase of s. aureus cleaved the modified peptide at additional sites, compared with native ll-37. together, these findings demonstrate novel mechanisms whereby the inflammation-dependent deiminases padi2 and padi4 can alter the activites of antibacterial polypeptides, affecting the course of inflammatory disorders such as copd.
staphylolysin is an effective therapeutic agent for staphylococcus aureus experimental keratitis.
background: therapy of s. aureus keratitis is increasingly challenging due to emerging resistant strains. staphylolysin (lasa protease) is a staphylolytic endopeptidase secreted by pseudomonas aeruginosa. the purpose of the current study was to study the effect of treatment with staphylolysin on experimental keratitis caused by various staphylococcus aureus strains. methods: the therapeutic effect was studied in a keratitis model induced in rabbits by intrastromal injections of 10(3) s. aureus cells of three different methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains and one methicillin-susceptible s. aureus strain (mssa). topical treatment with either staphylolysin or bovine serum albumin (bsa; control) was applied every half hour for 5 h, starting at 4 h after infection. corneas were removed for bacterial quantification. histopathological analysis was performed on mssa-infected rabbits, killed at either one or 84 h after completion of treatment and on uninfected eyes 1 h after treatment termination. results: the number of bacteria in the staphylolysin-treated corneas was significantly reduced in all infections with the four s. aureus strains studied as compared to controls: the staphylolysin-treated eyes infected with mrsa strains were either completely sterilized or showed a 3-4 orders of magnitude decrease in the number of cfu/cornea (p = 0.004 to 0.005); all of the staphylolysin-treated mssa-infected eyes were sterile. histopathological analysis of the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) strain-infected eyes at 84 h after completion of treatment showed moderate inflammation in the staphylolysin-treated eyes as compared with extensive abscess formation in the control group. the uninfected corneas showed only mild stromal edema in both the staphylolysin and bsa-treated groups. conclusions: staphylolysin provided long-lasting protection against several strains of s. aureus, evident by both its strong anti-bacterial activity and beneficial histopathological results of treatment.
the revival of fosfomycin.
fosfomycin, originally named phosphonomycin, was discovered in spain in 1969. there are three forms of fosfomycin: fosfomycin tromethamine (a soluble salt) and fosfomycin calcium for oral use, and fosfomycin disodium for intravenous use. fosfomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by inhibiting the initial step involving phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase. it has a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. it is highly active against gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus, and against gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae. its unique mechanism of action may provide a synergistic effect to other classes of antibiotics including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. oral fosfomycin is mainly used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, particularly those caused by escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. intravenous fosfomycin has been administered in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. fosfomycin has good distribution into tissues, achieving clinically relevant concentrations in serum, kidneys, bladder wall, prostate, lungs, inflamed tissues, bone, cerebrospinal fluid, abscess fluid, and heart valves. fosfomycin is well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. further randomized controlled trials are needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous fosfomycin for the management of nosocomial infections due to mdr pathogens.
relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site at a university hospital from 1980 to 2008.
background: we describe the relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site over 29 years using hospital-wide surveillance data from a large academic hospital. methods: comprehensive hospital-wide surveillance was provided by trained infection preventionists using centers for disease control and prevention definitions. five 5-year blocks and one 4-year block were created for each site: bloodstream infections (bsi), urinary tract infections (uti), respiratory tract infections (rti), and surgical site infections (ssi). the blocks of relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens were compared by chi(2) analysis, and trends for each pathogen were estimated by regression analysis. results: at least 1 pathogen was isolated from 28,208 (83.5%) of 33,797 health care-associated infections (hai). staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), enterococcus species, and clostridium difficile and other anaerobes significantly increased, whereas escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella species, enterobacter species, and other streptococci significantly decreased in the relative proportion of pathogens during the study period. by infection site, results showed significant increasing trends of s aureus in uti, rti, and ssi; cons in bsi and ssi; candida in ssi; and enterococcus in bsi and uti. conclusion: significant changes in relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site occurred over the 29-year period. these findings have implications for implementation of infection prevention strategies.
anthraquinone profile, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of bark extracts  of rhamnus catharticus and r. orbiculatus.
the anthraquinone profile, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities as well as the total phenol and total flavonoid contents were determined in methanol extracts of the barks of rhamnus catharticus l. and r. orbiculatus bornm. the most abundant anthraquinone derivatives in r. catharticus were physcion (67.8%) and emodin (26.2%), while r. orbiculatus contained mostly physcion (81.3%) and chrysophanol (14.6%). r. catharticus displayed better activity in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid assay, as well as chelating activity, whereas its activity in the reducing power assay was significantly lower than that of r. orbiculatus. both methanol extracts showed antimicrobial activity against all microbial species tested (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, candida albicans, aspergillus niger, microsporum gypseum) with mic values either equal to or lower than 2.50 mg/ml. r. catharticus and r. orbiculatus contained several anthranoid aglycones and their bark extracts demonstrated notable antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. the results obtained indicate the medicinal potential of these two species.
bactericidal activities of woven cotton and nonwoven polypropylene fabrics coated with hydroxyapatite-binding silver/titanium dioxide ceramic nanocomposite "earth-plus".
background: bacteria from the hospital environment, including linens and curtains, are often responsible for hospital-associated infections. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the bactericidal effects of fabrics coated with the hydroxyapatite-binding silver/titanium dioxide ceramic nanocomposite "earth-plus". methods: bactericidal activities of woven and nonwoven fabrics coated with earth-plus were investigated by the time-kill curve method using nine bacterial strains, including three staphylococcus aureus, three escherichia coli, and three pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. results: the numbers of viable s. aureus and e. coli cells on both fabrics coated with earth-plus decreased to below 2 log(10) colony-forming units/ml in six hours and reached the detection limit in 18 hours. viable cell counts of p. aeruginosa on both fabrics coated with earth-plus could not be detected after 3-6 hours. viable cells on woven fabrics showed a more rapid decline than those on nonwoven fabrics. bacterial cell counts of the nine strains on fabrics without earth-plus failed to decrease even after 18 hours. conclusion: woven cotton and nonwoven polypropylene fabrics were shown to have excellent antibacterial potential. the woven fabric was more bactericidal than the nonwoven fabric.
a new triterpene from barringtonia asiatica.
the freeze-dried bark of barringtonia asiatica afforded a new triterpene: (3beta,11alpha)-11-hydroxyolean-12-en-3-yl palmitate (1). the bark also yielded mixtures of (3beta)-olean-12-en-3-yl palmitate (2a), (3beta)-urs-12-en-3-yl palmitate (2b) and (3beta)-olean-18-en-3-yl palmitate (2c) in a 2:1:4 ratio; beta-amyrin (3a), alpha-amyrin (3b) and germanicol (3c) in a 3:1:4 ratio; 22-o-tigloylcamelliagenin a (4a) and betulinic acid (4b) in a 2:1 ratio; olean-12-en-3beta,16beta,22alpha-triol (5), beta-sitosterol, spinasterol, squalene and trilinolein. the roots yielded 2a-c and 3a-c as well as trilinolein, spinasterol and squalene, while the flowers afforded verimol k (6), linoleic acid, spinasterol, squalene, phytyl fatty acid ester and trilinolein. compounds 1-4 and 6 were tested for antimicrobial property against seven microorganisms. all compounds tested exhibited slight activity against candida albicans and were found inactive against escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, trichophyton mentagrophytes and aspergillus niger. except for the mixture of 4a and 4b that proved to be inactive, all the compounds were slightly active against the bacterium staphylococcus aureus, while 3a-c were slightly active against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
bioburden-responsive antimicrobial plga ultrafine fibers for wound healing.
despite innovation in the design and functionalization of polymer nanofiber wound healing materials, information on their interaction with the biochemical wound environment is lacking. in an earlier study, we have reported the interaction of fusidic acid-loaded plga ultrafine fibers (ufs) with wound bacteria. massive bacterial colonization and the formation of a dense biofilm throughout the mat were demonstrated. this was associated with a marked enhancement of initial drug release at concentrations allowing eradication of planktonic bacteria and considerable suppression of biofilm. the present study aimed at extending earlier findings to gain more mechanistic insights into the potential response of the fusidic acid-laden ufs under study to controlled microbial bioburden. initial drug release enhancement was shown to involve surface erosion of the ultrafibrous mats likely mediated by microbial esterase activity determined in the study. release data could be correlated with microbial bioburden over the inoculum size range 10(3)-10(7) cfu/ml, suggesting a bioburden-triggered drug release enhancement mechanism. moreover, the effectiveness of fusidic acid-laden ufs in the healing of either lightly contaminated or staphylococcus aureus heavily infected wounds in a rat model suggested in-use relevant antimicrobial release patterns. findings indicated active participation of polymer ultrafine wound dressings in a dynamic interaction with the wound milieu, which affects their structure-function relationship. understanding such an interaction is fundamental to the characterization and performance assessment of wound materials under biorelevant conditions and the design of polymer-based infection-responsive biomaterials.
conidiogenones h and i, two new diterpenes of cyclopiane class from a marine-derived endophytic fungus penicillium chrysogenum qen-24s.
two new tetracyclic diterpenes of the rarely reported cyclopiane class, conidiogenones h and i (1 and 2, resp.), along with five related congeners, conidiogenones b - d and f (3-5 and 6, resp.) and conidiogenol (7), were characterized from the culture extracts of penicillium chrysogenum qen-24s, an endophytic fungus derived from an unidentified marine red algal species of the genus laurencia. the structures of these compounds were established on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis. the inhibitory activity of theses diterpenes against four bacteria and one pathogen fungus was evaluated. conidiogenone b (3) showed potent activity against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas fluorescens, p. aeruginosa, and staphylococcus epidermidis (each with a mic value of 8 mug/ml), while conidiogenol (7) showed obvious activity against p. fluorescens and s. epidermidis (each with a mic value of 16 mug/ml). this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of cyclopiane diterpenes.
dna/protamine complex paste for an injectable dental material.
a dna/protamine complex powder was prepared by reaction between dna and protamine sulfate solution with stirring in order to develop a new injectable biomaterials for dental therapy. the powder of dna/protamine complex became paste by kneading the complex powder and distilled water. complex formation was confirmed by ft-ir measurement. the complex paste had a porous structure and its viscosity was approximately 280.1 pas. the paste could easily pass through a needle of 0.25 mm internal diameter. it seemed that dna/protamine complex paste has suitable viscosity for clinical use as an injectable biomaterial. although, the complex paste delayed the growth speed of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia for limited periods, it cannot kill and inhibit growing bacteria. the complex paste disk showed a mild tissue response and gradually degraded after the implantation into the soft tissue of rats. these results suggested that this dna/protamine complex paste could be a useful material for a biodegradable biomaterial. in particular, this paste will be applicable as an injectable biomaterial using syringe for the repair of defects of living tissue, gbr treatment and/or gtr treatment in dentistry.
inhibition of growth of highly resistant bacterial and fungal pathogens by a natural product.
the continuous escalation of resistant bacteria against a wide range of antibiotics necessitates discovering novel unconventional sources of antibiotics. b. oleracea l (red cabbage) is health-promoting food with proven anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. however, it has not been researched adequately for its antimicrobial activity on potential resistant pathogens. the methanol crude extract of b. oleracea l. was investigated for a possible anti-microbial activity. the screening method was conducted using disc diffusion assay against 22 pathogenic bacteria and fungi. it was followed by evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). moreover, the antibacterial and the antifungal activities were confirmed using the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (mfc), respectively. remarkable, antibacterial activity was evident particularly against highly infectious microorganisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium as well as against human fungal pathogens, trichophyton rubrum and aspergillus terreus. red cabbage is a rich source of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins being the most abundant class, which might explain its potent antimicrobial action. this extract is potentially novel for future antimicrobials, inexpensive, and readily available at a large scale for pharmaceutical companies for further investigation and processing.
antibacterial activity and phytochemical study of six medicinal plants used in benin.
the ethanol extracts obtained from psidium guajava, flacourtia flavescens boswellia dalzielii, ficus exasperata, pavetta corymbosa and hybanthus enneaspermus, six species traditionally used in benin to treat several infectious diseases, were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, enteroccocus feacalis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimum inhibitory concentration of extracts was determinate using the microplate dilution method. the presence of major phytoconstituents was detected qualitatively. the diphenylpicrylhydrazine radical scavenging activity was also performed. the extracts exhibited antibacterial activities against the tested bacteria. boswellia dalzielii, psidium guayava, pavetta corymbosa and flacourtia flavescens exibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration values (0.313-2.5 mg ml(-1)). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lest sensitive microorganism with mic values higher than 10 mg ml(-1). in antioxidant assay the crude extracts of b. dalzielii and p. corymbosa appeared to be as potent as quercetol with an inhibition percentage of 83 and 75.3% at 10 microg ml(-1) which is comparable to 75.9% for quercetol at the same concentration.
synthesis and biological evaluation of dihydroindeno and indeno [1,2-e] [1,2,4]triazolo [3,4-b] [1,3,4]thiadiazines as antimicrobial agents.
two series of compounds namely, dihydroindeno and indeno [1,2-e] [1,2,4]triazolo  [3,4-b] [1,3,4]thiadizines (9a-l & 11a-l) were synthesized by cyclocondensation between alpha-bromoindanones (7a-b) or/and alpha,alpha-dibromoindanones (8a-b) and various 3-alkyl/aryl-4-amino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-s-triazoles (3a-f) in methanol with an aim to explore their effect on in vitro growth of microorganism causing microbial infection. in vitro antibacterial activity was performed against four strains namely, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against three fungal strains namely, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus, penicillium species. of all the compounds screened for activity some of the compounds were associated with considerably higher antibacterial and antifungal activity than commercial antibiotics.
anti-biofilm and anti-adherence activity of glm-u inhibitors.
background: intravascular catheters and urinary catheters are an important source of hospital-acquired infections. many microorganisms colonize indwelling catheters, including central venous catheters (cvcs) forming biofilms and cause infections that are difficult to treat. although various methods have been employed to reduce biofilms, enzymes involved in bacterial cell wall synthesis could provide novel targets for the development of anti-biofilm agents. n-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (glmu) is an essential enzyme in aminosugars metabolism and catalyzes the formation of uridine-diphospho-n-acetylglucosamine (udp-glcnac), an important precursor in the peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. previous study has been conducted on the anti-biofilm effect of glmu inhibitors such as n-ethyl maleimide (nem) and nem analogs along with a cationic polypeptide protamine sulfate (ps), which enhanced its anti-biofilm activity. aim: the present study aimed at finding the effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations of n-ethyl maleimide (nem) and protamine sulfate (ps) on the biofilms produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus spp. isolated from cases of catheter-associated uti as well as klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus isolated from cases of catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsi). materials and methods: in order to enhance the activity of nem and to develop a broad-spectrum anti-microbial composition, nem (50 mug/ml) was combined with protamine sulfate (50 mug/ml) and tested for anti-biofilm activity using a standard quantitative biofilm assay method. results and conclusion: it was observed that nem had no effect on the biofilm produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as by enterococcus spp. nem also caused a significant decrease in biofilm production by staphylococcus aureus while it had no effect on the biofilm produced by klebsiella pneumoniae. there was a significant synergistic inhibitory effect on staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp., whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae remained unaffected. combination of glmu inhibitor-plus-protamine sulfate failed to significantly reduce bacterial adherence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae to catheter and cannula pieces, respectively. we found that the glmu inhibitor was mainly effective in preventing the adherence and biofilm formation by gram-positive organisms. the combination of nem and protamine sulfate may, therefore, be tried as anti-infective coatings for medical devices such as catheters and cannulas, and thus help in overcoming microbial resistance in the current era of increasing device-associated hospital infections.
evaluation of abelmoschus moschatus extracts for antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities using in vitro assays.
background: abelmoschus moschatus medik. leaves and seeds are considered as valuable traditional medicine. the aromatic seeds of this plant are aphrodisiac, ophthalmic, cardio tonic, antispasmodic and used in the treatment of intestinal complaints and check queasiness. to give a scientific basis for traditional usage of this medicinal plant, the seed and leaf extracts were evaluated for their antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. methods: in this study, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities of a. moschatus extracts were evaluated in a series of in vitro assay involving free radicals, reactive oxygen species and their ic50 values were also determined. the antioxidant activities of the seed and leaf extracts of a. moschatus were determined by total antioxidant, dpph, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (frap) methods. in addition, the antiproliferative activity was also evaluated using colorectal adenocarcinoma and retinoblastoma human cancer cell lines. moreover, six bacterial reference strains, two gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus), four gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and salmonella enterica paratyphi) and one fungal strain (candida albicans) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial activity. results: the results from this study showed that the antioxidant activities of a. moschatus as determined by the total phenol, flavonoids, total antioxidant and frap methods were higher in leaf than that of the seed extracts. on the other hand, the aqueous overnight seed extract (ams-i) has shown significant radical scavenging activity as in 1, 1- diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph), hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, superoxide and lipid peroxidation as compared to other seed and leaf extracts. the ams-i and aml-iv have shown activity against six and seven microorganisms respectively. simulteneously, ams-iv and aml-iv have demonstrated potential antiproliferative activity against two human cell lines - colorectal adenocarcinoma (colo-205) and retinoblastoma (y79). conclusion: the seed and leaf extracts of a. moschatus possess significant antioxidant activity and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavenger, or substitute, probably as primary antioxidants. the plant possesses moderate antibacterial activity against bacterial strains used in this study. hydroalcoholic seed and leaf extracts also exhibited antiproliferative activity against two human cancer cell lines. a. moschatus may therefore, be a good candidate for functional foods as well as pharmaceutics.
chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of lantana camara var. moritziana.
the essential oil obtained from the leaves of lantana camara var. moritziana (otto & dietr.) lopez-palacios collected at rubio, tachira state, venezuela, was obtained by hydrodistillation in a clevenger trap (0.1% yield). the oil was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc/ms) on hp gc-ms system, model 5973, identifying 33 compounds (97.1%) of which the major components were germacrene d (31.0%), followed by beta-caryophyllene (14.8%), a-phellandrene (6.7%), limonene (5.7%) and 1,8-cineole (5.2%). evaluation of the antibacterial activity by agar diffusion method with discs against international reference bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa) showed growing inhibition of e. faecalis and s. aureus at mic of 350 mg/ml and 400 mg/ml, respectively.
appropriate antibiotic dosage levels in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock.
antibiotic treatment of critically ill patients remains a significant challenge.  optimal antibacterial strategy should achieve therapeutic drug concentration in the blood as well as the infected site. achieving therapeutic drug concentrations is particularly difficult when infections are caused by some pathogens, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative rods, because of their low susceptibility to antimicrobials. in sepsis, pharmacokinetics (pks) of antibiotics are profoundly altered and may result in inadequate drug concentrations, even when recommended regimens are used, which potentially contribute to increased mortality and spread of resistance. the wide inter-individual pk variability observed in septic patients strongly limits the a priori prediction of the optimal dose that should be administered. higher than standard dosages are necessary for the drugs, such as beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and glycopeptides, that are commonly used as first-line therapy in these patients to maximize their antibacterial activity. however, the benefit of reaching adequate drug concentrations on clinical outcome needs to be further determined.
anti-microbial principles of selected remedial plants from southern india.
objective: to examine the anti-bacterial activity of leaf extracts of morus alba  l. (moraceae) and piper betel l. (piperaceae), and seed extracts of bombax ceiba l. (borabacaceae). methods: we have partially purified plant extracts by solvent extraction method, and evaluated the effect of individual fractions on bacterial growth using escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) bacterial strains. results: compared with morus and bombax fractions, piper fractions showed significant growth inhibition on all the three types of bacteria studied. the etoac-hexane fractions of piper leaves exhibited significant anti-bacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 50 microg/ml culture against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the etoac-fractions i, ii, and iv inhibited bacterial colony formation on soft agar in addition to growth inhibition. a combination treatment of piper fractions with ampicillin resulted in significant growth inhibition in e. coli and p. aeruginosa, and combination with anticancer drug geldanamycin (2microg/ml) showed selective growth inhibition against p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. three major compounds, i.e., eugenol, 3-hexene-ol and stigmasterol, were primarily identified from piper betel leaf extractions. among the individual compounds, eugenol treatment showed improved growth inhibition compared with stigmasterol and 3-hexene-ol. conclusions: we are reporting potential anti-bacterial compounds from piper betel against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria either alone or in combination with drug treatment.
rising bacterial resistance to common antibiotics in al ain, united arab emirates.
there is a dearth of local information in al amin, united arab emirates about antibiotic resistance patterns. in this retrospective study in a tertiary referral hospital, antibiotic susceptibility results were analysed over the 5-year period 2004-08 and compared with a previous study in the same hospital during 1999-2002. staphylococcus aureus showed a significant decrease in sensitivity to oxacillin from 95.0% in the period 1999-2002 to 84.4% in 2008. sensitivity of acinetobacter spp. to imipenem dropped from 99.0% in 2004 to only 32.5% in 2008. during the same period, almost half of escherichia coli isolates developed resistance to cefotoxime. significant reductions in sensitivity to pseudomonas aeruginosa between 1999 and 2008 were found for almost all the antibiotics tested. klebsiella spp. did not show any significant change in resistance to any of the tested antibiotics. serious efforts are needed to reduce the risk of the spread of resistant strains of bacteria.
[antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
isolation and identification of bioactive antibacterial components in leaf extracts of vangueria spinosa (rubiaceae).
objective: the column chromatographic fraction of ethyl acetate (ea1, ea2, ea3, ea4 and ea5) leaf extracts of vangueria spinosa (v. spinosa) were screened for antibacterial activity and phytochemical analysis. methods: ea3 fraction was isolated and identified by column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, spectral data analysis and phytochemical screening were used for analysis. results: ea3 fraction was significantly active at 4 to 64 mg/l against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa with minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.5625 to 3.1250 mg/ml. the active fraction (ea3) revealed the presence of flavonoid with retention factor value (r(f)) of 0.39. the active antibacterial agent in the most potent fraction (ea3) was isolated and identified as flavonoid (-)-epicatechin-3-o-beta-glucopyranoside by thin layer chromatography (tlc) and phytochemical screening. ea1 and ea2 show inhibitory activity at 4 to 64 mg/l against staphylococcus aureus only where as fraction ea4 and ea5 do not shows any inhibitory activity within that range of concentration against any bacteria. conclusions: the results support the ethnomedicinal use of leaf of v. spinosa for the treatment of bacterial diseases.
the influence of silver content on the tribological and antimicrobial properties  of zrn/ag nanocomposite coatings.
zrn/ag nanocomposite coatings with varying silver contents were produced by co-deposition in a dual pulsed magnetron sputtering system. the coatings were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (sem), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (edx), x-ray diffraction (xrd), scratch adhesion testing, thrust washer wear testing and nanoindentation. the hardness of the zrn/ag coatings and the friction coefficient running unlubricated against a steel counterface decreased with increasing silver content, whereas the coating-to-substrate adhesion increased for coatings with higher silver contents, compared to a 'pure' zrn coating. the antimicrobial properties of the coatings were investigated using two well established microbiological assay techniques: zones of inhibition and a nbt (nitro-blue tetrazolium) redox dye. zones of inhibition were used to determine the extent of silver ion release from the nanocomposite materials, and a nbt (nitro-blue tetrazolium) redox dye was used to determine the antimicrobial effectiveness of the surfaces following incubation. the microorganisms tested were pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), escherichia coli (e. coli) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus). whilst no zones of inhibition were observed for s. aureus, on any of the surfaces, the diameter of the 'kill' zones generally increased with increasing silver content for the other microorganisms. for the nbt assays, after incubation, no p. aeruginosa colony forming units were observed on any surface and the number of viable cells of e. coli and s. aureus decreased with increasing silver content, compared to a 'pure' zrn surface.
effectiveness of bacterial disinfectants on surfaces of mechanical ventilator systems.
background: pathogens in healthcare settings can be transmitted via skin contact  and environmental media. this study investigates bacterial contamination rate on surfaces of mechanical ventilator systems and bedside equipment. an experimental study evaluates the effectiveness of 75% alcohol in killing bacteria on surfaces. methods: surface swab sampling was conducted on ventilator systems and patient bedside equipment for detection of bacterial contamination. surfaces of ventilator systems, such as faceplates, y-pieces, and water traps, were swab sampled at 0.5, 8, and 24 hours after initial disinfection using a solution containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite and pasteurization. the 75% alcohol aerosol was sprayed on the surfaces of faceplates, y-pieces, and water traps on ventilator systems at 24 hours after initial disinfection, and then bacterial levels on the surfaces were evaluated. results: detection rates of staphylococcus aureus were measured on the handrails of mechanical ventilators (64.7%), y-pieces of breathing circuits (86.7%), and resuscitators (60.0%). pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified on the surfaces of y-pieces (6.7%) and water traps (13.3%) of breathing circuits, and also on suction systems (6.7%) and resuscitators (13.3%). the positive rate for total bacterial count was clearly increased on the surfaces of faceplates, y-pieces, and water traps at 8 hour following disinfection by 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution and pasteurization. concentrations of s. aureus on surfaces decreased following treatment with 75% alcohol. however, considerable p. aeruginosa growth on water trap surfaces was observed after treatment with 75% alcohol. conclusions: the surfaces of ventilator systems, including faceplates, y-pieces, and water traps, must be disinfected frequently (at least every 8 h) to control bacterial growth. disinfection using 75% alcohol spray with air drying effectively decreased s. aureus on ventilator system surfaces.
bacteria-specific neutrophil dysfunction associated with interferon-stimulated gene expression in the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) is a poorly understood condition with  greater than 30% mortality. massive recruitment of neutrophils to the lung occurs in the initial stages of the ards. significant variability in the severity and duration of ards-associated pulmonary inflammation could be linked to heterogeneity in the inflammatory capacity of neutrophils. interferon-stimulated genes (isgs) are a broad gene family induced by type i interferons. while isgs are central to anti-viral immunity, the potential exists for these genes to evoke extensive modification in cellular response in other clinical settings. in this prospective study, we sought to determine if isg expression in circulating neutrophils from ards patients is associated with changes in neutrophil function. circulating neutrophil rna was isolated, and hierarchical clustering ranked patients' expression of three isgs. neutrophil response to pathogenic bacteria was compared between normal and high isg-expressing neutrophils. high neutrophil isg expression was found in 25 of 95 (26%) of ards patients and was associated with reduced migration toward interleukin-8, and altered responses to staphylococcus aureus, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa, which included decreased p38 map kinase phosphorylation, superoxide anion release, interleukin-8 release, and a shift from necrotic to apoptotic cell death. these alterations in response were reflected in a decreased capacity to kill s. aureus, but not p. aeruginosa. therefore, the isg expression signature is associated with an altered circulating neutrophil response phenotype in ards that may predispose a large subgroup of patients to increased risk of specific bacterial infections.
incorporation of probiotic bacteria in whey cheese: decreasing the risk of microbial contamination.
for dairy products that are consumed fresh, contamination by spoilage microorganisms and pathogens from the environment is a major concern. contamination has been associated with a number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses; however, consistent data pertaining to the microbial safety of whey cheeses specifically have not been reported. hence, the goals of this research effort were (i) to manufacture a probiotic whey cheese with bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus casei and (ii) to assess the antimicrobial activity of these probiotics against a set of foodborne pathogens (listeria innocua, salmonella enteritidis, and staphylococcus aureus) and food spoilage microorganisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). three ranges of these microbial contaminants were used for inoculation of cheeses: 10(3) to 10(4), 10(4) to 10(6), and 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/g. inoculation in plain culture medium served as a control. the inhibition produced by the probiotics was calculated, and the major effect was found to be bacteriostatic. in specific cases, full inhibition was observed, i.e., by b. animalis against p. aeruginosa and by l. casei against salmonella enteritidis and l. innocua. conversely, the least inhibition was detected for l. casei against p. aeruginosa. our results suggest that use of these probiotic strains can extend the shelf life of whey cheeses and make them safer by delaying or preventing growth of common contaminant bacteria.
a new class of 2-(4-cyanophenyl amino)-4-(6-bromo-4-quinolinyloxy)-6-piperazinyl  (piperidinyl)-1,3,5-triazine analogues with antimicrobial/antimycobacterial activity.
this study presents the synthesis and in vitro pharmacological evaluations of novel 2-(4-cyanophenyl amino)-4-(6-bromo-4-quinolinyloxy)-6-piperazinyl (piperidinyl)-1,3,5-triazines. the title compounds were assayed for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against eight bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus vulgaris, shigella flexneria) and four fungi (aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus clavatus, candida albicans) using paper disc diffusion and agar streak dilution method as well as against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv strain using bactec mgit and lowenstein-jensen mic method. the bioassay results indicate that nine compounds namely 5d, 5h, 5n, 5p, 5q, 5r, 5s, 5t and 5u could be considered as possible potential agents with dual antimicrobial and antimycobacterial activities. the structures of the compounds were elucidated with the aid of ir, (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr, (19)f nmr spectroscopy and chn analysis.
candida albicans infection of caenorhabditis elegans induces antifungal immune defenses.
candida albicans yeast cells are found in the intestine of most humans, yet this  opportunist can invade host tissues and cause life-threatening infections in susceptible individuals. to better understand the host factors that underlie susceptibility to candidiasis, we developed a new model to study antifungal innate immunity. we demonstrate that the yeast form of c. albicans establishes an intestinal infection in caenorhabditis elegans, whereas heat-killed yeast are avirulent. genome-wide, transcription-profiling analysis of c. elegans infected with c. albicans yeast showed that exposure to c. albicans stimulated a rapid host response involving 313 genes (124 upregulated and 189 downregulated, ~1.6% of the genome) many of which encode antimicrobial, secreted or detoxification proteins. interestingly, the host genes affected by c. albicans exposure overlapped only to a small extent with the distinct transcriptional responses to the pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus, indicating that there is a high degree of immune specificity toward different bacterial species and c. albicans. furthermore, genes induced by p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were strongly over-represented among the genes downregulated during c. albicans infection, suggesting that in response to fungal pathogens, nematodes selectively repress the transcription of antibacterial immune effectors. a similar phenomenon is well known in the plant immune response, but has not been described previously in metazoans. finally, 56% of the genes induced by live c. albicans were also upregulated by heat-killed yeast. these data suggest that a large part of the transcriptional response to c. albicans is mediated through "pattern recognition," an ancient immune surveillance mechanism able to detect conserved microbial molecules (so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns or pamps). this study provides new information on the evolution and regulation of the innate immune response to divergent pathogens and demonstrates that nematodes selectively mount specific antifungal defenses at the expense of antibacterial responses.
anti-infective properties of lactobacillus fermentum against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
surgical wounds and implant-associated staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are often difficult to treat because of limited susceptibility of several of these strains to conventional antibiotics. as a result, there is a constant need for new alternative drugs. the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of lactobacillus fermentum, a probiotic bacterium, which we have isolated from colonic biopsies. the inhibition of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa growth was evaluated by coincubating with l. fermentum strains. growth inhibition was tested for several of their clinical isolates using agar well diffusion assays. for biofilm assay s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were grown on the glass slides and in 96-well plates in presence of 2.5 mug/ml culture filtrate of l. fermentum. biofilms were photographed using confocal microscope or stained with 0.1% crystal violet. reduction in the cytotoxicity of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa was observed in presence of 2.5 mug/ml l. fermentum-spent media. using in vitroexperiments, we showed that l. fermentum-secreted compound(s) inhibits the growth, cytotoxicity and biofilm formation of several s. aureus and p. aeruginosa strains. compound(s) present in the culture supernatant of l. fermentum may have promising applications in treating hospital-acquired infections.
monitoring antibiotic resistance in ocular microorganisms: results from the antibiotic resistance monitoring in ocular microrganisms (armor) 2009 surveillance study.
purpose: to determine the antibacterial susceptibility profile of bacterial pathogens from ocular infections against relevant aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolone, glycopeptide, lincosamide, and macrolide antibacterial agents. design: laboratory investigation. methods: isolates from patients with bacterial eye infections were collected prospectively by 34 institutions across the united states and were submitted to a central laboratory for inclusion in the antibiotic resistance monitoring in ocular microrganisms (armor) study. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by microbroth dilution for 200 staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), 144 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 75 streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), 73 haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae), and 100 pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) isolates. results: a large proportion of s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were resistant to oxacillin/methicillin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolones; 46.5% of s. aureus, 58.3% of coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.0% of p. aeruginosa, and 9.3% of pneumococcal isolates were nonsusceptible to 2 or more antibacterial drug classes. only 2.7% of h. influenzae isolates were nonsusceptible to 1 of the agents tested. methicillin-resistant staphylococci were statistically more likely (all p < .0038) also to be resistant to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. conclusions: resistance to 1 or more antibiotics is prevalent among ocular bacterial pathogens. current resistance trends should be considered before initiating empiric treatment of common eye infections.
two antimicrobial and nematicidal peptides derived from sequences encoded picea sitchensis.
two antimicrobial peptides (piceain 1 and 2) derived from sequences encoded picea sitchensis are identified. their amino acid sequences are kslrprcwikikfrckslkf and rprcwikikfrckslkf, respectively. one intra-molecular disulfide bridge is formed by these two half-cysteines in both piceain 1 and 2. antimicrobial activities of synthesized piceains against several kinds of microorganisms were tested. they showed antimicrobial activities against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and fungus candida albicans but little antimicrobial activity against bacillus subtilis. the results of nematicidal test showed they exerted strong nematicidal activities against caenorhabditis elegans, following exposure for 5 h at concentrations as low as 10 microg/ml. they had weak hemolytic abilities against human and rabbit red cells. at the concentration of 250 microg/ml, they induced red cell hemolysis of less than 5%. circular dichroism spectra of the two antimicrobial peptides were investigated in several solutions. their main secondary structure components are beta-sheet and random. the current work provides a novel family of antimicrobial and nematicidal peptides with unique disulfided loop containing nine amino acid residues.
synthesis, characterization and biological properties of thienyl derived triazole schiff bases and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes.
a new series of biologically active thienyl derived triazole schiff bases and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes have been synthesized and characterized on the basis of physical (m.p., magnetic susceptibility and conductivity), spectral (ir, (1)h and (1)(3)c nmr, electronic and mass spectrometry) and microanalytical data. all the schiff base ligands and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes have been subjected to in vitro antibacterial activity against four gram-negative (escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serover typhi) and two gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis) bacterial strains and, for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifucus, candida albican, aspergillus flavus, microscopum canis, fusarium solani and candida glabrata. brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to check the cytotoxic nature of these compounds.
new triterpenes from barringtonia asiatica.
the leaves of barringtonia asiatica afforded two new triterpenes, germanicol caffeoyl ester (1) and camelliagenone (2). their structures were elucidated by extensive 1d- and 2d-nmr spectroscopy. it also afforded germanicol trans-coumaroyl ester (3), germanicol cis-coumaroyl ester (4), germanicol (5), camelliagenin a (6), spinasterol, sitosterol, squalene, lutein and trilinolein. compounds 3, spinasterol and trilinolein were isolated from the fruits, while the seeds yielded spinasterol, squalene, linoleic acid and trilinolein. compounds 1-5 exhibited antifungal activity against candida albicans, 1-3 and 5 showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, while 5 is active against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
in vitro assay of the antimicrobial activity of kephir against bacterial and fungal strains.
kephir is a fermented carbonated refreshing milk, with a slightly acidic aromatic taste and creamy foam composition which contains lactobacilli, leuconostocci, acetic acid bacteria, lactostreptococci and yeasts. recent studies have demonstrated its antibacterial, immunostimulating, antitumoral and cholesterol-lowering activities. purpose: the purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of kephir against bacillus subtilis spp. spizizenii atcc 6633, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, escherichia coli atcc 8739, salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 9027 and candida albicans atcc 10231. the kephir fermented for 24 h and 48 h, as well and after 7 days preservation at 4-8 degrees c was tested by in vitro disk diffusion method. the intensity of the antimicrobial activity was interpreted by comparison with two antibiotics, i.e. ampicillin and neomycin. results: the antimicrobial activity of 24 h as well as 48 fermented kephir, fresh or after 7 days preservation at 4-8 degrees c was similar and observed against b. subtilis, s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecalis and s. enteritidis. for e. coli, e. faecalis and s. enteritidis the antimicrobial activity was superior to both tested antibiotics and for b. subtilis and s. aureus to one antibiotic. the tested products exhibited no activity against p. aeruginosa and c. albicans. conclusion: kephir is exhibiting large spectrum and strong antibacterial activity probably due to the complex viable probiotic strains association producing antimicrobial substances.
phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of labisa pumila benth.
a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
interaction of n-methyl-2-alkenyl-4-quinolones with atp-dependent mure ligase of  mycobacterium tuberculosis: antibacterial activity, molecular docking and inhibition kinetics.
objectives: the aim of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the antibacterial activity and mure inhibition of a set of n-methyl-2-alkenyl-4-quinolones found to inhibit the growth of fast-growing mycobacteria. methods: using the spot culture growth inhibition assay, mics were determined for mycobacterium tuberculosis h(37)rv, mycobacterium bovis bcg and mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155. mics were determined for mycobacterium fortuitum, mycobacterium phlei, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa using microplate dilution assays. inhibition of m. tuberculosis mure ligase activity was determined both by colorimetric and hplc methods. computational modelling and binding prediction of the quinolones in the mure structure was performed using glide. kinetic experiments were conducted for understanding possible competitive relations of the quinolones with the endogenous substrates of mure ligase. results: the novel synthetic n-methyl-2-alkenyl-4-quinolones were found to be growth inhibitors of m. tuberculosis and rapid-growing mycobacteria as well as methicillin-resistant s. aureus, while showing no inhibition for e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the quinolones were found to be inhibitory to mure ligase of m. tuberculosis in the micromolar range (ic(50) approximately 40-200 mum) when assayed either spectroscopically or by hplc. computational docking of the quinolones on the published m. tuberculosis mure crystal structure suggested that the uracil recognition site is a probable binding site for the quinolones. conclusions: n-methyl-2-alkenyl-4-quinolones are inhibitors of mycobacterial and staphylococcal growth, and show mure ligase inhibition. therefore, they are considered as a starting point for the development of increased affinity mure activity disruptors.
antimicrobial activities of the methanol extract and compounds from artocarpus communis (moraceae).
background: artocarpus communis is used traditionally in cameroon to treat several ailments, including infectious and associated diseases. this work was therefore designed to investigate the antimicrobial activities of the methanol extract (acb) and compounds isolated from the bark of this plant, namely peruvianursenyl acetate c (1), alpha-amyrenol or viminalol (2), artonin e (4) and 2-[(3,5-dihydroxy)-(z)-4-(3-methylbut-1-enyl)phenyl]benzofuran-6-ol (5). methods: the liquid microdilution assay was used in the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimal microbicidal concentration (mmc), against seven bacterial and one fungal species. results: the mic results indicated that acb as well as compounds 4 and 5 were able to prevent the growth of all tested microbial species. all other compounds showed selective activities. the lowest mic value of 64 mug/ml for the crude extract was recorded on staphylococcus aureus atcc 25922 and escherichia coli atcc 8739. the corresponding value of 32 mug/ml was recorded with compounds 4 and 5 on pseudomonas aeruginosa pa01 and compound 5 on e. coli atcc 8739, their inhibition effect on p. aeruginosa pa01 being more than that of chloramphenicol used as reference antibiotic. conclusion: the overall results of this study provided supportive data for the use of a. communis as well as some of its constituents for the treatment of infections associated with the studied microorganisms.
cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity of pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins  isolated from the octocoral pseudopterogorgia elisabethae of san andres and providencia islands (southwest caribbean sea).
to expand the potential of pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins isolated from the octocoral pseudopterogorgia elisabethae of san andres and providencia islands (southwest caribbean sea), we report the anti-microbial profile against four pathogenic microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans) and report a more complete cytotoxic profile against five human cells lines (hela, pc-3, hct116, mcf-7 and bj) for the compounds psg, psp, psq, pss, pst, psu, 3-o-acetyl-psu, seco-psj, seco-psk and imngd. for the cytotoxic profiles, all compounds evaluated showed moderate and non-selective activity against both tumor and normal cell lines, where psq and psg were the most active compounds (gi(5)(0) values between 5.8 mum to 12.0 mum). with respect to their anti-microbial activity the compounds showed good and selective activity against the gram-positive bacteria, while they did not show activity against the gram-negative bacterium or yeast. psu, psq, pss, seco-psk and psg were the most active compounds (ic(5)(0) 2.9-4.5 mum) against s. aureus and psg, psu and seco-psk showed good activity (ic(5)(0) 3.1-3.8 mum) against e. faecalis, comparable to the reference drug vancomycin (4.2 mum).
lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
effect of active packaging incorporated with triclosan on bacteria adhesion.
antimicrobial polyethylene and cellulose based films incorporated with triclosan  were studied. the antimicrobial efficacy, the hydrophobicity, microscopic and the mechanical characteristics of the films, as well free energy of adhesion between bacteria and antimicrobial films were evaluated. it was observed that both polyethylene and cellulose based films incorporated with the antimicrobial were homogeneous. furthermore, the addition of triclosan did not affect mechanical characteristics of the films (p > 0.05). however, triclosan incorporated into polyethylene films reduced its hydrophobicity while antimicrobial cellulose based films became more hydrophobic. the adhesion was thermodynamically favorable between tested bacteria and polyethylene films. on the other hand, the adhesion to triclosan cellulose based film was thermodynamically unfavorable to staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli and favorable to listeria innocua and pseudomonas aeruginosa. polyethylene and cellulose based films showed inhibitory effect against s. aureus and e. coli, being the inhibition halo higher for polyethylene films. this study improves the knowledge about antimicrobial films.
microbial isolation and emergence of antimicrobial resistance associated with tigecycline usage.
background: with the increasing experience of tigecycline usage, its ecological impact on microorganisms raises concerns but remains unknown. we aimed to analyze the difference in microorganisms isolated before, during, and after tigecycline usage and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. methods: between july 2008 and august 2009, 66 patients who received tigecycline monotherapy for more than 2 days at a taiwan medical center were enrolled. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method with vitek-2 system and was analyzed according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines, except for tigecycline. we followed usa food and drug administration criteria for interpretation of susceptibility to tigecycline. results: the median duration of tigecycline monotherapy was 13.4 days. after tigecycline treatment, the isolation frequency of acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased, but that of pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia did not change. a baumannii and p aeruginosa were the two most common pathogens when tigecycline was administered. the tigecycline susceptibility rate of a baumannii isolates decreased after the administration of tigecycline. conclusion: the most common pathogens isolated in patients receiving tigecycline were a baumannii and p aeruginosa. tigecycline usage decreased the isolation frequency of a baumannii, methicillin-resistant s aureus, e coli, and k pneumoniae. exposure to tigecycline may be associated with a decreased susceptibility rate of a baumannii for tigecycline.
pathogen yield and antimicrobial resistance patterns of chronic rhinosinusitis patients presenting to a tertiary rhinology centre.
objectives: to examine the yield and resistance profile of pathogens in chronic rhinosinusitis (crs) patients receiving culture-directed management and to pay particular attention to the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in this population. study design: retrospective review of a crs microbiology database. participants: consecutive crs patients seen at the st. paul's sinus centre between june 2007 and august 2008. setting: canadian tertiary sinus centre. main outcome measure: to determine the pathogens isolated, the frequency of these pathogens, and their resistance profiles. results: the most common bacterial pathogens isolated were staphylococcus aureus, accounting for 39% of cultured samples, followed by haemophilus influenzae (29%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and moraxella catarrhalis (11%). only three cases of mrsa were found, one in a patient with cystic fibrosis. conclusion: mrsa does not appear to pose a significant risk of morbidity in our patient population. however, ongoing concern regarding the increasing prevalence of s. aureus and antimicrobial resistance in chronic sinonasal disease highlights the importance of using culture-directed antimicrobial therapy with the goal of minimizing future resistance patterns.
use of flow cytometry to compare the antimicrobial efficacy of silver-containing  wound dressings against planktonic staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
silver-impregnated wound dressings continue to be routinely used for the management of infected wounds, or wounds that are at risk of becoming infected. the ability of antimicrobials that have been incorporated into wound dressings to kill microorganisms within the dressing requires appropriate evaluation using in vitro models. in vitro models that have been exploited for this purpose have included the corrected zone of inhibition and the log reduction assay. however, these and other related culturable-based assays are purported to have poor correlation with the overall microbicidal barrier activity of an antimicrobial wound dressing. this is because culturable-based methods only retrospectively indicate bacterial cell death and do not take into account viable but nonculturable states of microorganisms. consequently, it was the purpose of this study to show that the use of flow cytometry, in conjunction with syto((r)) 9 and propidium iodide, could be used as a method for accurately evaluating and comparing the antimicrobial barrier efficacy of a silver alginate and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose dressing on individual bacterial cells without the need for the use of culturable assays. when a comparison of antimicrobial barrier efficacy on individual planktonic staphylococcus aureus cells in a simulated wound fluid assay was made between each dressing, enhanced antimicrobial efficacy (as showed by the percentage of dead to alive bacterial cells) of the silver alginate dressing was shown. when pseudomonas aeruginosa was exposed to both silver-containing dressings, equivalent kill rates were showed for up to 4 days. this result was not significantly different (p<0.05). by utilizing the use of flow cytometric assays, the antimicrobial barrier efficacy of wound dressings can be accurately evaluated enabling differentiation to be achieved between individual dead and live bacteria. the flow cytometric assay is considered a significant advancement to the traditionally used culturable-based methods that are presently used for antimicrobial barrier efficacy testing on planktonic microorganisms.
the antibacterial activity of bf-30 in vitro and in infected burned rats is through interference with cytoplasmic membrane integrity.
cathelicidin-bf (bf-30) is found in the venom of the snake bungarus fasciatus and exhibits broad antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. nevertheless, its antibacterial activity in vivo and antibacterial mechanism is unknown. in the present study, we examined the antibacterial activity of bf-30 in vitro against drug-resistant escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, first identifying its protection against p. aeruginosa in infected burns and then delineating the antimicrobial mechanism of bf-30. the data showed that bf-30 had stronger antimicrobial activities against a broad spectrum of microorganisms than gentamicin, ampicillin or bacitracin. the killing curves of bf-30 against p. aeruginosa and s. aureus showed that cfu counts rapidly decreased by almost 2 logs within 6min, and it took just less than 2h to kill all the bacteria. in addition, we investigated whether bf-30 had antibacterial activity in a burn/acute infection rat model. dose-response (0.75, 3, 12mg/kg/day) studies indicated that bf-30 significantly reduced the colonization of p. aeruginosa in the burn eschars, lungs and liver of burn injured rats and that it could prevent subsequent systemic infection and development of inflammation. the peptide induced chaotic membrane morphology and cell debris, as determined by electron microscopy, and caused the cytoplasmic membrane to crack, resulting in beta-galactosidase leakage and etbr accumulation. this suggests that the antimicrobial activity of bf-30 is based on cytoplasmic membrane permeability. taken together, our data demonstrate that antibacterial activity of bf-30 has potential therapeutic value for the prevention and treatment of burn and wound infections.
larvicidal, antimicrobial and brine shrimp activities of extracts from cissampelos mucronata and tephrosia villosa from coast region, tanzania.
background: the leaves and roots of cissampelos mucronata a. rich (menispermaceae) are widely used in the tropics and subtropics to manage various ailments such as gastro-intestinal complaints, menstrual problems, venereal diseases and malaria. in the coast region, tanzania, roots are used to treat wounds due to extraction of jigger. leaves of tephrosia villosa (l) pers (leguminosae) are reported to be used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in india. in this study, extracts from the roots and aerial parts of c. mucronata and extracts from leaves, fruits, twigs and roots of t. villosa were evaluated for larvicidal activity, brine shrimps toxicity and antimicrobial activity. methods: powdered materials from c. mucronata were extracted sequentially by dichloromethane followed by ethanol while materials from t.villosa were extracted by ethanol only. the extracts obtained were evaluated for larvicidal activity using culex quinquefasciatus say larvae, cytotoxicity using brine shrimp larvae and antimicrobial activity using bacteria and fungi. results: extracts from aerial parts of c. mucronata exhibited antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, vibrio cholera, bacillus anthracis, streptococcus faecalis and antifungal activity against candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans. they exhibited very low toxicity to brine shrimps and had no larvicidal activity. the root extracts exhibited good larvicidal activity but weak antimicrobial activity. the root dichloromethane extracts from c. mucronata was found to be more toxic with an lc50 value of 59.608 mug/ml while ethanolic extracts from root were not toxic with lc50>100 mug/ml). ethanol extracts from fruits and roots of t. villosa were found to be very toxic with lc50 values of 9.690 mug/ml and 4.511 mug/ml, respectively, while, ethanol extracts from leaves and twigs of t. villosa were found to be non toxic (lc50>100 mug/ml). conclusion: these results support the use of c. mucronata in traditional medicine for treatment of wounds. extracts of c. mucronata have potential to yield active antimicrobial and larvicidal compounds. the high brine shrimp toxicity of t. villosa corroborates with literature reports that the plant is toxic to both livestock and fish. the results further suggest that t. villosa extracts have potential to yield larvicidal and possibly cytotoxic compounds. further studies to investigate the bioactive compounds responsible for the observed biological effects are suggested.
synergistic combination of chitosan acetate with nanoparticle silver as a topical antimicrobial: efficacy against bacterial burn infections.
chitosan and nanoparticle silver are both materials with demonstrated antimicrobial properties and have been proposed singly or in combination as constituents of antimicrobial burn dressings. here, we show that they combine synergistically to inhibit the in vitro growth of gram-positive methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter baumannii), as judged by bioluminescence monitoring and isobolographic analysis, and also produce synergistic killing after 30 min of incubation, as measured by a cfu assay. the hypothesized explanation involves chitosan-mediated permeabilization of bacterial cells, allowing better penetration of silver ions into the cell. a dressing composed of freeze-dried chitosan acetate incorporating nanoparticle silver was compared with a dressing of chitosan acetate alone in an in vivo burn model infected with bioluminescent p. aeruginosa. the survival rates of mice treated with silver-chitosan or regular chitosan or left untreated were 64.3% (p = 0.0082 versus regular chitosan and p = 0.0003 versus the control), 21.4%, and 0%, respectively. most of the fatalities occurred between 2 and 5 days postinfection. silver-chitosan dressings effectively controlled the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. these data suggest that a dressing combining chitosan acetate with silver leads to improved antimicrobial efficacy against fatal burn infections.
antibacterial activity in spices and local medicinal plants against clinical isolates of karachi, pakistan.
context: development of resistance in human pathogens against conventional antibiotic necessitates searching indigenous medicinal plants having antibacterial property. twenty-seven medicinal plants used actively in folklore, ayurvedic and traditional system of medicine were selected for the evaluation of their antimicrobial activity for this study. eleven plants chosen from these 27 are used as spices in local cuisine. objective: evaluation of the effectiveness of some medicinal plant extracts against clinical isolates. material and methods: nonedible plant parts were extracted with methanol and evaporated in vacuo to obtain residue. powdered edible parts were boiled three times and cooled in sterile distilled water for 2 min each and filtrate collected. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of plant extracts and filtrates/antibiotics was evaluated against clinical isolates by microbroth dilution method. results: water extract of syzygium aromaticum l. (myrtaceae) buds, methanol extracts of ficus carica l. (moraceae) and olea europaea l. (oleaceae) leaves and peganum harmala l. (nitrariaceae) seeds had mic ranges of 31.25-250 microg/ml. s. aromaticum inhibited growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa. f. carica and o. europaea inhibited growth of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. pyogenes whereas p. harmala was effective against s. aureus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and candida albicans. ampicillin, velosef, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, which are used as control, had mic >/= 50 and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively, for organisms sensitive to extracts. discussion and conclusion: mono/multiextract from identified plants will provide an array of safe antimicrobial agents to control infections by drug-resistant bacteria.
pathogen and autoantigen homologous regions within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) protein suggest an autoimmune treatable component of cystic fibrosis.
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) chloride channel provides the glutathione and hypochlorous acid necessary for bactericidal/viricidal actions. cftr mutations block these effects, diminishing pathogen defence and allowing extracellular pathogen accumulation, where antibody encounter is likely. kegg pathway analysis of the cftr interactome shows that cftr is involved in pathogen entry pathways and immune defence as well as in pathways relevant to comorbid conditions (diabetes, cardiomyopathies and sexual organ development). pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus infections decrease the lifespan of cystic fibrosis patients and stenotrophomonas maltophilia colonization is increased. autoantibodies, targeting myeloperoxidase, the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein and calgranulin may further compromise pathogen defence. short consensus sequences, within immunogenic extracellular regions of the cftr protein, are homologous to proteins expressed by p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and s. maltophilia, and to several autoantigens, with a universal overlap between autoantigen/pathogen/cftr consensi. antibodies to pathogens are thus likely responsible for the creation of these autoantibodies, which, with pathogen antibodies, may target the cftr protein acting as antagonists, further compromising its function. this creates a feedforward cycle, diminishing the function of the cftr protein and increasing the probability of pathogen accumulation and antibody production at every turn. interruption of this cycle by antibody adsorption or immunosuppressant therapy may be beneficial in cystic fibrosis.
[bacterial etiology of nosocomial pneumonia and antimicrobial resistance in patients with and without antimicrobial treatment].
nosocomial pneumonia (np) is associated with high morbimortality, representing the second cause of nosocomial infection after urinary tract infection. the objective of this work was to become acquainted with the etiology of np and to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance profile of the isolated microorganisms from adult patients with and without previous antimicrobial treatment admitted in the intensive care unit (icu). from 2000 to 2005, 430 bronchoalveolar lavages from 430 adult patients diagnosed with pneumonia admitted in the icu were analyzed. seventy-four percent (199/ 269) of the patients with previous treatment had positive cultures, whereas in the group without previous treatment the percentage was 83% (134/161) (p = 0,03). the main agents in both groups of patients were: acinetobacter spp. (37.9% vs 36.1%), staphylococcus aureus (21.3% vs 26.6% ) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.9% vs 17.7%), respectively (p > 0,05). the antimicrobial resistance in acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa and s. aureus from previously treated patients was higher than that from patients without previous antimicrobial treatment (p < 0,05), except in the case of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in s. aureus (p = 0,29). in conclusion, previous antimicrobial treatment did not modify the etiology of np, but caused an increase in overall antimicrobial resistance and a lower percentage of positive cultures.
antibiofilm activity of an exopolysaccharide from marine bacterium vibrio sp. qy101.
bacterial exopolysaccharides have always been suggested to play crucial roles in  the bacterial initial adhesion and the development of complex architecture in the later stages of bacterial biofilm formation. however, escherichia coli group ii capsular polysaccharide was characterized to exert broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition activity. in this study, we firstly reported that a bacterial exopolysaccharide (a101) not only inhibits biofilm formation of many bacteria but also disrupts established biofilm of some strains. a101 with an average molecular weight of up to 546 kda, was isolated and purified from the culture supernatant of the marine bacterium vibrio sp. qy101 by ethanol precipitation, iron-exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. high performance liquid chromatography traces of the hydrolyzed polysaccharides showed that a101 is primarily consisted of galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, rhamnose and glucosamine. a101 was demonstrated to inhibit biofilm formation by a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria without antibacterial activity. furthermore, a101 displayed a significant disruption on the established biofilm produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not by staphylococcus aureus. importantly, a101 increased the aminoglycosides antibiotics' capability of killing p. aeruginosa biofilm. cell primary attachment to surfaces and intercellular aggregates assays suggested that a101 inhibited cell aggregates of both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus, while the cell-surface interactions inhibition only occurred in s. aureus, and the pre-formed cell aggregates dispersion induced by a101 only occurred in p. aeruginosa. taken together, these data identify the antibiofilm activity of a101, which may make it potential in the design of new therapeutic strategies for bacterial biofilm-associated infections and limiting biofilm formation on medical indwelling devices. the found of a101 antibiofilm activity may also promote a new recognition about the functions of bacterial exopolysaccharides.
lactam nonanic acid, a new substance from cleome viscosa with allelopathic and antimicrobial properties.
cleome viscosa l. (capparidaceae) is well known for its medicinal properties. lactam nonanoic acid (lna) [2-amino-9-(4-oxoazetidin-2-yl)-nonanoic acid; c12h22n2o3, mol. wt. 242] has been isolated and purified from the root exudates of cleome viscosa. the aqueous solution of this pure compound has been tested on bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus) and fungi (aspergillus fumigatus, a. niger and a. tamarii). at a dosage of 500 ppm and above, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were totally inhibited while e. coli remained unaffected. on the other hand, growth of a. niger and a. tamarii was stimulated while there was no effect on a. fumigatus. this pure compound showed concentration-dependent inhibitory activity on rice, gram and mustard seeds.
the antimicrobial activity of inert oligonuclear polypyridylruthenium(ii) complexes against pathogenic bacteria, including mrsa.
the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of a series of synthetic inert polypyridylruthenium(ii) complexes against four strains of bacteria--gram positive staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and gram negative escherichia coli (e. coli) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa)--have been determined. the results demonstrate that for the dinuclear ruthenium(ii) complexes deltadelta/lambdalambda-[{ru(phen)(2)}(2){mu-bb(n)}](4+) {where phen = 1,10-phenanthroline; bb(n) = bis[4(4'-methyl-2,2'-bipyridyl)]-1,n-alkane (n = 2, 5, 7, 10, 12 or 16)} the complexes linked by the bb(12), bb(14) and bb(16) ligands are highly active, with mic values of 1 mug ml(-1) against both s. aureus and mrsa, and 2-4 and 8-16 mug ml(-1) against e. coli and p. aeruginosa, respectively. the mononuclear complex [ru(me(4)phen)(3)](2+) showed equal activity (on a mole basis) against s. aureus compared with the rubb(12), rubb(14) and rubb(16), but was considerably less active against mrsa and the two gram negative bacteria. for the dinuclear rubb(n) family of complexes, the antimicrobial activity was related to the octanol-water partition coefficient (logp). however, the highly lipophilic mononuclear complex delta-[ru(phen)(2)(bb(16))](2+) was significantly less active than rubb(16), highlighting the importance of the dinuclear structure. preliminary toxicity assays were also carried out for the deltadelta isomers of rubb(7), rubb(10), rubb(12) and rubb(16) against two human cells lines, fresh red blood cells and thp-1 cells. the results showed that the dinuclear ruthenium complexes are significantly less toxic to human cells compared to bacterial cells, with the hc(50) and ic(50) values 100-fold higher than the mic for the complex that showed the best potential--deltadelta-rubb(12).
paradigm shift in discovering next-generation anti-infective agents: targeting quorum sensing, c-di-gmp signaling and biofilm formation in bacteria with small molecules.
small molecules that can attenuate bacterial toxin production or biofilm formation have the potential to solve the bacteria resistance problem. although several molecules, which inhibit bacterial cell-to-cell communication (quorum sensing), biofilm formation and toxin production, have been discovered, there is a paucity of us fda-approved drugs that target these processes. here, we review the current understanding of quorum sensing in important pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus and provide examples of experimental molecules that can inhibit both known and unknown targets in bacterial virulence factor production and biofilm formation. structural data for protein targets that are involved in both quorum sensing and cyclic diguanylic acid signaling are needed to aid the development of molecules with drug-like properties in order to target bacterial virulence factors production and biofilm formation.

novel bis cyclohexenone ester derivatives 14-19 were synthesized and characterized by their spectral data. in vitro microbiological evaluations were carried out for all the novel compounds 14-19 against clinically isolated bacterial and fungal strains. compounds 15, 16, 18 against staphylococcus aureus, 14, 15 against beta-haemolytic streptococcus, 15, 19 against micrococcus luteus, 17, 18 against salmonella typhii, 14, 17 against shigella flexneri, 15 against escherichia coli, 16 against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15, 18, 19 against klebsiella pneumonia exhibited potent antibacterial activity at an minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 6.25 mug/ml, whereas compound 16 against aspergillus flavus, 17 against a. niger, 16, 18 against mucor indicus, 15, 17-19 against microsporum gypseum revealed excellent antifungal activity at an mic value of 6.25 mug/ml.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of calcium sulfate and hydroxyapatite (cerament bone void filler) discs using heat-sensitive and non-heat-sensitive antibiotics against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
background: several absorbable and nonabsorbable antibiotic carrier systems are available in the adjunctive surgical management of osteomyelitis of the foot, ankle, and lower leg. these carrier systems have significant limitations regarding which antibiotics can be successfully incorporated into the carrier vehicle. the calcium sulfate and hydroxyapatite cerament bone void filler is a biocompatible, absorbable ceramic bone void filler that can successfully deliver multiple heat-stable and heat-unstable antibiotics that have not been generally used before with antibiotic beads in treating musculoskeletal infections. methods: cerament bone void filler discs with the antibiotics rifampin, vancomycin, tobramycin, cefazolin, cefepime hydrochloride, vancomycin-tobramycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate were tested in vitro against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. results: the zones of inhibition for the cerament bone void filler antibiotic discs plated against staphylococcus aureus obtained were 33% to 222% greater than the minimum zones of inhibition breakpoints for bacteria susceptibility as defined by the standard set by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. cerament bone void filler discs with the antibiotics plated against pseudomonas aeruginosa produced zones of inhibition of 93% to 200% greater than the minimum zones of inhibition breakpoints for bacteria susceptibility as defined by the standard set by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. conclusions: the calcium sulfate and hydroxyapatite cerament bone void filler was an excellent carrier vehicle for multiple antibiotics creating in vitro significant zones of inhibition, thus demonstrating susceptibility against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which holds tremendous promise in treating osteomyeilits.
antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oil of hofmeisteria schaffneri.
objectives: the aims of this study were to establish the antimicrobial potential  of hofmeisteria schaffneri essential oil and its chemical composition. methods: the essential oils of hofmeisteria schaffneri harvested at flowering (batches i and iv) and non-flowering (batches ii and iii) seasons were prepared by hydrodistillation and analysed by gc and gc-ms. the aqueous and organic (ch(2) cl(2) -meoh 1 : 1) extracts were prepared by using infusion and maceration techniques, respectively. the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of the preparations and compounds against candida albicans and some bacteria (gram-negative and gram-positive) was assessed using the broth dilution method in 96-microplate wells. key findings: forty-four compounds, representing approximately 90% of the total constituents, were identified in the essential oil of hofmeisteria schaffneri collected in flowering (batches i and iv) and non-flowering (batches ii and iii) seasons. in all cases, several thymol analogues were the major components of the oils ( approximately 65%); some small differences in the relative proportions of these constituents were observed. the infusion exhibited an antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, with a mic value of 64 microg/ml in each case. the essential oil batches were active against staphylococcus aureus, with mic ranging from 48 to 192 microg/ml. they were, however, inactive against gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and salmonella typhi (mic > 1024 microg/ml). on the other hand, the infusion of the plant as well as the oil from batch i displayed anti-candida albicans activity, with mic of 128 and 192 microg/ml, respectively. finally, the organic extract did not displayed significant activity against the tested microorganisms (mic >/= 1024 microg/ml). some of the compounds isolated from the plant were also tested. compounds 8 and 38, which were present in the essential oils, displayed the best antibacterial effect against gram-positive bacteria (mic ranging between 32 and 64 microg/ml). compounds 6 (present in the infusion) and 10 (present in all preparations) showed higher activity against the yeast (mic = 128 microg/ml) than the remaining compounds, with mic values ranging from 256 to 512 microg/ml. conclusions: the composition and antimicrobial activity of the oils changed slightly from flowering to non-flowering seasons. the results of the present investigation provide in-vitro scientific support for the use of the plant against skin infections in mexican folk medicine.
improving the antibacterial property of porcine small intestinal submucosa by nano-silver supplementation: a promising biological material to address the need for contaminated defect repair.
objective: we hypothesize that introduction of nano-silver particles to porcine-derived small intestinal submucosa (ns-psis) would lead to significant enhancement in antibacterial property in repairing contaminated abdominal defect. background: porcine-derived small intestinal submucosa (psis) is an acellular and xenogenic biological material intensively used in repairing and regenerating wounded and dysfunctional tissues. surgical site infection (ssi) remains so far a serious problem and major challenge, particularly in contaminated tissue-deficient repairing. methods: self-assembly was used to fabricate ns-psis. the antibacterial property was evaluated in vitro and in vivo by means of repairing full-thickness contaminated abdominal defect in rats. the native psis and polypropylene-oxidized regenerated cellulose were served as controls. in addition, changes in biomechanical resistance, morphology and immunohistochemistry for inflammatory reaction and neovasculation in the repaired abdominal wall were analyzed. biosafety was investigated by pyrogen test, skin irritation test and silver measurement in vivo. results: ns-psis exhibited strong antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa on agar diffusion, with mean diameters of inhibition zone ranging from 11.9 to 23.5 mm. there were significantly lower ssi incidence and a tendency of better abdominal wall resistance in the ns-psis group as compared with the psis or polypropylene-oxidized regenerated cellulose group after repairing contaminated abdominal defect in rats. nano-silver modified psis did not change the native psis property in the tissue recolonization, remodeling and neovascularization. ns-psis was not pyrogenic or skin irritated, without silver residual in vivo after repairing contaminated abdominal defect. conclusion: nano-silver particles to psis lead to significant enhancements in antibacterial property in vitro and in vivo without decreasing its biomechanical resistance and biocompatibility. this study provides proof of concept for the use of nano-silver modified naturally derived psis as an ideal scaffold for ssi prevention in the contaminated tissue-deficient repair.

in vitro activity of fusidic acid (cem-102, sodium fusidate) against staphylococcus aureus isolates from cystic fibrosis patients and its effect on the activities of tobramycin and amikacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and burkholderia cepacia.
we tested the mics of fusidic acid (cem-102) plus other agents against 40 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolates from cystic fibrosis patients and the activities of fusidic acid with or without tobramycin or amikacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa, mrsa, and burkholderia cepacia isolates from cystic fibrosis patients in a 24-h time-kill study. fusidic acid was potent (mics, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; a single 500-mg dose of fusidic acid at 8 h averaged 8 to 12. 5 mug/ml with 91 to 97% protein binding) against all mrsa strains. no antagonism was observed; synergy occurred for one mrsa strain treated with fusidic acid plus tobramycin.
synthesis and biological evaluation of some 4-functionalized-pyrazoles as antimicrobial agents.
1,3-diaryl-4-formylpyrazoles 8 bearing benzenesulfonamide moiety at position-1 were synthesized as important intermediates following vilsmeier-haack strategy. aldehyde moiety of 4-formylpyrazole was then converted into carboxylic acid 9, cyano 10 and carbothioamide 11 using established procedures. out of these 4-functionalized pyrazoles, pyrazole-4-carboxylic acids 9 and carbothioamides 11 were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacterial strains namely, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis (gram-positive), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative), and in vitro antifungal activity against two pathogenic fungal strains namely, aspergillus niger and aspergillus flavus. three tested compounds, 9e, 11b and 11f exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria and 9g showed moderate antifungal activity against the tested fungi. however, none of the compounds showed any activity against gram-negative bacteria.
curcumin nanoparticles: preparation, characterization, and antimicrobial study.
curcumin is a highly potent, nontoxic, bioactive agent found in turmeric and has  been known for centuries as a household remedy to many ailments. the only disadvantage that it suffers is of low aqueous solubility and poor bioavailability. the aim of the present study was to develop a method for the preparation of nanoparticles of curcumin with a view to improve its aqueous-phase solubility and examine the effect on its antimicrobial properties. nanoparticles of curcumin (nanocurcumin) were prepared by a process based on a wet-milling technique and were found to have a narrow particle size distribution in the range of 2-40 nm. unlike curcumin, nanocurcumin was found to be freely dispersible in water in the absence of any surfactants. the chemical structure of nanocurcumin was the same as that of curcumin, and there was no modification during nanoparticle preparation. a minimum inhibitory concentration of nanocurcumin was determined for a variety of bacterial and fungal strains and was compared to that of curcumin. it was found that the aqueous dispersion of nanocurcumin was much more effective than curcumin against staphylococcus aureus , bacillus subtilis , escherichia coli , pseudomonas aeruginosa , penicillium notatum , and aspergillus niger . the results demonstrated that the water solubility and antimicrobial activity of curcumin markedly improved by particle size reduction up to the nano range. for the selected microorganisms, the activity of nanocurcumin was more pronounced against gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, its antibacterial activity was much better than antifungal activity. the mechanism of antibacterial action of curcumin nanoparticles was investigated by transmission electron micrograph (tem) analysis, which revealed that these particles entered inside the bacterial cell by completely breaking the cell wall, leading to cell death.
synthesis, stereochemistry, antimicrobial evaluation and qsar studies of 2,6-diaryltetrahydropyran-4-one thiosemicarbazones.
a series of 2,6-diaryltetrahydropyran-4-one thiosemicarbazones (11-27) were synthesized and characterized for evaluation of potential antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, bacillus subtilis and klebsiella pneumonia and antifungal activity against cryptococcus neoformans, candida albicans, rhizopus sp., aspergillus niger and aspergillus flavus were evaluated. compounds 21 and 22 showed maximum inhibition potency at low concentration (6.25 mug/ml) against p. aeruginosa. for antifungal activity, 20 and 21 were effective against c. neoformans and 22-24 against c. albicans at minimum concentration. further, the results of qsar studies of these synthesized compounds indicated the importance of weakly polar component of surface area, hydrophobicity and ionization potential parameters in defining their antimicrobial activity.
triterpenoid saponins from symplocos lancifolia.
three new bidesmosidic saponins (1-3) and a new ursane triterpenoid, 2alpha,3beta,11alpha,23-tetrahydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid (4), along with seven known compounds, were isolated from a methanolic extract of the leaves of symplocos lancifolia. the bidesmosidic saponins were found to possess the same sugar unit part, composed of two beta-d-glucose moieties and one alpha-l-rhamnose moiety, linked to maslinic acid, arjunolic acid, and asiatic acid, respectively. their structures were elucidated by interpretation of their 1d and 2d nmr spectra and completed by analysis of the hresims data. the antibacterial activity of the isolated triterpenoids was evaluated against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and several showed activity against gram-positive bacteria.
highly effective, water-soluble, hemocompatible 1,3-propylene oxide-based antimicrobials: poly[(3,3-quaternary/peg)-copolyoxetanes].
this study focuses on the solution antimicrobial effectiveness of a novel class of copolyoxetanes with quaternary ammonium and peg-like side chains. a precursor p[(bbox-m)(me2ox)] copolyoxetane was prepared by cationic ring-opening copolymerization of 3-((4-bromobutoxy)methyl)-3-methyloxetane (bbox) and 3-((2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)methyl)-3-methyloxetane (me2ox) to give random copolymers with 14-100 (m) mol % bbox. reaction of p[(bbox-m)(me2ox)] with dodecyl dimethylamine gave the corresponding quaternary p[(c12-m)(me2ox)] polycation salts, designated c12-m, as viscous liquids in 100% yield. bbox/me2ox and c12/me2ox ratios were obtained by (1)h nmr spectroscopy. c12-m molecular weights (m(n), 3.5-21.9 kda) were obtained from (1)h nmr end group analysis. dsc studies up to 150 degrees c showed only thermal transitions between -69 and -34 degrees c assigned to t(g) values. antibacterial activity for the c12-m copolyoxetanes was tested by determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) against gram(+) staphylococcus aureus and gram(-) escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa . mic decreased with increasing c12 mol percent, reaching a minimum in the range c12-43 to c12-60. overall, the antimicrobial with consistently low mics for the three tested pathogenic bacteria was c12-43: (bacteria, mic, mug/ml) e. coli (6), s. aureus (5), and p. aeruginosa (33). for c12-43, minimum biocidal concentration (mbc) to reach 99.99% kill in 24 h required 1.5x mic for s. aureus and 2x mic for e. coli and p. aeruginosa . at 5x mic against a challenge of 10(8) cfu/ml, c12-43 kills >/=99% s. aureus , e. coli , and p. aeruginosa within 1 h. c12-m copolyoxetane cytotoxicity toward human red blood cells was low, indicating good prospects for biocompatibility. the tunability of c12-m copolyoxetane compositions, effective antimicrobial behavior against gram(+) and gram(-) bacteria, and promising biocompatibility offer opportunities for further modification and potential applications as therapeutic agents.
efficient screening of a novel antimicrobial peptide from jatropha curcas by cell membrane affinity chromatography.
a novel method named cell membrane affinity chromatography was used to screen antimicrobial peptides from jatropha curcas . a cationic antimicrobial peptide (kvflglk, jcpep7) was successfully isolated and identified. antimicrobial assays indicated that jcpep7 was active against the tested microorganisms ( salmonella typhimurium atcc 50013, shigella dysenteriae atcc 51302, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27553, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, bacillus subtilis atcc 23631, and streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619) with minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranging from 24 to 64 mug/ml. the antimicrobial mechanisms based on fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (tem) techniques showed that jcpep7 killed microbes principally via breaking of their cell walls and membranes, followed by cell lysis. the results indicated that cell membrane affinity chromatography could be a promising approach for high-throughput screening of antimicrobial peptides from j. curcas .
a novel cationic ribonuclease with antimicrobial activity from rana dybowskii.
a novel ribonuclease (rnase) a superfamily gene (rdronc) has been cloned from the frog rana dybowskii. the deduced amino acid sequence shows that it belongs to the ribonuclease a superfamily, with the highest identity, 73%, to rana pipiens onconase. adaptive evolution analysis based on maximum likelihood models of codon substitution has been conducted on 10 members of the rana rnases of subcluster b. rapid adaptive evolution and multiple positive selection sites have been detected, which indicates that these genes may be evolving under positive selection pressure. functional assay demonstrates that the recombinant rdronc protein possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and weaker antimicrobial activity against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and yeast candida albicans. our findings support the hypothesis that ribonuclease a superfamily members may function in host defense of early-diversified vertebrates.
interactions between various microbes and ginseng botanicals.
three kinds of interactions occur between ginseng botanicals and microorganisms:  a) spoilage of the botanical by various fungi (e.g., aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria, and eurotium species) and bacteria; b) transformation of ginsenosides into more bioactive forms by bacteria such as intrasporangium sp. gs603, microbacterium sp. gs514, caulobacter leidyia, bifidobacterium sp. int57, bifidobacterium sp. sj32, fusobacterium sp. and bacteroides sp., and moulds (e.g., aspergillus niger, fusarium sacchari, paecilomyces bainier sp. 229, rhizopus stolonifer, myrothecium verrucaria and acremonium strictum); and c) inhibition of certain bacteria (propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa), fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, fusarium oxysporum) and viruses by ginseng constituents.
spectroscopic, structure and antimicrobial activity of new y(iii) and zr(iv) ciprofloxacin.
the preparation and characterization of the new solid complexes [y(cip)2(h2o)2]cl(3).10h2o and [zro(cip)2cl]cl.15h2o formed in the reaction of ciprofloxacin (cip) with ycl3 and zrocl(2).8h2o in ethanol and methanol, respectively, at room temperature were reported. the isolated complexes have been characterized with elemental analysis, ir spectroscopy, conductance measurements, uv-vis and 1h nmr spectroscopic methods and thermal analyses. the results support the formation of the complexes and indicate that ciprofloxacin reacts as a bidentate ligand bound to the metal ion through the pyridone oxygen and one carboxylato oxygen. the activation energies, e*; entropies, deltas*; enthalpies, deltah*; gibbs free energies, deltag*, of the thermal decomposition reactions have been derived from thermogravimetric (tga) and differential thermogravimetric (dtg) curves, using coats-redfern and horowitz-metzeger methods. the proposed structure of the two complexes was detected by using the density functional theory (dft) at the b3lyp/cep-31g level of theory. the ligand as well as their metal complexes was also evaluated for their antibacterial activity against several bacterial species, such as staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), escherichia coli (e. coli) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and antifungal screening was studied against two species (penicillium (p. rotatum) and trichoderma (t. sp.)). this study showed that the metal complexes are more antibacterial as compared to free ligand and no antifungal activity observed for ligand and their complexes.
study of ocular drug delivery system using drug-loaded liposomes.
background: this project aims to formulate and characterize a drug-eluting contact lens to provide controlled release of drug for a longer period of time, using liposomes as drug delivery system. materials and methods: drug delivering contact lenses were created by coating disposable soft contact lenses with ciprofloxacin entrapped in the liposomes. reverse phase evaporation and lipid film hydration methods were used for the preparation of ciprofloxacin trapping reverse phase evaporation vesicles, that is, unilamellar vesicles (revs) and multilamellar vesicles (mlvs), respectively. soya lecithin and cholesterol (ch) were used in the molar ratios of 7:4 and 7:2. the spherical structure of the liposomes, the mean diameter, and their purity were determined by photomicroscopic, transmission electron microscope, and chromatographic analysis, respectively. the prepared liposomes were evaluated for their entrapment efficiency, in vitro drug release, stability, and toxicity. results: mlvs were larger than revs with their mean diameter 338.32 nm and also entrapped greater amount of ciprofloxacin. drug loading and its release from the liposomal vesicles was dependent on ch content. ciprofloxacin released from the liposomes coated on the contact lenses not only inhibited both staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa on an agar plate but also showed an enhanced antibacterial effect as determined by minimal inhibitory concentrations. approximately 40% of ciprofloxacin was retained up to a period of 3 months at 4 degrees c. furthermore, the formulation was found to be nontoxic and also a reduction in toxicity of ciprofloxacin was observed after entrapment when assessed by lymphocyte toxicity assay and chick embryo inoculation. conclusions: an innovative drug delivery system consisting of drug-loaded liposomes coated onto the surface of contact lenses has been developed. this system is highly specific in terms of localized and sustained application of the drug.
reliability of quantitative real-time pcr for bacterial detection in cystic fibrosis airway specimens.
the cystic fibrosis (cf) airway microbiome is complex; polymicrobial infections are common, and the presence of fastidious bacteria including anaerobes make culture-based diagnosis challenging. quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) offers a culture-independent method for bacterial quantification that may improve diagnosis of cf airway infections; however, the reliability of qpcr applied to cf airway specimens is unknown. we sought to determine the reliability of nine specific bacterial qpcr assays (total bacteria, three typical cf pathogens, and five anaerobes) applied to cf airway specimens. airway and salivary specimens from clinically stable pediatric cf subjects were collected. quantitative pcr assay repeatability was determined using triplicate reactions. split-sample measurements were performed to measure variability introduced by dna extraction. results from qpcr were compared to standard microbial culture for pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus influenzae, common pathogens in cf. we obtained 84 sputa, 47 oropharyngeal and 27 salivary specimens from 16 pediatric subjects with cf. quantitative pcr detected bacterial dna in over 97% of specimens. all qpcr assays were highly reproducible at quantities>/=10(2) rrna gene copies/reaction with coefficient of variation less than 20% for over 99% of samples. there was also excellent agreement between samples processed in duplicate. anaerobic bacteria were highly prevalent and were detected in mean quantities similar to that of typical cf pathogens. compared to a composite gold standard, qpcr and culture had variable sensitivities for detection of p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and h. influenzae from cf airway samples. by reliably quantifying fastidious airway bacteria, qpcr may improve our understanding of polymicrobial cf lung infections, progression of lung disease and ultimately improve antimicrobial treatments.
biological screening of araripe basin medicinal plants using artemia salina leach and pathogenic bacteria.
background: many medicinal plant species from the araripe basin are widely known  and used in folk medicine and for commercial manufacturing of phytotherapeutic products. few ethnobotanical and pharmacological studies have been undertaken in this region, however, in spite of the great cultural and biological diversity found there. materials and methods: extracts of 11 plant species collected from ceara state, brazil, were subjected to the brine shrimp lethality test in order to detect potential sources of novel cytotoxic, antitumor compounds. the larvicidal activity, based on the percentage of larval mortality, was evaluated after 24 h exposure to the treatments. results: all species tested showed good larvicidal activity as compared to a reference compound and literature data. the extract from vanillosmopsis arborea was the most active with an lc(50) of 3.9 mug/ml. best results were shown by lantana montevidensis against pseudomonas aeruginosa [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) 8mug/ml] and escherichia coli (mic 32 mug/ml), zanthoxylum rhoifolium against e. coli (mic, 256 mug/ml) and staphylococcus aureus (mic 64 mug/ml) and croton zenhtneri against s. aureus (mic 64 mug/ml). conclusion: chemical tests indicated that a wide variety of natural product classes was present in those extracts that showed significant activities in the bioassays.
changing epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections in 11 teaching hospitals in taiwan between 1993 and 2006.
background/purpose: healthcare-associated infections, formerly known as nosocomial infections, are one of the most important issues in current practice. understanding trends in overall infection rates, as well as their incidence and proportion among different causative organisms, can help us to better define our infection control methods and therapy goals. to understand the changing epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections (bsi) in taiwan, we retrospectively collected nosocomial infection data from 11 hospitals and examined the trends and changing patterns of nosocomial bsi. methods: eleven major teaching hospitals in taiwan were invited to participate in the study. the overall density of nosocomial infections and major bsi-causing organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and candida species, were collected. the distribution of the different candida species was also recorded. background parameters from the 11 hospitals, including the size of the hospital, hospital capacity, the number of blood stream infection events, and average length of stay, were also recorded. results: the incidence of nosocomial bsi ranged 0.23-2.56 per 1,000 patient-days, which accounted for 8-43% of all nosocomial infections. the most common causative organism of nosocomial bacteremia was s. aureus, ranging 0.88-0.01 per 1,000 patient-days. overall, the incidence of s. aureus bacteremia has decreased over the last 13 years, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.053). the rate of candida fungemia (p < 0.01) and a. baumannii (p = 0.03) bacteremia increased significantly. c. albicans accounted for most cases of nosocomial fungemia, ranging from 40% to 80%, followed by candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis and candida glabrata. however, the incidence varied significantly from hospital to hospital, and the highest incidence was observed in a cancer center. conclusion: the overall incidence rate of s. aureus bacteremia in the 11 major hospitals studied had decreased over the last decade, though the difference was not statistically significant. however, the rate of candida fungemia and a. baumannii bacteremia had increased significantly.
antibacterial action of a heat-stable form of l-amino acid oxidase isolated from  king cobra (ophiophagus hannah) venom.
the major l-amino acid oxidase (laao, ec 1.4.3.2) of king cobra (ophiophagus hannah) venom is known to be an unusual form of snake venom laao as it possesses unique structural features and unusual thermal stability. the antibacterial effects of king cobra venom laao were tested against several strains of clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli using broth microdilution assay. for comparison, the antibacterial effects of several antibiotics (cefotaxime, kanamycin, tetracycline, vancomycin and penicillin) were also examined using the same conditions. king cobra venom laao was very effective in inhibiting the two gram-positive bacteria (s. aureus and s. epidermidis) tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.78mug/ml (0.006mum) and 1.56mug/ml (0.012mum) against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, respectively. the mics are comparable to the mics of the antibiotics tested, on a weight basis. however, the laao was only moderately effective against three gram-negative bacteria tested (p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and e. coli), with mic ranges from 25 to 50mug/ml (0.2-0.4mum). catalase at the concentration of 1mg/ml abolished the antibacterial effect of laao, indicating that the antibacterial effect of the enzyme involves generation of hydrogen peroxide. binding studies indicated that king cobra venom laao binds strongly to the gram-positive s. aureus and s. epidermidis, but less strongly to the gram-negative e. coli and p. aeruginosa, indicating that specific binding to bacteria is important for the potent antibacterial activity of the enzyme.
comparative activity of ceftobiprole against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates from europe and the middle east: the class study.
objectives: to assess the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole and comparators against a recent collection of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, in order to detect potential changes in susceptibility patterns, and to evaluate the etest assay for ceftobiprole susceptibility testing. methods: contemporary gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates) from across europe and the middle east were collected, and their susceptibility to ceftobiprole, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, ceftazidime and cefepime was assessed using the etest method. quality testing [using etest and broth microdilution (bmd)] was conducted at a central reference laboratory. results: some 5041 gram-positive and 4026 gram-negative isolates were included. against gram-positive isolates overall, ceftobiprole had the lowest mic50 (0.5 mg/l), compared with 1 mg/l for its comparators (vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid). against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, all four agents had a similar mic90 (2 mg/l), but ceftobiprole had a 4-fold better mic90 (0.5 mg/l) against methicillin-susceptible strains. only 38 gram-positive isolates were confirmed as ceftobiprole resistant. among gram-negative strains, 86.9%, 91.7% and 95.2% were susceptible to ceftobiprole, ceftazidime and cefepime, respectively. pseudomonas aeruginosa was less susceptible to all three antimicrobials than any other gram-negative pathogen. there was generally good agreement between local etest results and those obtained at the reference laboratory (for ceftobiprole: 86.8% with gram-negatives; and 94.7% with gram-positives), as well as between results obtained by bmd and etest methods (for ceftobiprole: 98.2% with gram-negatives; and 98.4% with gram-positives). conclusions: ceftobiprole exhibits in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. no changes in its known susceptibility profile were identified.
duckweed (lemna minor) as a model plant system for the study of human microbial pathogenesis.
background: plant infection models provide certain advantages over animal models  in the study of pathogenesis. however, current plant models face some limitations, e.g., plant and pathogen cannot co-culture in a contained environment. development of such a plant model is needed to better illustrate host-pathogen interactions. methodology/principal findings: we describe a novel model plant system for the study of human pathogenic bacterial infection on a large scale. this system was initiated by co-cultivation of axenic duckweed (lemna minor) plants with pathogenic bacteria in 24-well polystyrene cell culture plate. pathogenesis of bacteria to duckweed was demonstrated with pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus as two model pathogens. p. aeruginosa pao1 caused severe detriment to duckweed as judged from inhibition to frond multiplication and chlorophyll formation. using a gfp-marked pao1 strain, we demonstrated that bacteria colonized on both fronds and roots and formed biofilms. virulence of pao1 to duckweed was attenuated in its quorum sensing (qs) mutants and in recombinant strains overexpressing the qs quenching enzymes. rn4220, a virulent strain of s. aureus, caused severe toxicity to duckweed while an avirulent strain showed little effect. using this system for antimicrobial chemical selection, green tea polyphenols exhibited inhibitory activity against s. aureus virulence. this system was further confirmed to be effective as a pathogenesis model using a number of pathogenic bacterial species. conclusions/significance: our results demonstrate that duckweed can be used as a fast, inexpensive and reproducible model plant system for the study of host-pathogen interactions, could serve as an alternative choice for the study of some virulence factors, and could also potentially be used in large-scale screening for the discovery of antimicrobial chemicals.
evaluation of tigecycline activity in clinical isolates among indian medical centers.
background: resistance to multiple antibiotics among gram-positive cocci (gpc) and gram negative bacilli (gnb) is high in india. tigecycline, a glycylcycline antibiotic is a newer treatment option for emerging single or multidrug-resistant (mdr) gpc and gnb. material and method: we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline and compared it against other antimicrobials. between 2005-2007, seven indian medical centers from diverse geographic regions forwarded 727 isolates [escherichia coli (166), staphylococcus aureus (125), klebsiella spp (120), streptococcus pneumoniae (102), enterococcus spp. (100), pseudomonas aeruginosa (50), acinetobacter spp. (50) and enterobacter spp. (14)] from patients with blood stream (bsi), skin and soft tissue (ssti) including surgical site, urinary tract and respiratory infections to our reference laboratory. susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials besides tigecycline included: vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, quinopristin-dalfopristin, daptomycin, amikacin, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam was determined by agar dilution and etest method. result: tigecycline was active against all gpc (mic 90 < 0.25 mug/ml), e. coli and klebsiella spp. (mic 90 </=1 mug/ml). mdr acinetobacter spp. showed lower susceptibility (70.6%) to tigecycline. tigecycline mic 90 values were not influenced by oxacillin resistance among s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, vancomycin resistance in enterococci (vre) and esbl producing e. coli, klebsiella spp. and enterobacter spp. increased resistance was seen to other antimicrobials among esbl producing e. coli, klebsiella spp., metallo beta lactamase (mbl) producing p. aeruginosa and vre. conclusion: tigecycline is an alternative option for emerging multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens exhibiting promising spectrum/potency exceeding currently available agents seen in india.
[susceptibility surveillance of clinical isolates to fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents from 2003 to 2008: post-marketing study of prulifloxacin].
yearly changes in the susceptibility of clinical isolates to ulifloxacin (ufx) and other fluoroquinolones were examined through surveys over 3 periods. in the first survey, 534 strains derived from 19 species were collected from clinical specimens during 6 months from december 2003 to may 2004. in the same way, 805 strains were collected from december 2005 to may 2006 in the second survey, and 863 strains were from december 2007 to may 2008 in the third survey. over these 3 study periods, the susceptibilities of fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were decreased. the isolation frequency of levofloxacin-nonsusceptible strain was increased from 0% to 11.8% and from 14.6% to 20.8%, respectively. mic90s of ufx against these pathogens were also increased, but its mic90 for e. coli was 2 to 4 times lower than that of levofloxacin. on the other hand, the susceptibility of strains of klebsiella pneumoniae to ufx was increased. among the fluoroquinolones tested, ufx showed the most potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and no changes in the mic90s occurred during the surveillance. although one strain of streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in the third study period showed levofloxacin-resistance (mic, 8 microg/ml), there were nearly no changes in the mic90s of any agents tested including ufx against s. pneumoniae during the surveillance. as for other bacterial species, a tendency to increase in resistance to ufx was not observed. the activity of ufx against salmonella spp. and shigella spp. was superior/equal to those of fluoroquinolones tested.
antimicrobial peptides on calcium phosphate-coated titanium for the prevention of implant-associated infections.
prevention of implant-associated infections has been one of the main challenges in orthopaedic surgery. this challenge is further complicated by the concern over the development of antibiotic resistance as a result of using traditional antibiotics for infection prophylaxis. the objective of this study was to develop a technique that enables the loading and local delivery of a unique group of cationic antimicrobial peptides (amp) through implant surfaces. a thin layer of micro-porous calcium phosphate (cap) coating was processed by electrolytic deposition onto the surface of titanium as the drug carrier. the broad spectrum amp tet213 (krwwkwwrrc) was selected and loaded onto the cap coating. sem, xrd and ftir analyses confirmed the cap coating to be micro-porous octacalcium phosphate. by using a luminescence spectrometer technique, it was demonstrated that a 7 mum thick porous cap coating could load up to 9 mug of amp/cm(2) using a simple soaking technique. the drug-loaded cap coating (cap-tet213) was not cytotoxic for mg-63 osteoblast-like cells. the cap-tet213 implants had antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria with 10(6)-fold reductions of both bacterial strains within 30 min as assessed by measuring colony-forming units (cfu). repeated cfu assays on the same cap-tet213 specimen demonstrated retention of antimicrobial activity by the cap-tet213 surfaces through four test cycles. the susceptibility of bacteria to the cap-tet213 surfaces was also evaluated by assessing the inhibition of luminescence of p. aeruginosa containing a luxcdabe cassette at 4 h and 24 h with approximately 92% and approximately 77% inhibition of luminescence, respectively. it was demonstrated that cap-tet213 was a more efficient antimicrobial coating than cap-mx226, cap-hlf1-11 or cap-tobramycin following incubation of cap implants with equimolar concentrations of tet213, the commercially developed antimicrobial peptide mx-226, hlf1-11 or tobramycin. a device coated with cap-tet213 could be a potential solution for the prevention of the peri-implant infection in orthopaedics.
chitosan-edta new combination is a promising candidate for treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
chitosan is an attractive preparation widely used as a pharmaceutical excipient.  this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of chitosan derivatives, edta, and the newly developed chitosan-edta combination against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as candida albicans. antimicrobial activity was studied. both minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimal biocidal concentrations (mbc) were determined. chitosan acetic acid recorded lower mic values against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans than those exhibited by edta. edta failed to have inhibitory activity against enterococcus faecalis as well as mbc against any of the studied microorganisms. chitosan acetic acid's mbc were recorded to all examined species. checkerboard assay results indicated a synergistic antimicrobial activity of the new combination against staphylococcus aureus and an additive effect against other microorganisms. moreover, a short microbial exposure to chitosan-edta (20-30 min) caused complete eradication. due to the continuous emergence of resistant strains, there is an urgent need to discover new antimicrobial agents. our findings suggest the use of chitosan as an enhancing agent with antibacterial and antifungal properties in combination with edta in pharmaceutical preparations.
induction of antibacterial activity in larvae of the blowfly lucilia sericata by  an infected environment.
maggot debridement therapy (mdt) is a method for the treatment of intractable, infected and necrotic wounds. in mdt, sterile larvae of lucilia sericata meigen (diptera: calliphoridae) are applied to infected wounds, where they exert antibacterial effects. once the larvae are placed in the wound, they are no longer germ-free. this study analysed the influence of infected environments on larval antibacterial activities. sterile larvae were mixed in a test tube containing a bacterial suspension of staphylococcus aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa, transferred to liver puree agar, and incubated at 25 degrees c for set periods. to collect the larval extracts, the incubated larvae were transferred to a test tube containing phosphate buffered saline (pbs), cut into multiple pieces with scissors, and centrifuged. the supernatant was used to test antibacterial activities. the results showed that infected larvae had better antibacterial capacities than sterile larvae. antibacterial activities were induced by pretreatment with a single bacterial species, s. aureus or p. aeruginosa, within 24 h and 12 h, respectively, and disappeared after 36 h. the activities were effective against s. aureus, but not against p. aeruginosa. this natural infection model is very similar to the clinical wound context in mdt and will be a powerful tool with which to study the antibacterial activities of l. sericata larvae in mdt.
synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. this study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin for enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. a range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. the results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on s. aureus. minimal concentrations and mbc of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. the mbc of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against s. aureus were also decreased. the other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. the synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.
bacteria competing with the adhesion and biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus.
the activity of antagonistic substances produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa and lactobacillus acidophilus against the planktonic and sessile populations of staphylococcus aureus strains was demonstrated. the strongest effects were caused by probiotic l. acidophilus strain - bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) positive. however, the s. aureus a3 growth, adhesion and biofilm formation was also limited by cell-free supernatant of l. acidophilus h-1 (blis negative). moreover, competitive direct interactions were observed between staphylococci and the above bacteria, which influenced the formation of dualspecies aggregates on the surface.
characterization and antimicrobial activity of 4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl thiocarboxamide; a novel bioactive compound from moringa oleifera seed extract.
antimicrobial activity of crude seed extract of moringa oleifera was investigated by thin layer chromatography bioassay against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, cladosporium cladosporioides, and penicillium sclerotigenum; most of them were prominently inhibited by an isolate with r(f) 0.92-0.96. characterization and identification of the extract revealed the occurrence of three bioactive compounds: 4-(alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate, methyl n-4-(alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyloxy) benzyl carbamate (both known compounds), and 4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl thiocarboxamide, existence of which in any moringa spp. or plant is reported for the first time. the uv spectrum of the novel compound showed maximum absorption at 273 and 225 nm in meoh while the ir spectrum revealed several characteristic bands at 3100, 2900, 1700, 1500, 1300, 1100 and 1000 cm(-1). the (1)h-nmr showed signals at 1.2 and 3.77 ppm and the (13)c-nmr presented signals at 155, 122, 91.7 and 98.4 ppm. all the compounds at 5 mg/l had very high bactericidal activity against some of test pathogens even at contact period 1-2 h. 4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyloxy)benzyl thiocarboxamide was the most potent, with 99.2 % inhibition toward shigella dysenteriae and 100 % toward bacillus cereus, e. coli and salmonella typhi within 4 h of contact.
progress and challenges in implementing the research on eskape pathogens.
the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. however, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. in addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. the difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.
the impact of fluoroquinolones use on antibiotic resistance in an intensive care  burn department.
background: fluoroquinolones (fq) use has been identified as a risk factor for colonization and infection to methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus(mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosae multiresistant(pmr), acinetobacter multiresistant (amr) and multidrug resistant bacteria(mdrb). aim: our study proposes to measure the annual antibiotic use of fq and antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and a. baumannii in an intensive care burn unit. methods: the study was conducted during a 4 year period (1 january 2000 to 31 december 2003). antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method as recommended by the french society of microbiology. the consumption of the following antibiotics: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin was expressed as the antimicrobial use density (ad) taking into account the quantity of antibiotics in grams converted to defined daily doses (ddd) and the number of day hospitalization. statistical significance was defined as p value < 0. 0 5 for the corresponding correlation coefficient. results: there were statistically significant relationship between use of ciprofloxacin and resistance in p. aeruginosa to this drug (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05). moreover, the ciprofloxacin consumption was correlated with resistance to imipenem (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05) and ceftazidime (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05) in p. aeruginosa . a restriction use of ciprofloxacin has been taken during 2003, it is followed by a significant decrease of resistance to imipenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin in p. aeruginosa (p<0, 05 ). the use of fluoroquinolones was correlated significantly with mrsa (rs=0. 96, p<0. 05) . the restriction use of fq was significantly associated with a decrease of mrsa. the consumption of ciprofloxacin was also correlated (p<0. 05) with resistance of ceftazidime in k. pneumoniae. however, there is not a correlation (p> 0. 05) between fluoroquinolones use and resistance in a. baumannii as well in ciprofloxacin, imipenem and ceftazidime. conclusion: our study illustrates the pressure of selection of fluoroquinolones use in the development of mdrb. the use and or the duration of treatment with theses antibiotics should be rationalised as part of efforts to control the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of traditional thai herbal remedies for  aphthous ulcers.
four medicinal plants (quercus infectoria, kaempferia galanga, coptis chinensis and glycyrrhiza uralensis) as well as one traditional thai treatment for aphthous ulcers based on these four plants were tested for antimicrobial activity. mic values for a range of bacteria and candida albicans were determined, with both type strains and clinical isolates being used. antioxidant activity was determined using the abts radical scavenging assay. among the four plants, q. infectoria showed antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus with an mic of 0.41 mg/ml, while c. chinensis showed antifungal activity against c. albicans with an mic of 6.25 mg/ml. activity was also shown against a range of other organisms including salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the antimicrobial activity of the traditional aphthous ulcer preparation (a powder) was comparable to that for the individual plant extracts, however, incorporation of the powder into a gel formulation resulted in the loss of almost all activity. all extracts, with the exception of k. galanga, also showed good antioxidant activity. this study supports the traditional use of these plants and suggests that they may also be useful in the treatment of other infections.
light insensitive silver(i) cyanoximates as antimicrobial agents for indwelling medical devices.
ten silver(i) cyanoximates of agl composition (l = nc-c(no)-r, where r is electron withdrawing groups: -cn, -c(o)nr(2), -c(o)r' (alkyl), -c(o)oet, 2-heteroaryl fragments such as 2-pyridyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-benzthiazolyl) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods and x-ray analysis. crystal structures of four complexes were determined and revealed the formation of two-dimensional (2d) coordination polymers of different complexity in which anions exhibit bridging or combined chelate and bridging binding modes. in these compounds, anions are in the nitroso form. all studied agl complexes are sparingly soluble in water and are thermally stable to 150 degrees c. synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable insensitivity toward visible light and uv-radiation, which was explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple covalent bonds between bridging cyanoxime ligands and ag(i) centers. all 10 silver(i) cyanoximates were tested in vitro on the subject of their antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus hirae, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and mycobacterium fortuitum as well as against candida albicans in solutions, and in the solid state as pressed pellets and dried filter paper disks presoaked with solutions of agl in dmf. results showed pronounced antimicrobial activity for all investigated complexes. a combination of five factors: (1) light insensitivity, (2) poor water solubility, (3) high thermal stability, (4) lack of toxicity of organic ligands, and (5) in vitro antimicrobial activity allows development of silver(i) cyanoximates for medical applications. these include antimicrobial additives to acrylate glue, cured by uv-radiation, used in introduction of prosthetic joints and dental implants, and prevention of biofilm formation on several types of indwelling medical devices.

design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 3-(4-halophenyl)-3-oxopropanal and their derivatives as novel antibacterial agents.
in continuing our program aimed to search for potent drugs for bacterial infections, a series of 3-(4-halophenyl)-3-oxopropanal and their derivatives were designed, synthesized and their antibacterial activities in vitro against both gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated. compounds 7, 8, 13-16, 21 and 22 had moderate antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus (minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) <16 microg/ml), suggesting that the introduction of mono-methoxyamine or ethoxyamine moiety might play an important role in determining the potent antibacterial activities. furthermore, the antibacterial activities of select compounds 7, 15 and 16 against the clinically important pathogenic bacteria-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were also investigated. results showed that these compounds exhibited more potent activities than the well-known antibacterial agents houttuynin and levofloxacin.
design, synthesis and in vitro evaluation of antitubercular and antimicrobial activity of some novel pyranopyrimidines.
the clinical significance of pyran and pyrimidine condensed systems and the raise in problem of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens has directed us to synthesize pyranopyrimidine derivatives via the reactions of the versatile, 2-amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4h-substituted chromene-3-carbonitrile with the appropriate reagents. the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by ir, (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr, mass spectra and elemental analysis. the compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antitubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h(37)rv [atcc-27294] and antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus [atcc-25923] and streptococcus pyogenes [mtcc-443] as gram-positive, escherichia coli [atcc-25922] and pseudomonas aeruginosa [mtcc-441] as gram-negative bacterial strains and antifungal activity against aspergillus niger [mtcc-282]. several derivatives exhibited pronounced antitubercular and antimicrobial activities.
synthesis and evaluation of novel bis[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazoles as potent antimicrobial agents.
a series of novel bis[4-methoxy-3-(6-aryl[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol)phenyl]methanes 5a-l has been synthesized and characterized via ir, 1h nmr, 13c nmr, ms and elemental analyses. all the newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against bacillus subtilis, bacillus sphaericu, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klobsinella aerogenes and chromobacterium violaceum and antifungal activity against candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, trichophyton rubrum and trichophyton mentagrophytes. compounds 5e, 5f, 5h, 5i, 5k and 5l exhibited potent activity against the test bacteria and fungi, and emerged as potential molecules for further development.
cajanol inhibits the growth of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus by acting on membrane and dna damage.
in the present study, the mechanism of antibacterial activity of cajanol extracted from the roots of cajanus cajan (l.) millsp. towards escherichia coli (e. coli) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) was investigated. the antibacterial activity of cajanol was evaluated towards six bacterial strains (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) by the broth microdilution method. it showed strong antibacterial activity towards all bacteria tested with minimal inhibition concentration (mic) values ranging from 98.90 microm to 197.8 microm. cajanol-induced death rates in the most sensitive strains ( e.coli, 96.55 % and s. aureus, 97.25 %) were analyzed by flow cytometry. furthermore, the activity of cajanol on the membranes of e. coli and s. aureus was investigated by using lecithin, phosphate groups, and fluorescence microscopy. cajanol-induced dna damage was observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. in summary, cajanol inhibited e. coli only by dna damage, whereas s. aureus was inhibited by affecting both, the lecithin and phosphate groups on the cellular membrane and dna. the present study shows that cajanol possesses antibacterial activity in vitro towards both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and therefore may be a promising candidate as an antibacterial agent for the therapy of microbial infections.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel fluorine containing 4-(substituted-2-hydroxybenzoyl)-1h-pyrazoles and pyrazolyl benzo[d]oxazoles.
a series of fluorine containing 4-(substituted-2-hydroxybenzoyl) pyrazoles and pyrazolyl benzo[d]oxazoles were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus subtilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans. the antibacterial activities were expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic50) in microg/ml. the compounds 1-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(5-fluoro-2-hydroxybenzoyl)-1h-pyrazole (4b), oxime derivatives such as 1-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-1h-pyrazol-4-yl)(2-hydroxy-4-methylphenyl)methanone oxime (5b) and (5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)(1-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-1h-pyrazol-4-yl)methanone oxime (5e) exhibited promising activities against tested bacterial strains. except compound 1-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)-1h-pyrazole (4d), none of the other compounds showed promising antifungal activity.
seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd in southern brazil.
the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd grown in southern brazil was analyzed by gc-ms, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. the yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. the results obtained from principal components analysis (pca) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. the samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. samples collected during winter contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). in autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. the observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. the essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, and enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), indicated that s. aureus, b. subtilis, and candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest mic values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/ml, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/ml, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/ml, respectively.
in vitro antibacterial evaluation of anabaena sp. against several clinically significant microflora and hptlc analysis of its active crude extracts.
the present study was conducted to evaluate the possible antibacterial activity of anabaena extracts. anabaena was isolated from a natural source and cultured in vitro. after suitable growth, cyanobacterial culture was harvested using different solvents. extracts, thus prepared, were evaluated for their antibacterial potential by agar-well diffusion assay against bacterial species of clinical significance. mic values were determined further to check the concentration ranges for significant inhibition. hptlc analysis was done to separate the components of active crude extract in an attempt to identify the bio-active chemical entity. methanol extract exhibited more potent activity than that of hexane and ethyl acetate extracts. no inhibitory effect was found against pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, and klebsiella pneumoniae. staphylococcus aureus required about 256 microg/ml of the crude methanol extract for effective inhibition. hptlc evaluation at lambda 254 nm was performed for the separation of a complex mixture of the methanol extract. the results provide evidence that anabaena sp. extracts might indeed be potential sources of new antibacterial agents.
sodium nitrite-mediated killing of the major cystic fibrosis pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and burkholderia cepacia under anaerobic planktonic and biofilm conditions.
a hallmark of airways in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) is highly refractory, chronic infections by several opportunistic bacterial pathogens. a recent study demonstrated that acidified sodium nitrite (a-no(2)(-)) killed the highly refractory mucoid form of pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen that significantly compromises lung function in cf patients (s. s. yoon et al., j. clin. invest. 116:436-446, 2006). therefore, the microbicidal activity of a-no(2)(-) (ph 6.5) against the following three major cf pathogens was assessed: p. aeruginosa (a mucoid, muca22 mutant and a sequenced nonmucoid strain, pao1), staphylococcus aureus usa300 (methicillin resistant), and burkholderia cepacia, a notoriously antibiotic-resistant organism. under planktonic, anaerobic conditions, growth of all strains except for p. aeruginosa pao1 was inhibited by 7.24 mm (512 mug ml(-1) no(2)(-)). b. cepacia was particularly sensitive to low concentrations of a-no(2)(-) (1.81 mm) under planktonic conditions. in antibiotic-resistant communities known as biofilms, which are reminiscent of end-stage cf airway disease, a-no(2)(-) killed mucoid p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and b. cepacia; 1 to 2 logs of cells were killed after a 2-day incubation with a single dose of approximately 15 mm a-no(2)(-). animal toxicology and phase i human trials indicate that these bactericidal levels of a-no(2)(-) can be easily attained by aerosolization. thus, in summary, we demonstrate that a-no(2)(-) is very effective at killing these important cf pathogens and could be effective in other infectious settings, particularly under anaerobic conditions where bacterial defenses against the reduction product of a-no(2)(-), nitric oxide (no), are dramatically reduced.
spectral, thermal and in vitro antimicrobial studies of cyclohexylamine-n-dithiocarbamate transition metal complexes.
transition metal complexes of the type [m(l)(2)] and those containing monodentate phosphines of the type [m(l)(2)(pph(3))] {m=ni, co, cu and zn; l=cyclohexylamine-n-dithiocarbamate; pph(3)=triphenylphosphine} have been synthesized. the complexes were characterized using ir, uv-vis, nmr spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (tga). the (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr and (31)p nmr showed the expected signals for the dithiocarbamate and triphenylphosphine moieties. the spectral studies in all compounds revealed that the coordination of metals occurs via the sulphur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand in a bidentate fashion. thermal behavior of the complexes showed that the complexes were more stable than their parent ligands. the ligand moiety is lost in the first step and the rest of the organic moiety decomposes in the subsequent steps. furthermore, the ligand and their metal complexes were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus and antifungal activities against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus carbonarius, aspergillus niger and aspergillus fumigatus. the metal complexes exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the parent ligands. generally, the zinc complexes were effective against the growth of bacteria with zn(l)(2) displaying broad spectrum bacteriocidal activity at concentrations of 50microg/ml; and ni(l)(2) was more effective against the growth of fungi at concentrations of 100-400microg/ml under laboratory conditions.
modifications on amphiphilicity and cationicity of unnatural amino acid containing peptides for the improvement of antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria.
the widespread natural sources-derived cationic peptides have been reported to reveal bacterial killing and/or growth-inhibiting properties. correspondingly, a number of artificial peptides have been designed to understand antibacterial mechanism of the cationic peptides. these peptides are expected to be an alternative antibiotic against drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria because major antimicrobial mechanism of cationic peptides involves bacterial membrane disorder, although those availabilities have not been well evaluated. in this study, cationic peptides containing aib were prepared to evaluate the availability as an antimicrobial agent, especially against representative pathogenic bacteria. among them, brba20, consisting of five repeated aib-arg-aib-ala sequences, showed strong antibacterial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. additionally, growth of serratia marcescens and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, known as proteases-secreting pathogenic bacteria, were also completely inhibited by brba20 under 20 microg/ml peptide concentrations. our results suggested availabilities of aib-derived amphiphilicity and protease resistance in the design of artificial antimicrobial peptides. comparing brba20 with bkba20, it was also concluded that arg residue is the preferred cationic source than lys for antimicrobial action of amphiphilic helices.
in vitro microbial inhibition and cellular response to novel biodegradable composite wound dressings with controlled release of antibiotics.
about 70% of all people with severe burns die from related infections, despite advances in treatment regimens and the best efforts of nurses and doctors. although silver-eluting wound dressings are available for addressing this problem, there is growing evidence of the deleterious effects of such dressings in delaying the healing process owing to cellular toxicity. a new concept of antibiotic-eluting composite wound dressings is described here. these dressings are based on a polyglyconate mesh coated with a porous poly-(dl-lactic-co-glycolic acid) matrix loaded with antibiotic drugs. the effect of antibiotic release on bacterial inhibition was studied, and cell cytotoxicity was examined. the dressings resulted in a 99.99% decrease in the viable counts of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus albus at very high initial inoculations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu ml(-)(1) after only 1 day, while such a decrease in staphylococcus aureus was obtained within 3 days. bacterial inhibition zones around the dressing material were found to persist for 2 weeks, indicating a long-lasting antimicrobial effect. despite severe toxicity to bacteria, the dressing material was found to have no toxic effect on cultured fibroblasts, indicating that the new antibiotic-eluting wound dressings represent an effective option for selective treatment of bacterial infections.

background: current strategies to overcome the global problem of antimicrobial resistance include research in finding new and innovative antimicrobials from plants. this study was carried out to determine the antibacterial activity of plant extracts of olea africana stem-bark, psidium guajava leaves, vernonia amygdalina leaves, lantana camara leaves and mangifera indica leaves which are used in folklore medicine to treat infections of microbial origin in longisa region of bomet district, kenya. methods: methanol extracts were derived and screened. standard cultures of escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 were used in the study. the antibacterial tests used were the agar well diffusion assays at concentration 1 gm/ml. minimum inhibition concentration (mic) was determined in the plant extract that showed some efficacy against the tested microorganisms. gentamicin (10 microg) was used as a positive control. results: the methanol extracts showed weak antibacterial activity against the study organisms compared to gentamicin. all extracts exhibited a significant bactericidal activity against s. aureus while l. camara and v. amygdalina lacked efficacy against p.aeruginosa and e. coli. o. africana and p. guajava presented the lowest mic against s.aureus (62.5 mg/ml and 250 mg/ml respectively p. guajava and m. indica showed analogous mics against p.aeruginosa (250 mg/ml). p. guajava exhibited a better mic against e.coli (500 mg/ml). conclusions: this in-vitro study corroborated the antimicrobial activity of the selected plants used in folklore medicine. the plants could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agent.
evaluation of the burn healing properties of oil extraction from housefly larva in mice.
aim of the study: to evaluate the burn wound-healing properties of oil extraction from housefly larva by employing a deep second-degree model in mice. materials and methods: the burn wound-healing properties were evaluated by employing a deep second-degree model of burn wound assay. the anti-inflammatory activity and antibacterial activity were examined by employing the xylene-induced ear swelling model in mice and a disc-diffusion assay, respectively. results: the best wound-healing activity was observed with the oil extract of housefly larva, followed by ching wan hung and the least active was that of saline solution. the oil extraction from housefly larva suppressed xylene-induced ear swelling in mice with 35.3% of the inhibition rate at the dose of 0.1 ml/30 g. the disc-diffusion assay of housefly larva oil showed positive effect to pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, exhibiting no antibacterial activity to escherichia coli. conclusion: the study provides useful information that the housefly larva oil could be used as a natural ointment to heal the burn wound.
c-terminal peptides of tissue factor pathway inhibitor are novel host defense molecules.
tissue factor pathway inhibitor (tfpi) inhibits tissue factor-induced coagulation, but may, via its c terminus, also modulate cell surface, heparin, and lipopolysaccharide interactions as well as participate in growth inhibition. here we show that c-terminal tfpi peptide sequences are antimicrobial against the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, as well as the fungi candida albicans and candida parapsilosis. fluorescence studies of peptide-treated bacteria, paired with analysis of peptide effects on liposomes, showed that the peptides exerted membrane-breaking effects similar to those seen for the "classic" human antimicrobial peptide ll-37. the killing of e. coli, but not p. aeruginosa, by the c-terminal peptide ggliktkrkrkkqrvkiayeeifvknm (ggl27), was enhanced in human plasma and largely abolished in heat-inactivated plasma, a phenomenon linked to generation of antimicrobial c3a and activation of the classic pathway of complement activation. furthermore, ggl27 displayed anti-endotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model of lps shock. importantly, tfpi was found to be expressed in the basal layers of normal epidermis, and was markedly up-regulated in acute skin wounds as well as wound edges of chronic leg ulcers. furthermore, c-terminal fragments of tfpi were associated with bacteria present in human chronic leg ulcers. these findings suggest a new role for tfpi in cutaneous defense against infections.
a study of cytotoxicity of novel chlorokojic acid derivatives with their antimicrobial and antiviral activities.
a series of 6-chloromethyl-3-hydroxy-2-substituted 4h-pyran-4-one derivatives were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial and antiviral activities. mannich base derivatives were prepared through the reaction of substituted piperazine or piperidine derivatives on chlorokojic acid and formaline. the structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by ir, (1)h and (13)c nmr, esi-ms, and elemental analysis. according to the activity studies, compounds 2-7 (mic: 1-2 microg/ml) were found to be highly active against bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, while compounds 3, 5 and 6 showed significant activity against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii. also, compounds 2-7 were more remarkably active against candida albicans and candida parapsilosis (mic: 4-8 microg/ml). additionally, compound 2 was the most active one against rna virus pi-3.
antimicrobial activity of soy edible films incorporated with thyme and oregano essential oils on fresh ground beef patties.
antibacterial activity of soy protein edible films (spef) incorporated with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% oregano (or) or thyme (th) essential oils was evaluated against escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and lactobacillus plantarum by the inhibition zone test. effects of spef containing 5% or and th or a mixture of or+th (ort) were also tested on fresh ground beef during refrigerated storage (at 4 degrees c). or and th incorporated spef exhibited similar antibacterial activity against all bacteria in inhibition zone test. while e. coli, e. coli o157:h7 and s. aureus were significantly inhibited by antimicrobial films, l. plantarum and p. aeruginosa appeared to be the more resistant bacteria. spef with or, ort, and th did not have significant effects on total viable counts, lactic acid bacteria and staphylococcus spp. when applied on ground beef patties whereas reductions (p<0.05) in coliform and pseudomonas spp. counts were observed.
chemical composition of the sfe-co extracts from cajanus cajan (l.) huth and their antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo.
the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of sfe-co(2)(supercritical fluid extraction) extracts and ethanol extracts from cajanus cajan (l.) huth were investigated. the flavonoid compounds orientin, vitexin, isovitexin, pinostrobin and the stilbene cajaninstilbene acid were detected in sfe-co(2) extracts by hplc-dad. in vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts were evaluated against eight microbial strains (the bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli; and the fungi aspergillus niger and candida albicans). a marked inhibitory effect of the sfe extracts was observed against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis. the ic(50) of sfe-co(2) extracts ranged from 0.0557 mg/ml to 0.0689 mg/ml consisting of cancer (mcf-7 (0.0557 mg/ml)) as well as non-cancer (bhk-21 (0.0641 mg/ml), raw264.7 (0.0689 mg/ml) and vero (0.0625 mg/ml)) cells. flow cytometry (fcm) was used to analyze death rate of the most sensitive strain (staphylococcus aureus) caused by the sfe extracts. additionally, the whole cell proteins of staphylococcus aureus were analyzed by sds-page to detect if there were changes in protein patterns. in vivo antimicrobial activity was studies in mice that had been inoculated with staphylococcus aureus. the potential mechanism of antimicrobial activity in vivo was studied by histopathology.
[evolution of resistance to antibiotics from 1997 to 2005 in the reunion island].
objective: the groupe hospitalier sud reunion (ghsr) is a 1130-bed hospital center, located on the reunion island, (indian ocean). we studied the profiles of antibiotic resistance in 2005, and compared those with previous data collected in 1997-1998, and with metropolitan france and european data. material and methodology: all bacteriological strains isolated from diagnostic samples in 2005 were analyzed according to ca-sfm recommendations. results: since 1997, the rates of resistance to enterobacteria (betalactam, aminoside, quinolone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ticarcillin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin), acinetobacter baumanii (amikacin) has decreased significantly. the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (1997: 3.6 %, 2005: 13.4 %) has increased but less than in metropolitan france. the rate of streptococcuspneumonia with decreased susceptibility to penicillin has increased (1997: 25.5 %, 2005: 42.9 %), as for haemophilusinfluenzae which present an important increase of betalactam resistance (1997: 15.5 %, 2005: 37.8 %). conclusion: by comparing our data to 1997 and metropolitan french data, it seems that the ghsr has managed to protect its hospital-based microbial ecology. however, community germs showed increasing resistance, probably because of an increasing antibiotic pressure, but with resistance rates often inferior to metropolitan french ones.
antimicrobial susceptibility testing of newer quinolones against gram positive and gram negative clinical isolates.
antibiotic resistance development is an ongoing process associated with irrational antibiotic use. who recommends regular surveillance programs for monitoring of antibiotic resistance. the present study is a step in this direction. a total of 124 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from different hospitals in karachi. in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility studies were carried out by agar dilution method using newer quinolones that included gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. it was observed that 50% (n=30) isolates of staphylococcus aureus were resistant to gatifloxacin. gatifloxacin was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=23) and showing complete susceptibility with mic 1mg/l except for three very resistant strains that shown resistance at even higher concentrations. escherichia coli (n=45) has shown 15.5% and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=26) 34.61% resistance to gatifloxacin. levofloxacin was more active against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli showing complete susceptibility at 0.5 mg /l concentration. pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae were found to be resistant to levofloxacin showing 36.36% and 23.08% resistance respectively. the study strongly recommends the adherence to the antibiotic policy and regular susceptibility testing to overcome the problem associated with antimicrobial resistance.
the cyclotide cycloviolacin o2 from viola odorata has potent bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria.
objectives: to determine the antibacterial activity of small cyclic plant proteins, i.e. cyclotides, and the importance of the surface exposed charged residues for activity. methods: prototypic cyclotides, including the mobius kalata b1 and the bracelet cycloviolacin o2 (cyo2), were isolated using reversed-phase hplc. initial activity screenings were conducted using radial diffusion assays (rdas) and mic assays with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus as test strains. for the most active peptide, cyo2, time-kill kinetics was determined in sodium phosphate buffer (containing 0.03% trypticase soy broth) against several gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species. charged residues in cyo2 were chemically modified and activity was determined in time-kill assays. results: cyo2 was the most active cyclotide and efficiently inhibited the growth of s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 and e. coli in rdas and mic assays, while the other peptides were less active. in time-kill assays, cyo2 also had bactericidal activity against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in contrast, none of the cyclotides had high activity against s. aureus. chemical masking of the charged glu and lys residues in cyo2 caused a near total loss of activity against salmonella, while masking arg caused a less pronounced activity reduction. conclusions: cyo2 is a cyclotide with potent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the charged residues in cyo2 are all required for optimum antibacterial activity. in combination with its previously demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and the general stability of cyclotides, cyo2 provides a promising scaffold for future drug design.
simple, effective and affordable approach for the treatment of burns infections.
objective: the aim of the present study was to develop a simple and effective treatment modality using citric acid as a sole antimicrobial agent to control infections in burns patients not responding to conventional treatment. methods: forty-six cases with 5-60% superficial to deep burns in a study group and 20 cases with 10-70% superficial to deep burns in a control group were investigated for culture and susceptibility. the isolates in study group were further tested for susceptibility to citric acid. three percent citric acid gel was applied to burns wounds in study group; however, the control group received conventional antibiotic therapy and local wound care. results: in the control group, pseudomonas aeruginosa (44.44%) and staphylococcus aureus (33.33%) were found to be the commonest bacterial isolates and, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (40.74%) were found to be most effective antibacterial agents. in study group, p. aeruginosa (30.48%) and s. aureus (23.17%) were found to be the commonest bacterial isolates. ceftazidime (52.43%), ciprofloxacin (47.56%) and amikacin (46.34%) were found to be most effective antibacterial agents. application of citric acid to burn wounds resulted in complete healing in 40 (86.95%) cases in 7-25 applications (p value 0.145); however, in a control group conventional antibiotic therapy and local wound care resulted in complete healing in nine (45%) patients only. conclusions: citric acid treatment was found effective in the control of burns infections as compared to conventional therapy. complete healing in 86.95% cases as compared to 45% in a control group indicates that citric acid is nontoxic, economical and quite effective in the management of burns infections.

aims: to determine the antimicrobial potential of prunin (p), a flavanone glucoside resulting from the hydrolysis of naringin present in grapefruit, and of its prunin 6''-o-lauroyl ester (pl), synthesized by enzymatic catalysis. methods and results: p and its lauroyl ester were tested against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and moulds. p showed no inhibitory effect against the micro-organisms assayed, but stimulated growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa and different bacilllus sp. however, 150 mug ml(-1) of pl inhibited escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, many bacillus sp., staphylococcus aureus atcc29213, enterococcus avium dsmz17511, and different listeria monocytogenes strains. in the last case, l. monocytogenes, sensitive or bacteriocin-resistant cells, lost nearly 4-log reductions after 30 min of contact. a bactericidal mode of action was determined using both scanning and transmission electronic microscopies. conclusions: pl could be used as a food additive, because at low concentration (150 mug ml(-1)) it exhibited antimicrobial activity against important food-borne pathogens. a bactericidal effect was also determined on l. monocytogenes sensitive and bacteriocin-resistant mutant strains. p did not show any antimicrobial property at all. significance and impact of the study: pl is a potential antimicrobial compound with a high anti-listeria property.
implementation of a hospital-wide project for appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis.
the aim of this study was to confirm the effect of implementing a hospital-wide project for appropriate use of antimicrobial prophylaxis (amp) to reduce the rate of antibiotic-resistant organisms. fifteen different manuals for each surgical department have been simultaneously implemented since february 2007. compliance rate was compared between pre- and postintervention periods (3 months for each period). as an effect of this intervention, we analyzed changes in the rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus among organisms isolated postoperatively. the number of operations was 1,627 in both periods. among patients whose surgeries were longer than 3 h in duration, 75% received an additional intraoperative antimicrobial dose in the postintervention period and 23% in the preintervention period (p < 0.001). although most patients received postoperative amp with an interval of q12 h in the preintervention period, 63% of the patients received amp with an interval of q8 h in the postintervention period. the duration of amp use was reduced from 2.4 +/- 1.9 to 1.6 +/- 1.5 days (p < 0.001). forty-seven percent of patients discontinued amp within 24 h and 81% within 48 h. isolation rates of p. aeruginosa among all gram-negative organisms significantly decreased from 13% (68/538 patients) to 7.3% (37/509 patients) (p = 0.004). execution of a hospital-wide project to promote the appropriate use of amp, including shortening the duration of amp use, was useful to decrease the rate of p. aeruginosa isolated postoperatively.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of n,n'-bis(2-hydroxylbenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine derivatives.
a series of n,n'-bis(2-hydroxylbenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine derivatives and its schiff bases were synthesized, characterized and screened for in vitro antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica. result indicated that the ethylenediamine derivatives, n,n'-bis(2-hydroxy-5-bromobenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (21), and n,n'-bis(2-hydroxy-5-chlorobenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (22) showed the most favorable antimicrobial activity exhibiting lc(50) of 11.6 and 8.79 mum against s.enterica, 86 and 138 mum against p. aeruginosa, and 140 and 287 mum against s. aureus, respectively. these compounds displayed highest level of resistance with s. aureus. thus, the high level of activity seen with the compounds (21, 22) suggests that these compounds could serve as the leads for development of novel synthetic compounds with enhanced antimicrobial activity.
activity of topical antimicrobial agents against multidrug-resistant bacteria recovered from burn patients.
background: topical antimicrobials are employed for prophylaxis and treatment of  burn wound infections despite no established susceptibility breakpoints, which are becoming vital in an era of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria. we compared two methods of determining topical antimicrobial susceptibilities. methods: isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter baumanii-calcoaceticus (abc) from burn patients were tested using broth microdilution and agar well diffusion to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and zones of inhibition (zi). isolates had systemic antibiotic resistance and clonality determined. mdr included resistance to antibiotics in three or more classes. results: we assessed 22 esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, 20 abc (75% mdr), 20 p. aeruginosa (45% mdr), and 20 mrsa isolates. the most active agents were mupirocin for mrsa and mafenide acetate for the gram-negatives with moderate mics/zi found with silver sulfadiazene, silver nitrate, and honey. mdr and non-mdr isolates had similar topical resistance. there was no clonality associated with resistance patterns. conclusion: despite several methods to test bacteria for topical susceptibility, no defined breakpoints exist and standards need to be established. we recommend continuing to use silver products for prophylaxis against gram-negatives and mafenide acetate for treatment, and mupirocin for mrsa.
new quinoline derivatives: synthesis and investigation of antibacterial and antituberculosis properties.
four new series of quinoline derivatives were synthesized starting from 2-trifluoromethyl aniline through multi-step reactions. in the reaction sequence, substituted aniline was cyclized to 4-hydroxy quinoline 1, which was then transformed to 4-chloro-2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline 2. the key scaffold 4-hydrazinyl-2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline 3, obtained from the compound 2, was successfully converted to target quinoline derivatives, viz. hydrazones 4a-t, ureas 5a-e, thioureas 6a-c and pyrazoles 7a-d, in good yields. the newly synthesized title compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae (recultured) and antituberculosis activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h(37)rv and mdr-tb. preliminary results indicated that most of the hydrazone derivatives demonstrated very good antibacterial and antituberculosis activities while other derivatives showed moderate activity.
[secondary metabolites, lethality and antimicrobial activity of extracts from three corals and three marine mollusks from sucre, venezuela].
the study of biochemical activity of extracts obtained from marine organisms is gaining interest as some have proved to have efficient health or industrial applications. to evaluate lethality and antimicrobial activities, some chemical tests were performed on crude extracts of the octocorals eunicea sp., muricea sp. and pseudopterogorgia acerosa and the mollusks pteria colymbus, phyllonotus pomum and chicoreus brevifrons, collected in venezuelan waters. the presence of secondary metabolites like alkaloids, unsaturated sterols and pentacyclic triterpenes in all invertebrates, was evidenced. additionally, sesquiterpenlactones, saponins, tannins, cyanogenic and cardiotonic glycosides were also detected in some octocoral extracts, suggesting that biosynthesis of these metabolites is typical in this group. from the lethality bioassays, all extracts resulted lethal to artemia salina (lc50<1000 microg/ml) with an increased of lethal activity with exposition time. p. pomum extract showed the highest lethality rate (lc50=46.8 microg/ml). compared to the octocorals, mollusks extracts displayed more activity and a greater action spectrum against different bacterial strains, whereas octocorals also inhibited some fungi strains growth. staphylococcus aureus was the most susceptible to the antimicrobial power of the extracts (66.7%), whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and aspergillus niger were not affected. the antibiosis shown by marine organisms extracts indicates that some of their biosynthesized metabolites are physiologically active, and may have possible cytotoxic potential or as a source of antibiotic components.
the impact of fluoroquinolones use on antibiotic resistance in an intensive care  burn department.
background: fluoroquinolones (fq) use has been identified as a risk factor for colonization and infection to methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus(mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosae multiresistant(pmr) , acinetobacter multiresistant (amr) and multidrug resistant bacteria(mdrb). aim: our study proposes to measure the annual antibiotic use of fq and antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and a. baumannii in an intensive care burn unit. methods: the study was conducted during a 4 year period (1 january 2000 to 31 december 2003). antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method as recommended by the french society of microbiology. the consumption of the following antibiotics: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin was expressed as the antimicrobial use density (ad) taking into account the quantity of antibiotics in grams converted to defined daily doses (ddd) and the number of day hospitalization. statistical significance was defined as p value < 0.05 for the corresponding correlation coefficient. results: there were statistically significant relationship between use of ciprofloxacin and resistance in p. aeruginosa to this drug (rs=0.95, p<0.05). moreover, the ciprofloxacin consumption was correlated with resistance to imipenem (rs=0.95, p<0.05) and ceftazidime (rs=0.95, p<0.05) in p. aeruginosa . a restriction use of ciprofloxacin has been taken during 2003, it is followed by a significant decrease of resistance to imipenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin in p. aeruginosa (p<0, 05). the use of fluoroquinolones was correlated significantly with mrsa (rs=0.96, p<0.05) . the restriction use of fq was significantly associated with a decrease of mrsa. the consumption of ciprofloxacin was also correlated (p<0.05) with resistance of ceftazidime in k. pneumoniae. however, there is not a correlation (p> 0.05) between fluoroquinolones use and resistance in a. baumannii as well in ciprofloxacin, imipenem and ceftazidime. our study illustrates the pressure of selection of fluoroquinolones use in the development of mdrb. the use and or the duration of treatment with theses antibiotics should be rationalised as part of efforts to control the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria.
development of an oregano-based ointment with anti-microbial activity including activity against methicillin-resistant staphlococcus aureus.
increasing antibiotic resistance has prompted a search for new compounds with anti-microbial activity. in the authors' previous study, oregano extract was identified as one of the most potent anti-microbial compounds. the disk diffusion method was employed to assess the degree of inhibition against various microorganisms, and the bacteriostatic or bactericidal mechanism of action. disk diffusion studies showed that oregano was found to be bacteriostatic for staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, (mrsa) but bacteriocidal for seven other microorganisms. pseudomonas aeruginosa could not be inhibited by oregano. an ointment consisting of 1-10% oregano could inhibit most organisms except for proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris, which required 20% and pseudomonas which could not be inhibited even at the highest concentration of 80%. oregano extracts can be formulated into an ointment that shows broad antimicrobial activity. additional testing to assess tissue toxicity and other adverse reactions would be needed prior to human testing.
antibiotic pigment from desert soil actinomycetes; biological activity, purification and chemical screening.
an actinomycete strain, streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. ossamyceticus (strain d10) was isolated from thar desert soil, rajasthan during the year 2006 and found to produce a yellow color pigment with antibiotic activity. crude pigment was produced from strain d10 by solid state fermentation using wheat bran medium followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. the antimicrobial activity of the crude pigment was evaluated against drug resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing cultures of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella sp. about 420 mg of crude pigment was produced per 10 g of wheat bran medium. in the disc diffusion method the crude ethyl acetate extract showed a minimum of 10 mm inhibition against klebsiella sp. and maximum of 19 mm of inhibition against escherichia coli. the crude pigment was partially purified using thin layer chromatography with the solvent system chloroform:methanol (30:70) and the rf value was calculated as 0.768. antimicrobial activity of the partially purified compound from thin layer chromatography was determined using the bioautography method. the purified pigment showed minimum of 15 mm inhibition against klebsiella sp. and a maximum of 23 mm of inhibition against vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in the disc diffusion method. based on the results of chemical screening, the pigment was tentatively identified as group of sugar containing molecules.
bactericidal effects of silver plus titanium dioxide-coated endotracheal tubes on pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.
purpose: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a nosocomial infection resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) are pathogens associated with vap. silver (ag) coating of endotracheal tubes (etts) reduces bacterial colonization, however titanium dioxide (tio(2)) coating has not been studied. methods: five types of ett coatings were applied over silica layer: ag, solgel tio(2), solgel tio(2) with ag, degussa p25 tio(2) (degussa tio(2)), and degussa tio(2) with ag. after etts were incubated with p. aeruginosa or s. aureus; colonization was determined quantitatively. results: pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus grew for 5 days on standard etts. compared to standard etts, p. aeruginosa growth was significantly inhibited by solgel tio(2) with ag at 24 hours, and by degussa tio(2) with ag at 24 and 48 hours after inoculation. no significant difference in s. aureus growth was observed between the control and any of the five coatings for 5 days. conclusion: in vitro, solgel tio(2) with ag and degussa tio(2) with ag both attenuated p. aeruginosa growth, but demonstrated no effect on s. aureus colonization. further studies using alternative coating and incorporating uv light exposure are needed to identify their potential utility in reducing vap.
antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.
gc-ms analysis, antibacterial activity and genotoxic property of erigeron mucronatus essential oil.
gc-ms analysis of the hydrodistilled oil of erigeron mucronatus dc was carried out, after the separation of a crystalline compound, lachnophyllum cumulene. twenty-four components were identified. the oil contained 59.6% sesquiterpenoids, 16.1% monoterpenoids and 24.3% poly-acetylenic esters. among the mono and sesquiterpenoids, limonene (10.3%) and caryophyllenes (11.4%) were the major constituents. the essential oil also revealed the unusual presence of both cis (8.3%) and trans (1.1%) methyl lachnophyllum esters. seasonal variation in the yield of e. mucronatus oil was observed. the yield varied from 0.49 to 0.58%, being highest during the rainy season. antimicrobial activity was assessed using a method based on zones of inhibition; the oil exhibited maximum anti- bacterial activity against both staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, but moderate activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. genotoxicity of the oil was determined in ab blood serum at different concentrations and hours of exposure. the antibacterial activity of the oil and its insignificant genotoxicity at low concentrations make the oil a good candidate as a curative agent.
antimicrobial effect of photodynamic therapy using a highly pure chlorin e6.
the aim of the present study is to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of photodynamic therapy (pdt) using a highly pure chlorin e(6) (ce(6)), against various pathogenic bacteria. to examine the antimicrobial effect of ce(6)-mediated pdt against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, inhibition zone formation, cfu quantification, and bacterial viability were evaluated. inhibition zone analysis showed that ce(6)-mediated pdt is very effective to inhibit the growth of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, but has only minor effect to e. coli and s. typhimurium, which was dependent on the energy density of laser and dose of ce(6). ce(6)-mediated pdt also nearly inhibited the colony formation of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, and partially inhibited that of e. coli and s. typhimurium. in addition, the number of viable bacteria decreased greatly after pdt application with ls-chlorin e6 of 10 microm and laser and energy density of 20 j/cm(2). these results show that ce(6)-mediated pdt can be an effective alternative for antimicrobial treatment.
the global problem of antibiotic resistance.
amid the recent attention justly focused on the potential problem of microbial sources for weapons of bioterrorism, it is also apparent that human pathogens frequently isolated from infections in patients from community and hospital sources have been growing more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. much of the growth of multiple-drug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens can be contributed to the overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobial products. however, an equally troubling and often overlooked component of the problem involves the elegant ways in which pathogenic bacteria continually evolve complex genetic systems for acquiring and regulating an endless array of antibiotic-resistance mechanisms. efforts to develop new antimicrobials have over the past two decades been woefully behind the rapid evolution of resistance genes developing among both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. several new agents that are best suited for use in the hospital environment have been developed to combat staphylococci resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobials following acquisition of the meca gene. however, the dramatic spread in the us of the now common community strain of staphylococcus aureus usa300 has shifted the therapeutic need for new antibiotics useful against mrsa to the community. as the pharmaceutical industry focused on discovering new agents for use against mrsa, hospitals in many parts of the world have seen the emergence of gram-negative pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae that are clinically resistant to almost all available antimicrobials. such mdr isolates usually contain multiple-resistance determinants, including loss of outer membrane porins via gene inactivation by chromosomally encoded insertion sequences, up-regulation of inate efflux pumps, as well as acquisition of drug-inactivating enzymes whose genes are encoded on self-transmissible plasmids, integrons, and complex transposable elements. these determinants confer a complex resistance phenotype that is often superimposed on mutations in the primary drug target in the cell. the continued evolution of such a complex array of antibiotic-resistance genes presents a formidable challenge at a time when large pharmaceutical companies have scaled down their presence in the anti-infectives arena.
metal based biologically active compounds: design, synthesis, and antibacterial/antifungal/cytotoxic properties of triazole-derived schiff bases and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes.
a new series of oxovanadium(iv) complexes have been designed and synthesized with a new class of triazole schiff bases derived from the reaction of 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole with 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde, pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde and acetyl pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde, respectively. physical (magnetic susceptibility, molar conductance), spectral (ir, (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr, mass and electronic) and analytical data have established the structures of these synthesized schiff bases and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes. the schiff bases, predominantly act as bidentate and coordinate with the vanadium(iv) metal to give a stoichiometric ratio of 1:2 [m:l], forming a general formulae, [m(l-h)(2)] and [m(l)(2)]so(4) where l = (l(1))-(l(4)) and m = vo(iv) of these complexes in a square-pyramidal geometry. in order to evaluate the biological activity of schiff bases and to assess the role of vanadium(iv) metal on biological activity, the triazole schiff bases and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes have been studied for in vitro antibacterial activity against four gram-negative (escherichia coli, shigella flexenari, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi) and two gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis) bacterial strains, in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifucus, candida albican, aspergillus flavus, microscopum canis, fusarium solani and candida glaberata. the simple schiff bases showed weaker to significant activity against one or more bacterial and fungal strains. in most of the cases higher activity was exhibited upon coordination with vanadium(iv) metal. brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out for in vitro cytotoxic properties against artemia salina.
azinyl sulfides--cxviii. antimicrobial activity of novel 1-methyl-3-thio-4-aminoquinolinium salts.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel 1-methyl-3-alkylthio-4-aminoquinolinium salts 2 and 1-methyl-3-acylthio-4-aminoquinolinium salts 4 are described. compounds 2 were obtained by reacting 1-methyl-3,4-(dimethylthio)quinolinium chloride 1 with amines and by reacting 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium-3-thiolates 3 with alkylating agents. compounds 4 were obtained by the reaction of 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium-3-thiolates 3 with acylating agents. antimicrobial activity of compounds 2 and 4 was determined using g+ (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and g(-) (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains as well as candida albicans yeast. the compounds show greatest activity against s. aureus whereas the lowest against p. aeruginosa.
essential oil from the underground parts of laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
the composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of laserpitium zernyi hayek (apiaceae) were investigated. the pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by gc and gc-ms. forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). the main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. the antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against gram (+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis), gram (-) bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (candida albicans). l. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against s. epidermidis, s. aureus and m. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
antibacterial activity of guanidinylated neomycin b- and kanamycin a-derived amphiphilic lipid conjugates.
objectives: neomycin b exhibits poor antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa, while kanamycin a shows weak activity against mrsa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) and p. aeruginosa. the main purpose of this work was to study whether lipid conjugation of guanidinylated neomycin b- and kanamycin a-derived cationic headgroups could restore antibacterial activity against neomycin b- and kanamycin a-resistant strains, while retaining antibacterial activity against non-resistant strains. methods: seven polyguanidinylated neomycin b-lipids differing in the nature of the lipid tail and two cationic kanamycin a-lipids were prepared, and their in vitro activity was assessed against a variety of neomycin b- and kanamycin a-resistant and neomycin b- and kanamycin a-non-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative strains. results: conjugation of neomycin b- and kanamycin a-derived polyamine or polyguanidinylated headgroups to hydrophobic c16 or c20 lipid tails restored the anti-mrsa activity of both aminoglycosides and the anti-mrse activity of kanamycin a. polyguanidinylation of the neomycin b-derived headgroup lowers the hydrophobic requirement of the lipid tail segment to provide broad-spectrum antibacterial activity from c16 to c12. moreover, guanidinylation of the polycationic headgroup in neomycin b-derived cationic lipids enhances antibacterial activity against a neomycin b-, kanamycin a- and gentamicin-resistant p. aeruginosa strain, and reduces haemolytic activity. conclusions: these findings suggest that lipid conjugation of neomycin b- and kanamycin a-derived cationic lipids provides a general tool to enhance the antibacterial activity of these two aminoglycosides against resistant strains.
microwave assisted synthesis of some novel 2-pyrazoline derivatives as possible antimicrobial agents.
some new [3-(4-phenyl)-5-phenyl-4,5-dihydropyrazol-1-yl](pyridine-4-yl)methanones and 3-substituted phenyl-5-substituted phenyl-4,5-dihydro-pyrazole-1-carbothioamides have been synthesized employing microwave techniques and evaluated for antimicrobial activity. substituted acetophenones (1) were reacted with appropriately substituted benzaldehydes (2) in the presence of ethanol to furnish substituted chalcones (3a-f). these chalcones were further treated with isonicotinic acid hydrazide (inh) to afford substituted [3-(4-phenyl)-5-phenyl-4,5-dihydropyrazol-1-yl](pyridine-4-yl)methanones (4a-f). reaction of these chalcones with thiosemicarbazide yielded substituted 3,5-diphenyl-4,5-dihydro-1h-pyrazole-1-carbothioamides (5a-f). the structures of newly synthesized compounds (4a-f) and (5a-f) have been confirmed by suitable spectroscopic techniques such as ir and 1h nmr. all the compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and for antifungal activity against candida albicans and aspergillus niger the compounds exhibited moderate antibacterial and good antifungal activities. compound 4b and 4d showed significant antifungal activity against a. niger and c. albicans, respectively.
management of antibiotic resistance in the intensive care unit setting.
over the past few decades, an alarming increase of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus species, carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., and multidrug-resistant acinetobacter spp., has been observed, particularly in intensive care units. for clinicians, the rising resistance rate observed in nosocomial pathogens, when coupled with the lack of effective antimicrobials, represents the real challenge in the therapeutic management of critically ill patients. the contribution of clinicians in minimizing the increasing trend of resistance is represented by reduction of the patients' exposure to antibiotics, which reduces the resistance-selecting pressure, and by avoiding unnecessary antibiotic treatments. recent issues on strategies to minimize resistance development and to appropriately manage critically ill patients with infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms in the intensive care unit setting are discussed in this article.
antibacterial effects of sol-gel-derived bioactive glass nanoparticle on aerobic  bacteria.
the aim of this work was to evaluate the antibacterial effect of bioactive glass  nanopowders. the 58s, 63s, and 72s compositions were prepared via the sol-gel technique. characterization techniques such as x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (tem), zetasizer, and x-ray fluorescent were used. the antibacterial activity was studied using escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, and staphylococcus aureus. cytotoxicity of the samples was evaluated using mouse fibroblast l929 cell line. the chemical compositions of the prepared samples were as predicted, and the particle size of the samples with an amorphous structure mainly ranged over 20-90 nm. at broth concentrations below 50 mg/ml, they showed no antibacterial activity. the 58s showed the highest antibacterial activity with the minimum bactericidal concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/ml for e. coli plus s. aureus and for p. aeruginosa, respectively. the 63s exhibited bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects on e. coli and s. aureus at concentrations of 100 and 50 mg/ml, respectively, at an minimum bactericidal concentrations of 100 mg/ml. however, 72s bioactive glass nanopowder showed no antibacterial effect. they showed no cytotoxicity. it was concluded that bioactive glass nanopowders could be considered as good candidates for the treatment of oral bone defects and root canal disinfection.

effects of biofilm treatments on the multi-species lubbock chronic wound biofilm  model.
objective: to evaluate the efficacy of several biofilm effectors in inhibiting biofilm formation in an in vitro multi-species chronic wound biofilm model. method: the lubbock chronic wound biofilm (lcwb) model has been described in detail elsewhere. pathogens used in the model are pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. these are three of the most important species associated with biofilms. here, the model was exposed to the following biofilm effectors: xylitol, salicylic acid, farnesol, erythritol and two proprietary, semi-solid, wound-dressing formulations currently under development (sanguitec gels). results: biofilm formation was completely inhibited in the lcwb model following treatment with 20% xylitol, 10% erythritol, 1,000 microg/ml farnesol, 20mm salicylic acid or 0.1% of either of the two sanguitec gel formulations. salicylic acid specifically inhibited s. aureus (p<0.01) at 10mm and 20mm, consequently increasing the ratios of p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis within the biofilm. xylitol had an increasing inhibitory effect on p. aeruginosa (p<0.01) at all concentrations evaluated. erythritol had an inhibitory effect on p. aeruginosa and s. aureus growth (p<0.01) at over 5% concentrations. the inhibitory effect of both sanguitec gel formulations was more broadly effective, with an increasingly inhibitory effect on all lcwb species (p<0.01). conclusion: the lcwb model provides a multi-species format with which to evaluate the effect of biofilm effectors on wound flora in a biofilm phenotype. these results suggest that different treatments can target specific populations within a biofilm. salicylic acid preferentially targeted s. aureus, xylitol preferentially targeted p. aeruginosa, while erythritol preferentially targeted both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. in contrast, the two sanguitec gel formulations provided a broad, less preferential, inhibition of biofilm development. declaration of interest: research and testing laboratory is a for-profit enterprise that develops molecular methods and performs service research work on biofilms. sanguitec gel was developed by jpk and cej.
synthesis and antibacterial activity of 5-ylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidene-4,6-pyrimidinediones.
5-benzylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidenepyrimidine-4,6-diones (compounds 1-9), carrying 2,3,4-trifluoro or 3,4,5-trimethoxy groups on the benzylidene moiety, and rhodanine derivatives 10 and 11 were synthesized and assayed in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against four standard bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853). compounds 1-3 and 9 that were active against s. aureus, were also tested against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) atcc 43300, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619 and streptococcus pyogenes atcc 19615. (z)-5-(2,3,4-trifluorobenzylidene)rhodanine (1) inhibited the growth of s. aureus at 0.5 microg/ml and mrsa at 32 microg/ml. stronger antimicrobial activity against s. aureus was observed for compounds bearing the rhodanine ring than those containing other heterocyclic moieties. neither of the compounds 1-11 inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacteria e. coli or p. aeruginosa.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some pyridinium salts.
some substituted benzylidenehydrazinylpyridinium derivatives bearing benzyl, ethylphenyl and propylphenyl groups on the pyridinium nitrogen were synthesized and screened for possible antibacterial and antifungal activities against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans using the microdilution method. antimicrobial test results indicated that compounds containing a 3-phenylpropyl chain displayed the highest antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus and the compound 3d was the most active in the series against all tested bacteria and fungi strains.
antimicrobial activities of some synthetic butenolides and their pyrrolone derivatives.
in the present investigation, 17 new synthetic butenolides, i.e. 2-arylidene-4-(4-chloro/ethyl-phenyl)but-3-en-4-olides (3-19) have been synthesized from 3-(4-chloro-benzoyl)propionic acid or 3-(4-ethyl-benzoyl)propionic acid using appropriate reagents. some of the selected butenolides were reacted with ammonia and benzylamine to give the corresponding pyrrolones (20-31) and n-benzyl-pyrrolones (32-39) respectively. all the compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against candida albicans, aspergillus niger, and rhizopus oryza. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of the compounds are reported. the pyrrolone derivatives discovered in this study may provide valuable therapeutic intervention for the treatment of microbial diseases, especially against fungal species.
antimicrobial efficacy assessment of multi-use solution to disinfect hydrophilic  contact lens, in vitro.
purpose: to evaluate the efficacy of disinfecting solutions in hydrophilic contact lenses (cl). methods: two multi-use solutions denominated solution a (0.001% polyquaternium-1 and 0.0005% myristamidopropyl dimethylamine) and solution b (0.0001% polyaminopropyl biguanide) were used. the solutions were tested in hydrophilic contact lenses infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc27583), staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc1226), klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc13883), staphylococcus aureus (atcc25923) and candida albicans (atcc 10231) and the decrease in microorganisms growth after the hydrophilic contact lenses were cleaned with the respective solutions was verified. the manufacture's instructions were followed. results: a decrease of 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and a decrease 100% of klebsiella pneumoniae was observed. conclusion: the solutions decreased the amount of microorganisms tested.
composition and biological activity of the essential oil from leaves of plinia cerrocampanensis, a new source of alpha-bisabolol.
the essential oil from fresh leaves of plinia cerrocampanensis barrie (myrtaceae), obtained by hydrodistillation, was analysed by gc-fid and gc-ms. forty components, representing more than 91% of the oil, were identified. oxygenated sesquiterpenes represented the main fraction with alpha-bisabolol (42.8%) as the major constituent, making this plant a new and good source of this substance. biological activity of the essential oil was evaluated against several bacterial and fungal strains as well as larvae from aedes aegypti. the highest activity was found against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, microsporum gypseum, trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum with mic values from 32 to 125 microg/ml. the essential oil also showed potent inhibitory and bactericidal activities against three h. pylori strains, with mic and mbc values of 62.5 microg/ml, and caused 100% mortality of a. aegypti larvae at a concentration of 500 microg/ml.
gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of volatiles obtained by four different techniques from salvia rosifolia sm., and evaluation for biological activity.
four different isolation techniques, conventional hydrodistillation (hd), microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (mwhd), microdistillation (md) and micro-steam distillation-solid-phase microextraction (msd-spme), have been used to analyze the volatile constituents from the aerial parts of salvia rosifolia sm. by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. hd and mwhd techniques produced quantitatively (yield, 0.39% and 0.40%) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar essential oils. alpha-pinene (15.7-34.8%), 1,8-cineole (16.6-25.1%), beta-pinene (6.7-13.5%), beta-caryophyllene (1.4-5.0%) and caryophyllene oxide (1.4-4.4%) were identified as major constituents of this turkish endemic species. besides, the hydrodistilled oil of s. rosifolia was evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. the hydrodistilled oil of s. rosifolia showed antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) with a mic value of 125microg/ml. other human pathogenic microorganisms (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans) were also inhibited within a moderate range (mic=125-1000microg/ml). antifungal activity of the oil was also observed against the strawberry anthracnose-causing fungal plant pathogens colletotrichum acutatum, c. fragariae and c. gloeosporioides. no cytotoxicity was observed for s. rosifolia oil up to 25mg/ml against malignant melanoma, epidermal, ductal and ovary carcinoma.
antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from more than 10,000 patients with infectious respiratory diseases: a 25-year longitudinal study.
the study group on antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from respiratory infections was established in 1981 in japan to elucidate trends in such susceptibilities in patients with infectious respiratory diseases; the group has conducted nationwide research in collaboration with 21 medical institutions. examination of more than 10,000 patients by 2005 allowed a summary of study findings. streptococcus pneumoniae started to become resistant to penicillin g in the 1990s, and the isolation rate of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp + prsp) reached almost 60% in 2001. the proportion of prsp also increased, reaching 19.4%. thereafter, the rate of pisp + prsp decreased somewhat to the mid-30% range. macrolide resistance was also observed; in 2005, the prevalence of strains highly susceptible to erythromycin with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml had decreased to 15.5%, whereas the proportion of highly resistant strains with mics >or= 128 microg/ml exceeded 40%. among staphylococcus aureus isolates, the proportion of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains began to increase rapidly in 1986 and constituted around 60% of all s. aureus strains identified in 1990 and in the following years. in 1993, the prevalence of ampicillin-resistant isolates of haemophilus influenzae had increased remarkably, presumably related to the outbreak of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae strains, and the proportion of these strains among the isolates surpassed 30% in 2002 and thereafter. for klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of first- to fourth-generation cephems improved with each generation. the mic distribution patterns of pseudomonas aeruginosa shifted towards higher mics when compared with the mics for other pathogens. broad patterns with no distinct peaks reflected the difficulty in treating p. aeruginosa infection. regarding moraxella catarrhalis, beta-lactamase-producing strains already constituted a majority of the isolates in 1990, and the proportion of strains highly susceptible to ampicillin, with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml, was less than 10% at that time.
benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors as potential antimicrobial agents with activity against enterococci.
background: antibacterial activity of three members of a benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors ( 4a , 4b and 6 ) was studied on standard strains, and with 4b also on clinical isolates of enterococci. methods: susceptibility to each compound was tested using a broth macrodilution method with a range of dilutions from 0.016 to 128 microg/ml on four standard strains (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) and in the case of 4b also on 52 clinical isolates of enterococci (7 vancomycin-susceptible e. faecalis, 15 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium and 30 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium), and on two additional standard strains (s. aureus atcc 43300 and e. faecalis atcc 51299). results: neither of the compounds inhibited the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 or p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. compound 4b inhibited the growth of s. aureus atcc 29213 at 8 microg/ml, s. aureus atcc 43300 at 32 microg/ml, e. faecalis atcc 29212, and e. faecalis atcc 51299 at 16 microg/ml, while 4a and 6 did so at higher concentrations. for clinical isolates of enterococci, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 4b were in the range of 0.5-16 microg/ml. conclusions: compound 4b promises to be a potentially useful antimicrobial agent for vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci.
antibacterial activity of synthetic fire ant venom: the solenopsins and isosolenopsins.
background: we determined the in vitro activity of 9 synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids (+/-)-solenopsin a, (2r, 6r)-solenopsin a, (2s, 6s)-solenopsin b, (+/-)-isosolenopsin a, (2s, 6r)-isosolenopsin a,(2r, 6s)-isosolenopsin a, (+/-)-isosolenopsin b, (2s, 6r)-isosolenopsin b, and (2r, 6s)-isosolenopsin b against 6 species of bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bacteriocidal concentration were determined in accordance with the clinical laboratory standards institute guidelines. time kill studies used american type culture collection bacterial isolates tested at 5 times the minimum inhibitory concentration. results: none of the venom alkaloids inhibited e. coli or p. aeruginosa, whereas all the alkaloids inhibited s. pneumoniae. only 4 alkaloids inhibited s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and s. maltophilia. time-kill kinetics indicates that all 4 active alkaloids had bactericidal activity. conclusions: specific isomers of synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids have antibacterial activity against human pathogens.
prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria isolated from older versus younger hospitalized adults: results of a two-centre study.
objectives: to compare the proportion of antimicrobial-resistant strains among bacterial isolates from younger and older hospital patients and to quantify changes in the proportion of antimicrobial-resistant strains in both groups over time. patients and methods: a retrospective analysis of microbiology data from two centres in maryland and chicago was performed. adult hospital inpatients with positive clinical cultures for specific antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pathogens between 1999 and 2005 (55 427 isolates) were included. the proportions of isolates not susceptible to specific antimicrobial agents were compared between patients > or =65 and <65 years. additional analyses examined temporal trends in the frequency of resistance and the frequency of resistance among the oldest patients (> or =80 years), in bacteria isolated from blood cultures and in bacteria obtained from intensive care unit patients. results: heterogeneity was observed in the frequency of resistance among different bacteria between older and younger patients, between the two centres and over the study period. staphylococcus aureus isolates were more likely to be resistant to methicillin when obtained from older patients at chicago (50.9% versus 40.9%; p < 0.001). in contrast, younger patients yielded a greater proportion of enterococci resistant to vancomycin at maryland (19.4% versus 16.5%; p = 0.009). results were variable when resistance to fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and imipenem were compared for pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. conclusions: overall, advanced patient age was not uniformly associated with a greater likelihood of antimicrobial resistance among all bacterial pathogens. moreover, the frequency of resistance in older and younger patients varied considerably at the two sites over the study period. variability in the frequency of resistance precludes simplistic conclusions regarding the relationship between age and resistance.
[determination of associated antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a public hospital in goiania, state of goias].
this study evaluated the associated antimicrobial resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus in relation to an antimicrobial agent with other drugs. the associated antimicrobial resistance was calculated by means of the relative risk. there was an obvious relationship between oxacillin resistance and resistance to other antimicrobial agents among isolates of oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (68.5%), greater than 32%, except for linezolid (6.7%). pronounced associated resistance among drugs was observed for pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, particularly for ciprofloxacin and carbapenems (59.6% to 60.7%) and for aminoglycosides and carbapenems (66.3 % to 67.7 %) and other beta-lactam antibiotics (52.3% to 85.8%). the present study emphasizes the importance of diagnostic cultures and susceptibility testing for selecting the correct antimicrobial agent, with regard to the clinical impact of increased multiresistance and selection of associated antimicrobial resistance.
synthesis and in vitro microbiological evaluation of novel 4-aryl-5-isopropoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidinones.
seven 4-aryl-5-isopropoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1h)-ones 4a-g and 4-phenyl-5-isopropoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1h)-thione 4h have been synthesized by a one-pot cyclocondensation of aldehydes, isopropyl acetoacetate and urea/thiourea in ethanol by using strontium chloride hexahydrate as the catalyst. all the compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi and antifungal activity against candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, rhizopus and mucor. compounds 4b, 4c, 4f, 4g exhibited excellent in vitro antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa and potent in vitro antifungal activity against candida albicans, rhizopus and mucor. compound 4f with a nitro group at the para position of the 4-aryl group and 4g with a fluorine at the para position of the 4-aryl group showed more activity than the standard drugs.
non-adherence to guidelines: an avoidable cause of failure of empirical antimicrobial therapy in the presence of difficult-to-treat bacteria.
purpose: to identify the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) due to difficult-to-treat (dtt) bacteria (i.e., pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), and to assess the rate and the causes of inappropriateness of empirical antimicrobial therapy. methods: in an intensive care unit of a university hospital, patients with vap were empirically treated with antibiotics without activity against dtt bacteria if the patients had no prior hospitalization or prior administration of antibiotics, according to local guidelines. results: overall, the empirical antimicrobial therapy was appropriate in 190 (87%) out of 218 patients with vap. fifty (23%) patients developed problems due to dtt bacteria. the risk factors for vap due to dtt bacteria were shock state, prior antimicrobial therapy, prior stay in long-term care facilities and late-onset vap. empirical antimicrobial therapy was inappropriate in 20 (40%) patients with vap due to dtt bacteria and 8 (5%) patients with vap due to non-dtt (p = 0.001). guidelines violations (nine patients), bacteria not included in antibiotic spectrum (eight patients) and bacterial resistance (three patients) were the causes of inappropriateness in case of dtt bacteria. conclusion: despite the abundant information for the treatment of vap and the establishment of guidelines, too many patients with dtt bacteria received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. since 45% of the cases are related to non-adherence to the local protocol, there is room for improvement by implementing educational programs. also, since dtt bacteria are found in 23% of late-onset vap, empirical antibiotic treatment should be directed against these pathogens.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of plants from northeast of mexico.
traditional medicine has a key role in health care worldwide. obtaining scientific information about the efficacy and safety of the plants from our region is one of the goals of our research group. in this report, 17 plants were selected and collected in different localities from northeast mexico. the dried plants were separated into leaves, flowers, fruit, stems, roots and bark. each part was extracted with methanol, and 39 crude extracts were prepared. the extracts were tested for their antimicrobial activity using three gram-negative bacterial strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii), three gram-positive bacterial strains (enterococcus faecalis and two staphylococcus aureus strains), and seven clinically isolated yeasts (candida albicans, c. krusei, c. tropicalis, c. parapsilosis and c. glabrata); their antioxidant activity was tested using a dpph free radical assay. no activity against gram-negative bacteria was observed with any extract up to the maximum concentration tested, 1000 mug ml(-1). we report here for the first time activity of ceanothus coeruleus against s. aureus (flowers, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) 125 mug ml(-1)), c. glabrata (mics 31.25 mug ml(-1)) and c. parapsilosis (mics between 31.25 and 125 mug ml(-1)); chrysanctinia mexicana against c. glabrata (mics 31.25 mug ml(-1)); colubrina greggii against e. faecalis (mics 250 mug ml(-1)) and cordia boissieri against c. glabrata (mic 125 mug ml(-1)). furthermore, this is the first report about antioxidant activity of extracts from ceanothus coeruleus, chrysanctinia mexicana, colubrina greggii and cyperus alternifolius. some correlation could exist between antioxidant activity and antiyeast activity against yeasts in the species ceanothus coeruleus, schinus molle, colubrina greggii and cordia boissieri.
evaluation of antimicrobial peptides as novel bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored platelets.
background: a single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. there is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (plts), and red blood cells. study design and methods: in this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (amps) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored plt concentrates (pcs). nine synthetic amps, four from plt microbicidal protein-derived peptides (pd1-4) and five arg-trp (rw) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and pc samples spiked with staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacillus cereus. a 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. results: in both plasma alone and pcs, rw3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae; pd4 and rw2 against p. aeruginosa; and rw4 against k. pneumoniae. the activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. conclusions: these findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic amps against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, pcs, and other blood products.
antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of pegylated poly(amidoamine) dendrimers.
we have investigated the antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of a series of amino-terminated poly(amidoamine) (pamam) dendrimers modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (peg) groups. the antibacterial activity of the pamam dendrimers and their derivatives against the common ocular pathogens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, was evaluated by their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the unmodified third and fifth generation (g3 and g5) amino-terminated dendrimers, the mics against both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were in the range of 6.3-12.5 microg ml(-1), comparable to that of the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 (1.3-12.5 microg ml(-1)) and within the wide range of 0.047-128 microg ml(-1) for the fluoroquinolone antibiotics. pegylation of the dendrimers decreased their antibacterial activities, especially for the gram-positive bacteria (s. aureus). the reduction in potency is likely due to the decrease in the number of protonated amino groups and shielding of the positive charges by the peg chains, thus decreasing the electrostatic interactions of the dendrimers with the negatively-charged bacterial surface. interestingly, localization of a greater number of amino groups on g5 vs. g3 dendrimers did not improve the potency. significantly, even a low degree of pegylation, e.g. 6% with eg(11) on g3 dendrimer, greatly reduced the cytotoxicity towards human corneal epithelial cells while maintaining a high potency against p. aeruginosa. the cytotoxicity of the pegylated dendrimers to host cells is much lower than that reported for antimicrobial peptides. furthermore, the mics of these dendrimers against p. aeruginosa are more than two orders of magnitude lower than other antimicrobial polymers reported to date. these results motivate further exploration of the potential of cationic dendrimers as a new class of antimicrobial agents that may be less likely to induce bacterial resistance than standard antibiotics.
ceftobiprole: a new cephalosporin for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections.
ceftobiprole is among the first of a new generation of cephalosporins with activity against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, which extends to cefepime-sensitive pseudomonas aeruginosa, and activity against gram-positive organisms, which includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. ceftobiprole is currently undergoing evaluation by the us fda for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, with a decision pending further evaluation of study site monitoring. it is also being evaluated for the treatment of community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonia. two phase iii multicenter trials have demonstrated noninferiority in complicated skin and skin structure infections when tested against vancomycin in primarily gram-positive bacterial infections, and when tested against vancomycin plus ceftazidime in gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. it is well tolerated, with the most common side effects being nausea and dysgeusia. ceftobiprole is likely to prove useful as an empiric as well as directed monotherapy in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, in which both gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant s. aureus and gram-negative pathogens including cefepime-sensitive p. aeruginosa may be involved.
bioactive triterpenes from diospyros blancoi.
the ethyl acetate extract of the air-dried leaves of diospyros blancoi afforded isoarborinol methyl ether (1), a mixture of alpha-amyrin palmitate, alpha-amyrin palmitoleate, beta-amyrin palmitate and beta-amyrin palmitoleate (2) in a 13 : 4 : 3 : 1 ratio, and squalene. the structures of 1, 2 and squalene were elucidated by extensive 1d and 2d nmr spectroscopy. compounds 1 and 2 exhibited antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus and trichophyton mentagrophytes, and were found inactive against bacillus subtilis and aspergillus niger. sample 2 exhibited significant analgaesic and anti-inflammatory activities.
small-colony variant selection as a survival strategy for staphylococcus aureus in the presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
previously it has been demonstrated that staphylococcus aureus is sensitive toward pseudomonas-secreted exotoxins, which preferentially target the electron transport chain in staphylococci. here it is shown that a subpopulation of s. aureus survives these respiratory toxins of pseudomonas aeruginosa by selection of the small-colony variant (scv) phenotype. purified pyocyanin alone causes the same effect. a hemb mutant of s. aureus survives cocultivation with p. aeruginosa without a decrease in cfu.
antibacterial properties of cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive: does the polymerization reaction play a role?
purpose: to ascertain if the polymerization reaction also contributes additionally to the antibacterial effects of two commonly used cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives. materials and methods: fresh liquid ethyl-cyanoacrylate (ec) and n-butyl-cyanoacrylate (bc) adhesives were applied onto 6-mm sterile filter paper discs. in the first group, the adhesive-soaked discs were immediately placed onto confluent monolayer cultures of bacteria, allowing the polymerization reaction to proceed while in culture. in the second group, the adhesive-soaked disc was allowed to first polymerize prior to being placed onto the bacterial cultures. four types of bacteria were studied: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. immediately after the discs were applied, the cultures were incubated at 35 degrees c for 24 h. bacterial inhibitory halos were measured in the cultures at the end of the incubation period. results: for ec, exposure of the bacteria to the cyanoacrylate polymerization reaction increased the bacterial inhibitory halos in streptococcus pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. for bc, it increased the bacterial inhibitory halos in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. no inhibitory halos were observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the bactericidal effect was higher in actively polymerizing ec, compared to previously polymerized ec in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and escherichia coli; however, no such differences were observed for bc. conclusions: the polymerization reaction may also be an important factor in the antibacterial properties of ec and bc.
new carvotanacetone derivatives from sphaeranthus africanus.
the dichloromethane extract of the air-dried leaves of sphaeranthus africanus afforded four new carvotanacetone derivatives (1, 2, 3a, and 3b). their structures were elucidated by extensive 1d and 2d nmr spectroscopy. compounds 1- 3 exhibited antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against candida albicans, trichophyton mentagrophytes and aspergillus niger.
new antimicrobial agents for use in the intensive care unit.
timely provision of adequate antimicrobial coverage in an initial anti-infective  treatment regimen results in optimal outcomes for bacterial and fungal infections. however, selection of appropriate antimicrobial regimens for treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (icu) can be challenging due to expansion of resistance, which typically requires use of multidrug anti-infective regimens to provide adequate coverage of important pathogens commonly seen in the icu setting. indeed, a recent additional call to action by the infectious diseases society of america (idsa) has enforced the impact that antimicrobial-resistant pathogens can have on patient care. the term eskape has been coined by this idsa group to refer to enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, the etiologic causes of the majority of hospital-acquired infections in the united states that are able to effectively "escape" our antibiotic arsenal and that also mandate discovery of new antimicrobial agents. this article reviews select antibacterial agents and an antifungal agent in late stages of clinical development that appear to have potential for treatment of infections in the icu.
increased resistance of contact lens-related bacterial biofilms to antimicrobial  activity of soft contact lens care solutions.
purpose: to determine if clinical and reference strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and staphylococcus aureus form biofilms on silicone hydrogel contact lenses and ascertain antimicrobial activities of contact lens care solutions. methods: clinical and american type culture collection reference strains of p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens, and s. aureus were incubated with lotrafilcon a lenses under conditions that facilitate biofilm formation. biofilms were quantified by quantitative culturing (colony-forming units, cfus), and gross morphology and architecture were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. susceptibilities of the planktonic and biofilm growth phases of the bacteria to 5 common multipurpose contact lens care solutions and 1 hydrogen peroxide care solution were assessed. results: pseudomonas aeruginosa, s. marcescens, and s. aureus reference and clinical strains formed biofilms on lotrafilcon a silicone hydrogel contact lenses, as dense networks of cells arranged in multiple layers with visible extracellular matrix. the biofilms were resistant to commonly used biguanide-preserved multipurpose care solutions. pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus biofilms were susceptible to a hydrogen peroxide and a polyquaternium-preserved care solution, whereas s. marcescens biofilm was resistant to a polyquaternium-preserved care solution but susceptible to hydrogen peroxide disinfection. in contrast, the planktonic forms were always susceptible. conclusion: pseudomonas aeruginosa, s. marcescens, and s. aureus form biofilms on lotrafilcon a contact lenses, which in contrast to planktonic cells are resistant to the antimicrobial activity of several soft contact lens care products.
eleucine indica possesses antioxidant, antibacterial and cytotoxic properties.
the use of evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine is increasing rapidly. eleucine indica (ei) is traditionally used in ailments associated with liver and kidneys. the therapeutic benefit of the medicinal plants is often attributed to their antioxidant properties. therefore, the aim of this study was to screen the hexane, dicholoromethane, ethyl acetate (ea) and methanol extracts (meth) of ei for their antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-cancer effects using total phenolic contents (tpcs) and dpph, disc diffusion method and mtt cytotoxicity assays, respectively. the meth was showed to have the highest tpc and scavenging activity (77.7%) on dpph assay, followed by ea (64.5%), hexane (47.19%) and dcm (40.83%) extracts, whereas the meth showed no inhibitory effect on all tested bacteria strains. however, the ea extract exhibited a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against all tested bacteria except bacillus subtilis, in which this bacterium was found to be resistant to all ei extracts. meanwhile, hexane extract was demonstrated to have a remarkable antibacterial activity against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the dicholoromethane extract did not exhibit significant activity against p. aeruginosa. none of the extracts showed significant cytotoxic activity towards mcf-7, ht-29 and cem-ss human cancer cell lines after 72 h incubation time (ic(50) > 30 mug/ml). these results demonstrate that the extract prepared from the ei possesses antioxidant activity in vitro in addition to antibacterial properties. further investigations are needed to verify the antioxidant effects in vitro and in vivo.
synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(ii) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (osn2) schiff base ligands.
cobalt ion complexes with the schiff bases, (4-x-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (x=methoxy (ome), phenylazo (n(2)ph), bromo (br), nitro (no(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (c, h, n), ftir, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. the thermal stability of free ligands and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) and thermogravimetric analyses (tga). cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. the synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four gram-positive bacteria: streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus anthracis and also against the two gram-negative bacteria: klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity data show that the parent schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.
antibacterial activity on citrullus colocynthis leaf extract.
studies on the antibacterial activities of the leaf extract of citrullus colocynthis (cucurbitaceae), a medicinal plant used for the treatment of various ailments was carried out using agar disc diffusion technique. the results revealed that the crude acetone extract exhibited antibacterial activities against pseudomonas aeruginosa with zones of inhibition measuring 14.0mm. the chloroform leaf extract exhibited no antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration for the chloroform extract was 4.0mm for escherichia coli.
effectiveness of honey on staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.
objectives: biofilms formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) and staphylococcus aureus (sa) have been shown to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis (crs). as well, honey has been used as an effective topical antimicrobial agent for years. our objective is to determine the in vitro effect of honey against biofilms produced by pa and sa. study design: in vitro testing of honey against bacterial biofilms. methods: we used a previously established biofilm model to assess antibacterial activity of honey against 11 methicillin-susceptible sa (mssa), 11 methicillin-resistant sa (mrsa), and 11 pa isolates. honeys were tested against both planktonic and biofilm-grown bacteria. results: honey was effective in killing 100 percent of the isolates in the planktonic form. the bactericidal rates for the sidr and manuka honeys against mssa, mrsa, and pa biofilms were 63-82 percent, 73-63 percent, and 91-91 percent, respectively. these rates were significantly higher (p<0.001) than those seen with single antibiotics commonly used against sa. conclusion: honey, which is a natural, nontoxic, and inexpensive product, is effective in killing sa and pa bacterial biofilms. this intriguing observation may have important clinical implications and could lead to a new approach for treating refractory crs.
cross-kingdom interactions: candida albicans and bacteria.
bacteria and fungi are found together in a myriad of environments and particularly in a biofilm, where adherent species interact through diverse signaling mechanisms. yet, despite billions of years of coexistence, the area of research exploring fungal-bacterial interactions, particularly within the context of polymicrobial infections, is still in its infancy. however, reports describing a multitude of wide-ranging interactions between the fungal pathogen candida albicans and various bacterial pathogens are on the rise. an example of a mutually beneficial interaction is coaggregation, a phenomenon that takes place in oral biofilms where the adhesion of c. albicans to oral bacteria is considered crucial for its colonization of the oral cavity. in contrast, the interaction between c. albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa is described as being competitive and antagonistic in nature. another intriguing interaction is that occurring between staphylococcus aureus and c. albicans, which although not yet fully characterized, appears to be initially synergistic. these complex interactions between such diverse and important pathogens would have significant clinical implications if they occurred in an immunocompromised host. therefore, understanding the mechanisms of adhesion and signaling involved in fungal-bacterial interactions may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for impeding microbial colonization and development of polymicrobial disease.
a study of 3-substituted benzylidene-1,3-dihydro-indoline derivatives as antimicrobial and antiviral agents.
3-substituted benzylidene-1,3-dihydro-indoline derivatives were tested for their  in vitro antibacterial activity against the gram-negative bacteria klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and the gram-positive bacteria bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and for their their in vitro antifungal activity against candida krusei and candida albicans. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were determined by the 2-fold serial dilution technique in mueller hinton broth and sabouraud dextrose agar using antibacterial and antifungal assays, respectively. for comparison of the antimicrobial activity, rifampicin, ampicillin trihydrate, gentamicin sulfate, and ofloxacin were used as reference antibacterial agents, and fluconazole and amphotericin b were employed as reference antifungal agents. the most active compound 10 showed notable inhibition against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and candida krusei. compounds 1 and 6 were found slightly effective against klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. in addition, compounds 13 and 14 showed inhibition against bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. indole derivatives were also tested in vitro for replication of the hepad38 cell line and compared with lamivudine (3tc, l-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine). the ic50 values of the compounds were found to be >1000 microm against hbv except for compound 13 which exhibited activity with an ic50 value of 500 microm.
isolation and identification of antimicrobial compound from mentha longifolia l.  leaves grown wild in iraq.
background: mentha longifolia l. (lamiaceae) leaves have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation by the indigenous people of iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. in the present study, an antimicrobial compound was isolated and characterized, and its biological activity was assessed. methods: the compound was isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oil using different spectral techniques: tlc, ftir spectra and hplc. antimicrobial activity of the compound was assessed using both disc diffusion and microdilution method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. results: a known compound was isolated from the essential oil of the plant and was identified as (-) menthol. the isolated compound was investigated for its antimicrobial activity against seven selected pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenis, lactobacillus acidophilus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast candida albicans. menthol at different concentrations (1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20) was active against all tested bacteria except for p. aeruginosa, and the highest inhibitory effect was observed against s. mutans (zone of inhibition: 25.3 mm) using the disc diffusion method. minimal inhibitory concentration mic values ranged from 15.6-125.0 microg/ml, and the most promising results were observed against s. aureus and s. mutans (mic 15.6 microg/ml) while, s. faecalis, s. pyogenis and l. acidophilus ranked next (mic 31.2 microg/ml). furthermore, menthol achieved considerable antifungal activity against the yeast c. albicans (zone of inhibition range: 7.1-18.5 mm; mic: 125.0). conclusion: the isolation of an antimicrobial compound from m. longifolia leaves validates the use of this plant in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation.

in this study, hbd-2 eukaryotic expression recombinant plasmid pcdna 3.1-zeo(+)-hbd-2 was constructed by the molecular cloning technologies, and 293 cells were transfected by liposome. the cell culture supernatant was collected and its antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus atcc25923 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853 were tested. the antibacterial activity against s. aureus of the culture supernatant of the hbd-2 gene transfected-293 cells was detected, whereas in the same condition, the antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa was not detected. this result suggested that hbd-2 may preferentially kill staphylococcus aureus.
[mutant prevention concentrations of antibacterial agents to ocular pathogenic bacteria].
objective: to establish a method to measure mutant prevention concentration (mpc) in vitro, and to measure mpc of antibacterial agents for ocular bacteria caused keratitis. methods: it was an experimental study. forty strains of ocular bacteria were separated from cornea in beijing institute of ophthalmology, which included 8 strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of the levofloxacin (lvf), ofloxacin (ofl), ciprofloxacin (cip), norfloxacin (nfl), tobramycin (tob) and chloromycetin (chl) were determined by agar dilution method from national committee of clinical laboratory standard (nccls). the mpc were measured by accumulate-bacterial methods with bacterial population inoculated more than 1.2 x 10(10) colony forming units per milliliter with mueller-hinton broth and tryptic soy agar plate. with the software of spss 11.0, the datum such as the range of mic, mpc, mic90 and mpc90 were calculated, and the selection index (mpc90/ mi90) and mutant selection window (msw) were obtained. results: the mi90 of lvf and tob (4 mg/l) to staphylococcus aureus strains were the lowest. cip showed the lowest mic90 (0.25 mg/l) to pseudomonas aeruginosa among six kinds of antibacterial agents. the mic90 of lvf to staphylococcus epidermidis (256 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (1 mg/l) and klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l) were lower than other antibacterial agents. the mpc90, msw and the mpc90/mic90 of levofloxacin showed lower values compared with other antibacterial medicines. from all the datum, the mic90 of chl was the highest and the activity was the weakest. although the activity of lvf was higher to every kind of bacteria, cip had the highest activity antibacterial to pseudomonas aeruginosa. the capacity of chl and tob was weaker than quinolones for restricting resistant mutants on ocular bacteria. lvf had the strongest capacity for restricting resistant mutants among quinolones. conclusion: lvf has better antibacterial effects and stronger capacity for restricting the selection of resistant mutants on ocular bacteria than other antibacterial agents.
a longitudinal analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility in clinical institutions  in germany as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (2004-2007).
background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) global surveillance program has been designed to assess the in vitro activity of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent tigecycline plus several comparative agents. methods: in vitro activities of bacterial isolates obtained from 13 centers in germany between 2004 and 2007 were evaluated longitudinally and pooled, using the interpretive criteria of the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast). results: tigecycline demonstrated good activity against both gram-positive and -negative pathogens monitored in this study [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (mic(90)) 0.06-2 microg/ml] with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had elevated mics for most antimicrobial agents. imipenem and meropenem also showed good activity (mic(90) <or=0.06-4 microg/ml) against most gram-negative pathogens but were less active against gram-positive organisms (mic(90) <or=0.12 to >or=32 microg/ml). conclusions: tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens monitored in the t.e.s.t. study. a low tigecycline mic(90) was reported against acinetobacter baumannii and drug-resistant enterococcus faecium,staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the carbapenems showed the lowest mic(90) values against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive e. coli. e. coli susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents decreased over the course of this study.
cationic compounds with activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria: interest of a new compound compared with two older antiseptics, hexamidine and chlorhexidine.
use of antiseptics and disinfectants is essential in infection control practices  in hospital and other healthcare settings. in this study, the in vitro activity of a new promising compound, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene (cx1), has been evaluated in comparison with hexamidine (hx) and chlorhexidine (chx), two older cationic antiseptics. the mics for 69 clinical isolates comprising methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (with or without meca), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamases and non-fermenting bacilli (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were determined. cx1 showed similar activity against s. aureus, cons and enterococcus spp., irrespective of the presence of meca or van genes, or associated resistance genes, with very good activity against cons (mic <1 mg/l). variable activities were observed against enterobacteriaceae; the mics determined seemed to be dependent both on the genus (mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively) and on the resistance phenotype production of [extended spectrum beta-lactase (esbls) or other beta-lactamases; overproduction of ampc]. poor activity was found against non-fermenting bacilli, irrespective of the resistance phenotype. chx appeared to be the most active compound against all strains, with broad-spectrum and conserved activity against multidrug-resistant strains. hx showed a lower activity, essentially against gram-positive strains. consequently, the differences observed with respect to cx1 suggest that they are certainly not the consequence of antibiotic resistance phenotypes, but rather the result of membrane composition modifications (e.g. of lipopolysaccharide), or of the presence of (activated) efflux-pumps. these results raise the possibility that cx1 may be a potent new antibacterial agent of somewhat lower activity but significantly lower toxicity than chx.
studies on the antimicrobial activity and brine shrimp toxicity of zeyheria tuberculosa (vell.) bur. (bignoniaceae) extracts and their main constituents.
background: due to the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial drugs, the emergence of human pathogenic microorganisms resistant to major classes of antibiotics has been increased and has caused many clinical problems in the treatment of infectious diseases. thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate for the first time the in vitro antimicrobial activity and brine shrimp lethality of extracts and isolated compounds from zeyheria tuberculosa (vell.) bur., a species used in brazilian folk medicine for treatment of cancer and skin diseases. methods: using the disc diffusion method, bioautography assay and brine shrimp toxicity test (artemia salina leach), we studied the antimicrobial activity and lethality of extracts and isolated compounds against three microorganisms strains, including gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria and yeasts (candida albicans). results: in this study, the extracts inhibited s. aureus (8.0 +/- 0.0 to 14.0 +/- 0.0 mm) and c. albicans (15.3 +/- 0.68 to 25.6 +/- 0.4 mm) growth. in the brine shrimp test, only two of them showed toxic effects (lc50 29.55 to 398.05 microg/ml) and some extracts were non-toxic or showed weak lethality (lc50 705.02 to > 1000 microg/ml). from these extracts, four flavones [5,6,7,8-tetramethoxyflavone (1), 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (2), 4'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8-tetramethoxyflavone (3), and 4'-hydroxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (4)] were isolated through bioassay-guided fractionation and identified based on the 1d and 2d nmr spectral data. by bioautography assays, compounds 1 [s. aureus (16.0 +/- 0.0 mm) and c. albicans (20.0 +/- 0.0 mm)] and 3 [s. aureus (10.3 +/- 0.6 mm) and c. albicans (19.7 +/- 0.6 mm)] inhibited both microorganisms while 2 inhibited only s. aureus (11.7 +/- 0.6 mm). compound 4 did not restrain the growth of any tested microorganism. conclusion: our results showed that extracts and isolated flavones from z. tuberculosa may be particularly useful against two pathogenic microorganisms, s. aureus and c. albicans. these results may justify the popular use this species since some fractions tested had antimicrobial activity and others showed significant toxic effects on brine shrimps. however, in order to evaluate possible clinical application in therapy of infectious diseases, further studies about the safety and toxicity of isolated compounds are needed.

limazepines a-f, pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine antibiotics from an indonesian micrococcus sp.
in our screening of indonesian microorganisms for novel bioactive natural products we have isolated seven new compounds, designated as limazepines a, b1 and b2 (isolated as an isomeric mixture), c, d, e, and f, from the culture broth of micrococcus sp. strain icbb 8177. in addition, the known natural products prothracarcin and 7-o-succinylmacrolactin a, as well as two previously reported synthetic compounds, 2-amino-3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid methyl ester and 4-ethylpyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde, were obtained from the extract. chemical structures were determined by spectroscopic methods and by comparison with the nmr data of structurally related compounds. the limazepines belong to the growing group of the pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine antitumor antibiotics isolated from various soil bacteria. limazepines b1/b2 mixture, c, and e were active against the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus and the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli. limazepine d was also active against s. aureus, but was not active against e. coli. interestingly, only the limazepines b1/b2 mixture and d were active against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
antibacterial activities of dodonaea viscosa using contact bioautography technique.
the crude ethanolic extract and n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous fractions of dodonaea viscosa were analyzed for antibacterial potential against four gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa. preliminary screening showed inhibition against staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the thin layer chromatograms of the fractions were then subjected to contact bioautography, which showed inhibition zone at different r(f) values against bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the presence of antibacterial components. the mic of each fraction was determined through a 96-well micro-titer plate method. the non-viability of the organisms was ascertained by determining the mbc of the fractions.
leptoglycin: a new glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the south american frog leptodactylus pentadactylus (leptodactylidae).
antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of a novel neutral glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. the amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by rp-hplc (c(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by edman degradation: gllggllgpllgggggggggll. leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 8 microm, 50 microm, and 75 microm respectively, but it did not show antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (candida albicans and candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (microsporum canis and trichophyton rubrum). no hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microm range concentration. the amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of gly/leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.
[experimental research in vitro on antibacterial property and biocompatibility of silver-containing hydroxyapatite coating].
objective: to prepare silver-containing hydroxyapatite coating (hydroxyapatite/ag, ha/ag) and investigate its antibacterial property and biocompatibility in vitro. methods: vacuum plasma spraying technique was adopted to prepare ha/ag coating on titanium alloy substrate (3% ag). after incubating the ha/ag and the ha coating under staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa suspensions of 2% tryptic soy broth (tbs) medium for 2, 4 and 7 days, respectively, the biofilm on the coatings was examined by confocal laser scanning microscope, and the bacterial density and viable bacterial percentage of bacterial biofilm were calculated. meanwhile, the micro-morphology of bacterial biofilm was observed by sem, the cytotoxicity was detected via mtt and the biocompatibility of biofilm was evaluated by acute haemolysis test. results: compared with ha coating, the bacterial biofilm's thickness on the surface of ha/ag coating witnessed no significant difference at 2 days after culture (p > 0.05), but decreased obviously at 4 and 7 days after culture (p < 0.01). the bacterial density of the biofilm increased with time, but there was no significant difference between two coatings (p > 0.05) at 2, and 7 days after culture. the viable bacterial percentage of the biofilms on the surface of ha/ag coating decreased obviously compared with that of ha coating at 2, 4 and 7 days after culture (p < 0.01). the mtt notified the cytotoxic grade of both coatings was zero. the acute haemolysis assay showed that the hemolytic rate of ha/ag and ha coating was 0.19% and 0.12%, respectively. conclusion: with good biocompatibility, significant antibacterial property against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, no obvious cytotoxicity and no erythrocyte destruction, the vacuum plasma sprayed ha/ag coating is a promising candidate for the surface of orthopedic metal implants to improve their osseointegration and antibacterial property.
[microbiological diagnosis of bronchopulmonary colonization-infection in cystic fibrosis].
cystic fibrosis (cf), a condition produced by mutations in the gene that encodes  the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, is the most prevalent autosomal-recessive hereditary disease in caucasian populations. among other repercussions, this defect leads to an alteration of respiratory secretions and determines a predisposition for chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection, which is the main driver of the high morbidity and early mortality of cf patients. colonization by staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae is frequent in children younger than 10 years, but mucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa is by far the most relevant pathogen in adults with cf and is responsible for the progressive bronchopulmonary deterioration. as a consequence of repeated, long-lasting antimicrobial treatments and deterioration of lung function, colonization by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli, such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia, achromobacter spp. and burkholderia cepacia complex, is also frequent in adult cf patients. the special characteristics of the pathologic process and the microorganisms implicated in cf make it advisable to consider microbiological follow-up of chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection in these patients a specific diagnostic entity.
isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.
aim of the study: the aerial parts of thymus kotschyanus boiss. and hohen. (lamiaceae) and flower buds of dianthus caryophyllus l. (caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. in this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. materials and methods: compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: tlc, ftir spectra and hplc. the minimum inhibitory concentrations mic values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. results: two known compounds were isolated from the essential oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. the isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thymol mic values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and b. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a mic value of 15.6 microg/ml. eugenol achieved stronger mic values against most tested pathogens and the best mic value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes and k. pneumoniae whereas, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and e. coli were inhibited with a mic value of 31.2 microg/ml. combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the best synergistic result was seen against p. mirabilis and e. coli. conclusions: the isolation of two antibacterial compounds from thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.
antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers based on calcium hydroxide and mta.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a new root canal sealer containing calcium hydroxide (acroseal) and the root canal sealer based on mta (endo cpm sealer), in comparison with traditional sealers (sealapex, sealer 26 and intrafill) and white mta-angelus, against five different microorganism strains. the materials and their components were evaluated after manipulation, employing the agar diffusion method. a base layer was made using muller-hinton agar (mh) and wells were made by removing agar. the materials were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. the microorganisms used were: micrococcus luteus (atcc9341), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc27853), candida albicans (atcc 10231), and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 10541). the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the results showed that sealapex and its base paste, sealer 26 and its powder, endo cpm sealer and its powder, white mta and its powder all presented antimicrobial activity against all strains. intrafill and its liquid presented antimicrobial activity against all strains except p. aeruginosa and acroseal was effective only against m. luteus and s. aureus.
changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
antibacterial activity of epidural infusions.
the incidence of epidural abscess following epidural catheterisation appears to be increasing, being recently reported as one in 1000 among surgical patients. this study was designed to investigate the antibacterial activity of various local anaesthetics and additives, used in epidural infusions, against a range of micro-organisms associated with epidural abscess. the aim was to determine which, if any, epidural infusion solution has the greatest antibacterial activity. bupivacaine, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine crystals were dissolved and added to mueller-hinton agar in concentrations of 0.06%, 0.125%, 0.2%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1%. fentanyl, adrenaline and clonidine were also mixed with agar in isolation and in combination with the local anaesthetics. using a reference agar dilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for a range of bacteria. bupivacaine showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli with minimum inhibitory concentrations between 0.125% and 0.25%. it did not inhibit the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa at any of the concentrations tested. levobupivacaine and ropivacaine showed no activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, even at the highest concentrations tested, and minimal activity against escherichia coli (minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.5% and 1% respectively). the presence of fentanyl, adrenaline and clonidine had no additional effect on the antibacterial activity of any of the local anaesthetic agents. the low concentrations of local anaesthetic usually used in epidural infusions have minimal antibacterial activity. while the clinical implications of this in vitro study are not known, consideration should be given to increasing the concentration of bupivacaine in an epidural infusion or to administering a daily bolus of 0.25% bupivacaine to reduce the risk of epidural bacterial growth.
sar study of clubbed [1,2,4]-triazolyl with fluorobenzimidazoles as antimicrobial and antituberculosis agents.
in the present study, a series of novel 2-[4-(1h-[1,2,4]-triazol-1-yl)phenyl]-1-substituted-4,6-difluoro-1h-benzo[d]imida zole derivatives are synthesized by the alkylation of 2-[4-(1h-[1,2,4]-triazol-1-yl)phenyl]-4,6-difluoro-1h-benzo[d]imidazole with substituted alkyl and aryl halides. the compounds were evaluated for their preliminary in-vitro antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella typhosa and then were screened for their antitubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv strain by broth microdilution assay method. the antibacterial data suggested that the analogs with electronegative substituents emerged as promising antimicrobials. it was also observed that the promising antimicrobials have proved to be better antimycobacterials. few of selected analogs are under further evaluation for secondary antitubercular screening, as they have shown better activity compared to rifampin.
[investigation of the effect of efflux pump inhibitors to mic values of ciprofloxacin in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus].
the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of efflux pump inhibitors on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of ciprofloxacin (cip) in fluoroquinolone-resistant 42 pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 42), escherichia coil (n= 97), acinetobacter baumannii (n= 58) and staphylococcus aureus (n= 80) strains isolated from clinical specimens. for this purpose phenylalanyl-arginyl-beta-naphthylamide (pa beta n) was used for p. aeruginosa, e. coli, a. baumannii and reserpine for s. aureus isolates as pump inhibitors. fluoroquinolone resistance of the clinical isolates were determined by vitek2 compact (biomerieux, france) automated system and confirmed with standard broth microdilution method. for the investigation of the effects of inhibitor agents, the mic values were also determined in the presence of 25 microg/ml and 100 microg/ml pa beta n and 20 microg/ml reserpine. in the presence of 25 mg/l pa beta n, 61.9% of cip resistant p. aeruginosa strains converted to susceptible ones, while this rate was 73.8% in the presence of 100 mg/l pa beta n. in a. baumannii clinical isolates, 8.6% and 15.5% of cip-resistant strains have become susceptible in the presence of 25 mg/l and 100 mg/l pa beta n, respectively. similarly the mic values for cip have decreased > or = 4 folds in 42.2%, and > or = 2 folds in 30.9% of e. coli isolates, in the presence of 25 mg/l pa beta n, however, there was no change in mics of 26.9% of e. coli strains. the mic values have also been lowered for > or = 4 folds in 83.6%, and two folds in 13.4% of e. coli strains by the use of 100 mg/l pa beta n concentration, however, no decrease in mic values was detected in 3% of the isolates. 20 mg/l of reserpine have caused a decrease of > or = 4 folds in 8.75%, and two folds in 33.75% of s. aureus isolates, while there was no change in mic values of 57.5% of s. aureus strains. our results showed that pa beta n causes significant reduction in mic values for cip in the clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa, e. coli and a. baumannii and this effect may be attributed to efflux pump inhibition. in contrast, it was concluded that reserpine does not have a considerable effect on the mic values of s. aureus against ciprofloxacin.
antimicrobial property of a herbal preparation containing dalbergia sissoo and datura tramonium with cow urine against pathogenic bacteria.
in this study, a herbal preparation containing dalbergia sissoo and datura stramoium with cow urine (dsds), was evaluated for its antibacterial potential against pathogenic strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. antibacterial activity was compared to standard antibiotic drugs i.e. chloramphenicol (30 mcg), ampicillin (10 mcg), nalidixic acid (10 mcg) and rifampicin (30 mcg). cow urine extract was found to be most active against both gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. clinical isolate of s. aureus showed higher sensitivity towards cow urine extract of dsds than standard strains, and inhibited growth on most regulatory levels such as inhibition of protein, dna, rna and peptidoglycan synthesis. the results of the present study shows that the cow urine extract of dsds may be used as a potent antiseptic preparation for prevention and treatment of chronic bacterial infections.
discovery of novel 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives as anti-gram-positive antibacterial agents.
a number of 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives were synthesized and examined for growth inhibition of several kinds of bacteria. 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone itself exhibited no antibacterial activity, but some of its derivatives showed various antibacterial activities depending on functional groups introduced on the 2-phenyl ring. eighteen out of 24 compounds synthesized in this study appeared to possess antibacterial activities against at least two gram-positive strains of bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, 2-(biphenyl-4-yl)-2',3',4'-trihydroxyacetophenone being the most active with lc(50) of 5.8 mum and 5.6 mum respectively. however, none of the synthesized compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on gram-negative strains, such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica, suggesting that anti-gram-positive specificity of the antibacterial compounds.
antibacterial effect of dressings containing multivalent silver ion carried by zirconium phosphate on experimental rat burn wounds.
to evaluate the antibacterial effect of multivalent silver ion carried by zirconium phosphate (zp-ag) both in vitro and in an experimental rat burn wound compared with that of sulfadiazine silver (sd-ag). firstly, the minimal inhibition concentration and the minimal bactericidal concentration of zp-ag to three different strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli) were compared with those of sd-ag in vitro. following this dressings containing the same mass of zp-ag or sd-ag were applied to wounds in a rat burn model and their antimicrobial activity assayed. the inflammatory response of the wounds managed with the two kinds of dressings was compared. both the minimal inhibition concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of zp-ag to s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and e. coli were two to four times lower than those of sd-ag. in vivo zp-ag had a more effective antibacterial action inhibiting the growth of the above three bacterial strains under burn scar, compared with dressings made from the same mass of sd-ag. moreover, the antibacterial effect was unchanged after the zp-ag dressings were washed 20 times, while it dramatically decreased after the dressings with sd-ag were washed 20 times. when covered by either regular or washed zp-ag dressings, the wounds showed integrity with no visible inflammatory reaction. however, various extents of inflammatory reactions on or around the wounds covered with regular sd-ag dressing were observed. this study showed that dressings with zp-ag had a prominent and relative long-term antibacterial effect. zp-ag dressings could be an effective, low-cost management option for burn wounds.
anti-infectious activity of tryptophan metabolites in the l-tryptophan-l-kynurenine pathway.
to study the anti-infectious effect of a vascular allograft, the antimicrobial activity of tryptophan metabolites mediated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was determined. the growth of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) over 10 h in extracts from post-transplantation vascular allograft was significantly slower than that of extracts from non-transplantation vascular allograft regardless of the presence of tryptophan (p<0.05). when the antimicrobial activity of the tryptophan metabolites in the l-tryptophan-l-kynurenine pathway was examined, 3-hydroxy-dl-kynurenine and alpha-picolinic acid had strong antibacterial activity against mrsa, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, although antimicrobial activities of anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid against them were low. the results showed that, of the tested tryptophan metabolites, 3-hydroxy-dl-kynurenine and alpha-picolinic acid contributed to the anti-infectious effects of the allograft by inhibiting of the growth of microorganisms.
antibacterial activity of endemic satureja khuzistanica jamzad essential oil against oral pathogens.
introduction: to assess the antibacterial effects of an iranian endemic essential oil, satureja khuzistanica jamzad (skj) when used as an intracanal antiseptic and interappointment medicament. materials and methods: antimicrobial activity and minimum inhibition concentrations (mics) of skj essential oil with and without calcium hydroxide (ch) against eleven aerobic, microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria were assessed. the evaluation was carried out by agar dilution and well diffusion methods. the results were measured and recorded by an independent observer. data were analyzed statistically using student t-test. results: the mic for eight species was recorded in 0.31 mg/ml of essential oil. pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mic value of 1.25 mg/ml appeared to be the most resistant bacterium; while only 0.16 mg/ml of essential oil was sufficient to inhibit the growth of bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. the inhibition zone of the antiseptic oil (at 0.31 mg/ml) with e. faecalis in the well diffusion method was 13 mm; this was comparable with 12.5 mm inhibition zone value of the tetracycline disc (30 microg). no synergistic effect was found in combination of essential oil and ch powder. conclusion: skj essential oil with the concentration of 0.31 mg/ml is effective against most of oral pathogens including e. faecalis.
detection of antimicrobial compounds by bioautography of different extracts of leaves of selected south african tree species.
the hexane, acetone, dichloromethane and methanol extracts of combretum vendae a.e. van wyk (combretaceae), commiphora harveyi (engl.) engl. (burseraceae), khaya anthotheca (welm.) c.dc (meliaceae), kirkia wilmsii engl. (kirkiaceae), loxostylis alata a. spreng. ex rchb. (anacardiaceae), ochna natalitia (meisn.) walp. (ochnaceae) and protorhus longifolia (bernh. ex c. krauss) engl. (anacardiaceae) were screened for their antimicrobial activity. the test organisms included bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus), and fungi (aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans, microsporum canis and sporothrix schenckii). a simple bioautographic procedure, involving spraying suspensions of the bacteria or fungi on thin layer chromatography (tlc) plates developed in solvents of varying polarities was used to detect the number of antibacterial and antifungal compounds present in the extracts. all the extracts had antimicrobial activity against at least one of the test microorganisms. this activity was denoted by white spots against a red-purple background on the tlc plates after spraying with tetrazolium violet. twenty seven tlc plates; 9 for each solvent system and 3 different solvent systems per organism were tested in the bioautographic procedure. of the bacteria tested, s. aureus was inhibited by the most compounds separated on the tlc plates from all the tested plants. similarly, growth of the fungus c. neoformans was also inhibited by many compounds present in the extracts. loxostylis alata appeared to be the plant extract with the highest number of inhibition bands when compared with other plants tested against both bacteria and fungi. this species was selected for in depth further study.
qualitative phytochemical screening and in vitro antimicrobial effects of methanol stem bark extract of ficus thonningii (moraceae).
the methanolic stem bark extract of ficus thonningii (moraceae) was subjected to  preliminary phytochemical screening and in vitro antimicrobial tests. the phytochemical tests was carried out using standard methods of analysis and these investigations revealed the presence of alkaloids, anthraquinones, carbohydrates, flavonoids, saponins and tannins. the antimicrobial activity of the plant extract was assayed using the agar plate disc diffusion and nutrient broth dilution techniques. test micro organisms were: escherichia coli, klebsiella spp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi (gram-negative), staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus spp. (gram-positive). the extracts inhibited the growth of all the test organisms at different concentrations especially against pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus spp. which had mean inhibition zone of 33.33+/-7.33 mm and 32.33+/-2.51 mm respectively. the results showed the mic of 10 mg ml(-1) against pseudomonas and 1.25 against remaining organisms tested. the mbc against staphylococcus aureus was 2.5 mg ml(-1) and that of streptococcus spp. was found to be 0.625 mg ml(-1). the extracts showed varied inhibitory activity against the organisms studied.
preliminary in vitro evaluation of an adjunctive therapy for extremity wound infection reduction: rapidly resorbing local antibiotic delivery.
despite the continuing advances in treatment of open fractures and musculoskeletal wounds, infection remains a serious complication. current treatments to prevent infection utilize surgical debridement and irrigation, and high doses of systemic antimicrobial therapy. the aim of this work was to evaluate, in vitro, the potential of a fast-resorbing calcium sulfate pellet loaded with an antibiotic. the pellet could be used as an adjunctive therapy at the time of debridement and irrigation to reduce bacterial wound contamination. small pellets containing a binder and calcium sulfate were engineered to resorb rapidly (within 24 h) and deliver high local doses of antibiotic (amikacin, gentamicin, or vancomycin) to the wound site while minimizing systemic effects. results from dissolution, elution, and biological activity tests against p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were used to compare the performance of antibiotic-loaded, rapidly resorbing calcium sulfate pellets to antibiotic-loaded crushed conventional calcium sulfate pellets. antibiotic-loaded rapidly resorbing pellets dissolved in vitro in deionized water in 12-16 h and released therapeutic antibiotic levels in phosphate buffered saline that were above the minimal inhibitory concentration for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus, completely inhibiting the growth of these bacteria for the life of the pellet. crushed conventional calcium sulfate pellets dissolved over 4-6 days, but the eluates only contained sufficient antibiotic to inhibit growth for the first 4 h. these data indicate that fast-resorbing pellets can release antibiotics rapidly and at therapeutic levels. adjunctive therapy with fast-acting pellets is promising and warrants further in vivo studies.
[the changing patterns and the associated factors of microbial pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia in a respiratory intensive care unit from 1995 to 2004].
objective: to investigate the changing patterns and associated factors of microbial pathogens which caused ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) in our respiratory intensive care unit (ricu) from 1995 to 2004. methods: cases of vap in our ricu from 1995 to 2004 (n = 137) were retrospectively analyzed, 47 cases from 1995 to 1999 and 90 cases from 2000 to 2004. vap was diagnosed according to the following criteria: pneumonia occurred 48 hours after tracheal intubations; new or progressive infiltrative opacities on chest x ray film; and at least two of the following clinical features: (1) temperature > 38.0 degrees c or < 35.5 degrees c, (2) wbc > 10 x 10(9)/l or < 4 x 10(9)/l, (3) purulent airway secretions; and positive bacterial cultures (the samples obtained through endotracheal intubations). the data were analyzed using statistical software spss version 11.5. continuous data were expressed as (-x) +/- s. t-test and chi(2)-test were used for continuous and categorical data, respectively. logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for special pathogens. results: the mean incidence of vap was 17.9% from 1995 to 2004 (137/765), 16.2% from 1995 to 1999 (n = 47, 3.1% - 29.8%) and 19.6% from 2000 to 2004 (n = 90, 12.4% - 27.7%). from 1995 to 1999, common pathogens were stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 15, 23.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12, 18.8%), aerobacter cloacae (n = 8, 12.5%) and acinetobacter baumanii (n = 7, 10.9%). from 2000 to 2004, common pathogens were acinetobacter baumanii (n = 40, 34.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 32, 27.4%), staphylococcus aureus (n = 24, 20.5%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 8, 6.8%). there were 2 cases (2/64, 3.1%) caused by staphylococcus aureus from 1995 to 1999, and both were caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa); there were 24 cases caused by staphylococcus aureus from 2000 to 2004, and 21 cases (21/117, 17.9%) were caused by mrsa.there were 11 (11/47, 23.4%) and 45 (45/90, 50.0%) cases with central intravenous catheters in the period of 1995 to 1999 and 2000 to 2004, respectively. in the period of 1995 to 1999 and 2000 to 2004, durations of aerosolized therapy were (46 +/- 55) and (28 +/- 30) days. there were 12 patients (12/47, 25.5%) using second-generation cephalosporin before vap occurred in the period of 1995 to 1999 and 7 patients (7/90, 7.8%) in the period of 2000 to 2004. there were 13 patients (13/47, 27.7%) using penicillin before vap in the period of 1995 to 1999 and 10 patients (10/90, 11.1%) in the period of 2000 to 2004. there were 10 patients (10/47, 21.3%) using quinolones before vap in the period of 1995 to 1999 and 46 patients (46/90, 51.1%)in the period of 2000 to 2004. the occurrence of staphylococcus aureus vap may be related to the cross-infection between inpatients (wald = 16.690, p < 0.01, or = 9.212). vap caused by stenotrophomonas maltophilia was positively related to duration of aerosolized therapy (wald = 7.852, p < 0.01, or = 1.021). vap caused by acinetobacter baumanii was positively related to third-generation cephalosporin usage (wald = 5.553, p < 0.05, or = 3.461). conclusions: the incidence of vap was not increased in the recent 10 years in our ricu, but the incidence of vap caused by acinetobacter baumanii. staphylococcus aureus and mrsa increased significantly, may be related to the decrease of duration of aerosolized therapy, the usage of different kinds of antibiotics and cross-infection between inpatients.
a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies. this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.
hylin a1, the first cytolytic peptide isolated from the arboreal south american frog hypsiboas albopunctatus ("spotted treefrog").
rp-hplc fractionation of the electrically stimulated skin secretion of the arboreal south american frog hypsiboas albopunctatus ("spotted treefrog") led to the isolation of a cytolytic c-terminally amidated peptide. this novel peptide, named hylin a1 (hy-a1), consists of 18 amino acid residues (ifgailplalgalknlik-nh(2)). the alpha-helical structure of the synthetic hylin a1 peptide was confirmed by cd spectroscopy in the presence of 60% (v/v) tfe. the synthetic peptide displayed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa and also against fungi (candida albicans, c. krusei, c. parapsilosis and cryptococcus neoformans). hylin a1 was also able to disrupt human erytrocytes (hc(50)=18 microm). similarity analysis using psi-blast revealed 50-44% of identity to maximins hv, h16, h15 and h10 from bombina maxima and also to hylins b1 and b2 (hy-b1 and hy-b2) from hypsiboas lundii (synonym: hyla biobeba).
microbiological and toxicological effects of perla black bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2005)].
from october 2005 to september 2006, we collected the specimen from 366 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 411 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 406 strains were examined. the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 70, streptococcus pneumoniae 85, haemophilus influenzae 78, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 46, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, klebsiella pneumoniae 21, and moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 40. of 70 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible s. aureus: mssa) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) were 38 (54.3%) and 32 (45.7%) strains, respectively. against mssa, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of 37 strains (97.4%) at 0.063 microg/ml or less. against mrsa, arbekacin and vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. in contrast, there were high-resistant strains (mic: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (38.1%) and clindamycin (22.6%). against h. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its mic90 was 0.063 microg/ml or less. meropenem showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its mic90 was 0.5 microg/ml. against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), arbekacin had the most potent activity and its mic90 was 8 microg/ml. against k. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis and the mic90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (53.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 44.3% and 29.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (15.4%), s. pneumoniae (23.4%), and h. influenzae (21.3%). s. aureus (25.4%) and s. pneumoniae (18.0%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (22.0%) and h. influenzae (21.4%). the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, and their isolation frequencies were each 35.3%.
susceptibility pattern of some clinical bacterial isolates to selected antibiotics and disinfectants.
the antibacterial activities of five antibiotics, three brands of ofloxacins (obenasin, floxavid and drovid) and two brands of ciprofloxacins (uroxin and siprosan), and five commonly used disinfectants (lysol, dettol, purit, roberts and wex-cide) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus spp. and bacillus spp. were investigated. the growth inhibitory effect of both the antibiotics and disinfectants were determined using paper disk diffusion method and well-in-agar technique respectively. the highest mean zone of growth inhibition (19.3 mm) was given by drovid on streptococcus spp., while the smallest (7.0 mm) was by floxavid on p. aeruginosa. lysol had the highest mean zone of growth inhibition (18.0 mm) on streptococcus spp. while p. aeruginosa and bacillus spp. had no zone of growth inhibition with roberts at 100-fold dilution. all the isolates were also resistant to wex-cide. the test organisms were found to be significantly susceptible to the routinely used antimicrobials tested. however, there is the need for continuous surveillance for the detection of emerging resistance pattern.
[case of sepsis caused by multidrug-resistant neutropenic-phase pseudomonas aeruginosa treated successfully with antibiotic combination therapy].
multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp), defined as pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to aminoglycosides, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones, has emerged as an increasingly problematic cause of hospital-acquired infection. with parenteral colistin unavailable in japan, effective antimicrobial options are severely limited. we report a case of mdrp bacteremia successfully treated with antibiotic combination therapy screened by a 'break-point checkerboard plate'. a 54-year-old man with malignant lymphoma who became febrile 9 days after a recent course of chemotherapy had a neutrophil count of 176/microl. treatment with meropenem and vancomycin was ineffective and high fever persisted. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and mdrp were isolated from blood culture and combination therapy with aztreonam and amikacin was selected for mdrp based on 'break-point checkerboard plate' results. linezolid was used for mrsa. the patient recovered successfully from mdrp and mrsa sepsis.
antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of phenolic compounds extracts of northeast portugal honey.
phenolic compounds of dark and clear honeys from tras-os-montes of portugal were  extracted with amberlite xad-2 and evaluated for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. the antioxidant effect was studied using the in vitro test capacity of scavenge the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (dpph) free radical and of reducing power of iron (iii)/ferricyanide complex. the antimicrobial activity was screened using three gram-positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus lentus) and three gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli). the results obtained from the partial identification of honey phenolic compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector showed that p-hydroxibenzoic acid, cinnamic acid, naringenin, pinocembrin and chrysin are the phenolic compounds present in most of the samples analyzed. antioxidant potential was dependent of honey extract concentration and the results showed that dark honey phenolic compounds had higher activity than the obtained from clear honey. in the biological assays, results showed that s. aureus were the most sensitive microrganisms and b. subtilis, s. lentus, k. pneumoniae and e. coli were each moderately sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of honey extracts. nevertheless, no antimicrobial activity was observed in the test with p. aeruginosa.
long-term, low-dose azithromycin treatment reduces the incidence but increases macrolide resistance in staphylococcus aureus in danish cf patients.
background: since 2001, long-term, low-dose azithromycin treatment has been used  for cf patients chronically infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa in the copenhagen cf centre. our study investigates changes in incidence of colonization with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis and changes in macrolide sensitivity in these microorganisms during azithromycin treatment. methods: cf patients treated continuously with azithromycin for at least 3 months were included. results of microbiological examination, including phage typing results of s. aureus, obtained during treatment were compared to results obtained 2 years before treatment. results: 70 patients (median age 29.1 years) treated for a median of 4 years (range 0.7-5.1) were included. before treatment, 44 patients had at least one culture positive for s. aureus compared to 25 patients during treatment (p<0.01). mean percentage of sputum samples with growth of s. aureus decreased from 12.1% (range 0-82.6%) before treatment to 6.1% (range 0-93.2) during treatment (p<0.0006). prevalence's of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae also decreased significantly. fifteen of 214 isolates (7%) of s. aureus were macrolide resistant before treatment, increasing to 95 of 181 isolates (52.5%) during treatment (p<0.001). macrolide resistant strains were found in 3 of 44 s. aureus colonized patients before treatment and in 11 of 25 patients at some time during treatment (p<0.03), all belonging to different phage types. first resistant s. aureus isolate was isolated after a median treatment duration of 1.5 years (range 0.3-2.9). no mrsa were isolated. only 1 macrolide resistant isolate of m. catarrhalis was found during treatment. no macrolide resistance was found in h. influenzae or s. pneumoniae. conclusion: long-term, low-dose treatment with azithromycin in cf patients leads to reduced prevalence of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae, but increased macrolide resistance in s. aureus. reduction in the prevalence of s. aureus will make increasing macrolide resistance clinically insignificant in these patients.
design, synthesis and in vitro microbiological evaluation of 6,6-dimethyl-7,9-diaryl-1,2,4,8-tetraazaspiro[4.5]decan-3-thiones--a new series of 'tailor-made' compounds.
some novel 'tailor-made' compounds, 6,6-dimethyl-7,9-diaryl-1,2,4,8-tetraazaspiro[4.5]decan-3-thiones 23-27 have been studied for their in vitro antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, beta-heamolytic streptococcus, vibreo cholerae, salmonella typhii, shigella felxneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and anti-fungal activity against aspergillus flavus, mucor, rhizopus and microsporum gypsuem. compounds 24 and 25 exerted potent antibacterial activity against s. aureus, beta-h. streptococcus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa whereas all compounds 23-27 exerted strong in vitro antifungal activity against a. flavus, mucor and rhizopus.
[activity of tigecycline against pathogen bacteria isolated in respiratory infectious disease in europe. test study 2004-2007].
tigecycline (tgc), a semisynthetic glycylcycline, has a documented activity on gram+ and gram- pathogens including oxacillin-resistant (mrsa) and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae. tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) is an international surveillance study designed to assess the in vitro activity of tgc and 11 comparators against a range of important clinical pathogens from both the community and the hospital. the aim of this study was to assess efficacy of tgc, using this database, against pathogens implicated in community or hospital pneumonia and sinusitis. a total of 4163 isolates were consecutively collected in 21 european countries during three years (2004-2007). in all center, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determinated with the same microscan panel (dade-behring). tigecycline exhibited a good activity against respiratory pathogens, with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa. hundred percent of cocci gram+ (streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus sp.) and 100% of haemophilus sp. are inhibited with 0.5 mg/l, without effect of an associated beta-lactam resistance mechanism. tgc is active in vitro on 89% of enterobacteriaceae, with mic 90 less or equal to 2mg/l. eighty-nine percent of enterobacter sp. and 77% of serratia sp. are susceptible with range of mic 90 from 2 to 4 mg/l. these interesting results obtained in vitro are to be strengthened by clinical studies.
new organoselenium compounds active against pathogenic bacteria, fungi and viruses.
different n-substituted benzisoselenazol-3(2h)-ones, analogues of ebselen were designed as new antiviral and antimicrobial agents. we report their synthesis, chemical properties as well as study on biological activity against broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus simulans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans, aspergillus niger) and viruses (herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1), encephalomyocarditis virus (emcv), vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv)), in vitro. most of them exhibited high activity against viruses (hsv-1, emcv) and gram-positive bacteria strains (s. aureus, s. simulans), while their activity against gram-negative bacteria strains (e. coli, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae) was substantially lower. some of tested compounds were active against yeast c. albicans and filamentous fungus a. niger.
metal based isatin-derived sulfonamides: their synthesis, characterization, coordination behavior and biological activity.
some isatin derived sulfonamides and their transition metal [co(ii), cu(ii), ni(ii), zn(ii)] complexes have been synthesized and characterized. the structure of synthesized compounds and their nature of bonding have been inferred on the basis of their physical (magnetic susceptibility and conductivity measurements), analytical (elemental analyses) and spectral (ir, (1)h nmr and (13)c nmr) properties. an octahedral geometry has been suggested for co(ii), ni(ii) and zn(ii) and square-planar for cu(ii) complexes. in order to assess the antibacterial and antifungal behavior, the ligands and their metal(ii) complexes were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against four gram-negative species, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi and two gram-positive species, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis and, for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glaberata. in vitro cytotoxic properties of all the compounds were also studied against artemia salina by brine shrimp bioassay. the results of average antibacterial/antifungal activity showed that zinc(ii) complexes were found to be the most active against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the other metal complexes.
antibacterial activity of stem and leaf extract ofkedrostis foetidissima (jacq.)  cogn.
the present study aimed at evaluating the antimicrobial activity of chloroform extracts of stem and leaf of kedrostis foetidissima (jacq.) cogn. (cucurbitaceae) against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae. was carried out using agar disc diffusion technique. the results revealed that the chloroform extract of stem presented the highest zone of inhibition against pseudomonas aeruginosa others show significant zone of inhibition.
extracellular gelsolin binds lipoteichoic acid and modulates cellular response to proinflammatory bacterial wall components.
the various functions of gelsolin in extracellular compartments are not yet clearly defined but include actin scavenging and antiinflammatory effects. gelsolin was recently reported to bind endotoxin (lps) from various gram-negative bacteria with high affinity. in this study we investigate whether gelsolin also interacts with bacterial wall molecules of gram-positive bacteria such as lipoteichoic acid (lta) and whether gelsolin's interaction with bacterial lipids from gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria affects their cellular inflammatory responses. a peptide based on the ppi binding site of gelsolin (160-169) binds purified lta at the same molecular ratio that it binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. the od of recombinant human plasma gelsolin was found to decrease following the addition of purified lta, and the binding of gelsolin to lta inhibits f-actin depolymerization by gelsolin. simultaneously, the ability of lta to activate translocation of nf-kappab, e-selectin expression, and adhesion of neutrophils to lta-treated human aortic endothelial cells was compromised by gelsolin. gelsolin was able to partially inhibit lps- or lta-induced release of il-8 from human neutrophils but was unable to prevent gram-positive bacillus subtilis or gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa growth and had no effect on the antibacterial activity of the cathelicidin-derived antibacterial peptide ll37. these data suggest that extracellular gelsolin is involved in the host immune recognition of lta or lps following release of these molecules from the bacterial outer membrane during cell division or attack by drugs and immune components.
effect of antibiotic co-administration on young and mature biofilms of cystic fibrosis clinical isolates: the importance of the biofilm model.
the prognosis of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) has improved dramatically over the last three decades although the majority of patients still die in early adulthood. infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa has generally been associated with declining lung function and increased mortality in patients. this study aimed to investigate the in vitro activity of tobramycin/clarithromycin combination on biofilms of clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa, meticillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, and burkholderia cepacia. first, the impact of antibiotic co-administration on biofilms at different stages of maturation, i.e. during early formation and on 24-h-old and 12-day-old biofilms, was compared. the 24-h-old biofilms were found to behave differently compared with those aged 12 days, which were more resistant to antibiotics. a kinetic study of antibiotic co-administration twice a day for 9 days on 12-day-old p. aeruginosa biofilms was then performed to simulate the effect of treatment of cf patients by inhaled tobramycin through aerosolisation (tobi). the results obtained support a synergistic activity of tobramycin/clarithromycin combination on biofilms of p. aeruginosa py02 and pa01, with a logarithmic bacterial decrease of 3.37 and 3.96, respectively. on the other hand, increased resistance to each of the antibacterial agents used alone was observed. this study highlights the importance of the biofilm stage for in vitro investigations and enabled the development of an in vitro model of mature biofilm that is more appropriate to mimic in vivo conditions in cf patients.
lipids including cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate contribute to the inherent antibacterial activity of human nasal fluid.
mucosal surfaces provide first-line defense against microbial invasion through their complex secretions. the antimicrobial activities of proteins in these secretions have been well delineated, but the contributions of lipids to mucosal defense have not been defined. we found that normal human nasal fluid contains all major lipid classes (in micrograms per milliliter), as well as lipoproteins and apolipoprotein a-i. the predominant less polar lipids were myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid, cholesterol, and cholesteryl palmitate, cholesteryl linoleate, and cholesteryl arachidonate. normal human bronchioepithelial cell secretions exhibited a similar lipid composition. removal of less-polar lipids significantly decreased the inherent antibacterial activity of nasal fluid against pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was in part restored after replenishing the lipids. furthermore, lipids extracted from nasal fluid exerted direct antibacterial activity in synergism with the antimicrobial human neutrophil peptide hnp-2 and liposomal formulations of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate were active against p. aeruginosa at physiological concentrations as found in nasal fluid and exerted inhibitory activity against other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. these data suggest that host-derived lipids contribute to mucosal defense. the emerging concept of host-derived antimicrobial lipids unveils novel roads to a better understanding of the immunology of infectious diseases.
emerging pathogens in cystic fibrosis: ten years of follow-up in a cohort of patients.
in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), there is an increasing incidence of some uncommon respiratory pathogens, such as burkholderia cepacia complex (bcc), stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and achromobacter xylosoxidans. in order to evaluate the prevalence and the clinical impact of these pathogens, we retrospectively studied a total of 109 patients followed in our center from 1996 to 2006 and reviewed the results of 1,550 sputum samples. the isolation of pseudomonas aeruginosa slightly decreased over the observed decade, whereas staphylococcus aureus exhibited an irregular trend. infection with bcc reached a peak in 1998 and successively decreased to a stable 4%. s. maltophilia and a. xylosoxidans were the real emerging pathogens, since first isolation occurred in 2004; however, the percentage of infected patients remained low (7% and 3.2%, respectively) through the years. in conclusion, in our center for cf, the reduced prevalence of p. aeruginosa over the last decade has been associated with a concurrent reduction of infections by bcc and, as compared to other centers in italy, europe, and the us, with a low incidence of emerging pathogens such as s. maltophilia and a. xylosoxidans.
synergistic antibacterial effect between silybin and n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in clinical pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates.
silybin is a composition of the silymarin group as a hepatoprotective agent, and  it exhibits various biological activities, including an antibacterial activity. in this study, the effects of a combination of silybin with n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dccd) against clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated. in the results of susceptibility assay, silybin showed more potent antibacterial activity in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) than in p. aeruginosa, but dccd significantly increased the antibacterial activity of silybin in p. aeruginosa. the antibacterial activity of silybin was affected by the strong action of multidrug-resistant pumps rather than by a permeable disruption of lipopolysaccharide and silybin showed a remarkable synergistic activity in combination with some antibiotic agents against drug-resistant bacteria. therefore, silybin has a potential as a combination therapeutic agent for treatment of infectious diseases by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy. part 1: a general view of antibacterial susceptibility.
the japanese society of chemotherapy (jsc) conducted the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens during the period from january to august 2006. with the cooperation of 32 medical institutions throughout japan, a total of 924 strains belonging to seven clinically relevant bacterial species were collected from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections (rtis). antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 887 evaluable strains (205 staphylococcus aureus, 200 streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 streptococcus pyogenes, 165 haemophilus influenzae, 91 moraxella catarrhalis, 74 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 143 pseudomonas aeruginosa) to 42 antibacterial agents was conducted at the central laboratory of the research center for anti-infective drugs of the kitasato institute, according to recommendations issued by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). the antibacterial agents employed were 25 beta-lactams, three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including one azalide and one ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, five fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone. the incidence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 63.4%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediately resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp) and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were 35.0% and 4.0%, respectively. among h. influenzae, 21.2% of the strains were found to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (abpc)-intermediately resistant (blnai), 29.1% to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing abpc-resistant (blnar), and 4.8% to be beta-lactamaseproducing abpc-resistant (blpar) strains. the incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae was 2.7% (2 of 74 strains). three (2.1%) of the 143 p. aeruginosa strains were found to be metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing, including 1 (0.7%) multidrug-resistant strain. through the nationwide surveillance, we obtained fundamental antimicrobial susceptibility data of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens in adult rti to various antibacterial agents. these data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies, as well as for investigations to control antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
stability and antibacterial potency of ceftazidime and vancomycin eyedrops reconstituted in bss against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.
purpose: we aimed to study the stability and the in vitro antibacterial potency of ceftazidime and vancomycin eyedrops against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, respectively, under different storage temperatures and light conditions. methods: solutions of ceftazidime 50 mg/ml and vancomycin 50 mg/ml were prepared by reconstituting with balanced salt solution (bss) and stored at 4 degrees c and at 24 degrees c with and without exposure to light. the minimum bactericidal concentrations against p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were measured to evaluate the antimicrobial potency over a 4-week period. changes in the ph values and physical characteristics of the solutions were recorded over the same period of time. results: the antibacterial potency of ceftazidime decreased significantly from days 3 and 7 onwards at storage temperatures of 24 degrees c and 4 degrees c, respectively, but was not affected by light exposure. the ph value progressed from acidic to alkaline, peaking at day 3, in all solutions. the antibacterial potency of vancomycin remained stable during the 4-week period, but its ph showed a slight progression from acidic to less acidic, in all solutions. conclusions: ceftazidime eyedrops in bss appear to remain effective against p. aeruginosa for > or = 7 days when stored at 4 degrees c, but were less effective when stored at 24 degrees c. loss of antibacterial potency coincides with the appearance of visual and olfactory signs of degradation. the transient rise in ph at day 3 is a matter of possible concern, however, as it may affect patient tolerance. by contrast, vancomycin eyedrops in bss can be safely used for > or = 4 weeks, stored at either 4 degrees c or 24 degrees c.
antibacterial and antifungal properties of human cerumen.
objective: to assess the antibacterial and antifungal properties of human cerumen by studying its effect on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, esherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. materials and methods: cerumen samples were collected from 75 normal, healthy subjects aged from seven to 80 years, without ear pathology, who attended the ear, nose and throat out-patient clinic of the university malaya medical center from may 2006 to october 2006. of these 75 samples, 31 had no growth when cultured on nutrient agar. inhibition studies on these 31 samples were performed for staphylococcus aureus (american type culture collection (atcc) 25923), esherichia coli (atcc 25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853) and candida albicans. nutrient agar was used to conserve all three bacterial strains and sabouraud dextrose agar was used for candida albicans. results: a decrease in staphylococcus aureus growth was observed for 27 of the 31 samples. all 31 samples induced decreased growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, while 29 induced decreased growth of candida albicans. however, only four samples induced decreased growth of escherichia coli. conclusions: cerumen was demonstrated to have potential antimicrobial effects on strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans.
surface antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of incorporated polyethylenimine nanoparticles.
the antimicrobial effect and biocompatibility of insoluble cross-linked quaternary ammonium polyethylenimine (pei) nanoparticles incorporated at 1 or 2%w/w in a resin composite were assayed. the antimicrobial effect against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli was tested using the direct contact test (dct), agar diffusion test (adt) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). biocompatibility was tested by assessing macrophage viability, and tnfalpha secretion. samples incorporating 2%w/w nanoparticles inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains tested. reducing the amount of the added nanoparticles to 1%w/w resulted in complete inhibition of s. aureus and e. faecalis, and decreased growth of s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and e. coli (p<0.0001). the dct results were confirmed by sem. however, adt showed no inhibition halo in all test bacteria, indicating the antimicrobial nanoparticles are not diffusing into the agar milieu. biocompatibility tests revealed macrophage viability, and tnfalpha secretion was not altered by the presence of the nanoparticles in the resin. incorporation of pei nanoparticles in a resin composite had a long lasing antimicrobial effect against a wide range of bacteria with no measured effect on biocompatibility.
antimicrobial activity of essential oil and major constituents of salvia chloroleuca.
the aerial parts of salvia chloroleuca were collected at full flowering stage at  shahrestanak (tehran province of iran). the essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary gc and gc-ms. thirty-four components were identified, representing 98.5% of the total oil. beta-pinene (10.6%), alpha-pinene (9.0%), beta-caryophyllene (9.0%), 1,8-cineole (9.0%) and carvacrol (7.9%) were the main components. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of s. chloroleuca was studied against seven gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus niger); the disc diffusion method and mic values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity.
in vitro inhibitory effect of cranberry (vaccinium macrocarpom ait.) juice on pathogenic microorganisms.
the purpose of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of cranberry juice on pathogenic microorganisms. the microorganisms analyzed were escherichia coli from patients with urinary infections, salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. the disc method was used to determine the sensitivity of bacteria to cranberry juice (cj, both concentrated and diluted). a lawn of 10(6) cfu/ml was grown on agar surfaces in petri dishes and on whatman discs that had been previously saturated with cj and cj : water 1 : 1 to 1 : 50 juice solutions had been placed on the discs, which were cultured and incubated. the results indicated that s. aureus was more susceptible to cranberry juice inhibition than the other microorganisms. l. monocytogenes was the most resistant to the inhibitory action of cranberry juice, showing a significant difference from the inhibition of p. aeruginosa, uropathogenic e. coli, salmonella spp., and s. aureus. this study also demonstrated that the inhibitory activity of cranberry juice for e. coli took place up to a dilution of 1 : 20.
in vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
background: the antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. objective: to investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. methods: the activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. the validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. the inhibition zones of the discs were measured. results: mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on e. coli, whereas they had no effects on p. aeruginosa. lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, s. pyogenes and e. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% showed no activity on e. faecalis and inhibited s. pyogenes only at double doses. it was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. conclusion: in the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.
challenge testing the lactoperoxidase system against a range of bacteria using different activation agents.
lactoperoxidase (lp) exerts antimicrobial effects in combination with h(2)o(2) and either thiocyanate (scn(-)) or a halide (e.g., i(-)). garlic extract in the presence of ethanol has also been used to activate the lp system. this study aimed to determine the effects of 3 lp activation systems (lp+scn(-)+h(2)o(2); lp+i(-)+h(2)o(2); lp + garlic extract + ethanol) on the growth and activity of 3 test organisms (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus). sterilized milk was used as the reaction medium, and the growth pattern of the organisms and a range of keeping quality (kq) indicators (ph, titratable acidity, ethanol stability, clot on boiling) were monitored during storage at the respective optimum growth temperature for each organism. the lp+i(-)+ h(2)o(2) system reduced bacterial counts below the detection limit shortly after treatment for all 3 organisms, and no bacteria could be detected for the duration of the experiment (35 to 55 h). the kq data confirmed that the milk remained unspoiled at the end of the experiments. the lp + garlic extract + ethanol system, on the other hand, had no effect on the growth or kq with p. aeruginosa, but showed a small retardation of growth of the other 2 organisms, accompanied by small increases (5 to 10 h) in kq. the effects of the lp+scn(-)+h(2)o(2) system were intermediate between those of the other 2 systems and differed between organisms. with p. aeruginosa, the system exerted total inhibition within 10 h of incubation, but the bacteria regained viability after a further 5 h, following a logarithmic growth curve. this was reflected in the kq indicators, which implied an extension of 15 h. with the other 2 bacterial species, lp+scn(-)+h(2)o(2) exerted an obvious inhibitory effect, giving a lag phase in the growth curve of 5 to 10 h and kq extension of 10 to 15 h. when used in combination, i(-) and scn(-) displayed negative synergy.
copper and quaternary ammonium cations exert synergistic bactericidal and antibiofilm activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
biofilms are slimy aggregates of microbes that are likely responsible for many chronic infections as well as for contamination of clinical and industrial environments. pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent hospital pathogen that is well known for its ability to form biofilms that are recalcitrant to many different antimicrobial treatments. we have devised a high-throughput method for testing combinations of antimicrobials for synergistic activity against biofilms, including those formed by p. aeruginosa. this approach was used to look for changes in biofilm susceptibility to various biocides when these agents were combined with metal ions. this process identified that cu(2+) works synergistically with quaternary ammonium compounds (qacs; specifically benzalkonium chloride, cetalkonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, myristalkonium chloride, and polycide) to kill p. aeruginosa biofilms. in some cases, adding cu(2+) to qacs resulted in a 128-fold decrease in the biofilm minimum bactericidal concentration compared to that for single-agent treatments. in combination, these agents retained broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that also eradicated biofilms of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica serovar cholerasuis, and pseudomonas fluorescens. to investigate the mechanism of action, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to show that cu(2+) and qacs do not interact in aqueous solutions, suggesting that each agent exerts microbiological toxicity through independent biochemical routes. additionally, cu(2+) and qacs, both alone and in combination, reduced the activity of nitrate reductases, which are enzymes that are important for normal biofilm growth. collectively, the results of this study indicate that cu(2+) and qacs are effective combinations of antimicrobials that may be used to kill bacterial biofilms.
potent in vitro activity of tomopenem (cs-023) against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
tomopenem (formerly cs-023) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with broad-spectrum coverage of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. its antibacterial activity against european clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa was compared with those of imipenem and meropenem. the mics of tomopenem against mrsa and p. aeruginosa at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited were 8 and 4 microg/ml, respectively, and were equal to or more than fourfold lower than those of imipenem and meropenem. the antibacterial activity of tomopenem against mrsa was correlated with a higher affinity for the penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2a. its activity against laboratory mutants of p. aeruginosa with (i) overproduction of chromosomally coded ampc beta-lactamase; (ii) overproduction of the multidrug efflux pumps mexab-oprm, mexcd-oprj, and mexef-oprn; (iii) deficiency in oprd; and (iv) various combinations of ampc overproduction, mexab-oprm overproduction, and oprd deficiency were tested. the increases in the mic of tomopenem against each single mutant compared with that against its parent strain were within a fourfold range. tomopenem exhibited antibacterial activity against all mutants, with an observed mic range of 0.5 to 8 microg/ml. these results suggest that the antibacterial activity of tomopenem against the clinical isolates of mrsa and p. aeruginosa should be ascribed to its high affinity for pbp 2a and its activity against the mutants of p. aeruginosa, respectively.
control of bacterial biofilms with marine alkaloid derivatives.
bacterial biofilms are defined as a community of surface-attached bacteria that are protected by an extracellular matrix of biomolecules. we have recently reported the synthesis of a small molecule, denoted tage, based on the natural product bromoageliferin and demonstrated that tage has anti-biofilm activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. herein we demonstrate that tage: (1) does not have selective toxicity against cells within the biofilm state, (2) will inhibit biofilm development under flow conditions, indicating that the cv staining protocol correlates with the ability to be active under biomimetic conditions, and (3) will disperse preformed p. aeruginosa biofilms. we also present preliminary toxicity work that indicates that tage is devoid of cytotoxicity in rat and mice cell lines. advanced derivatives of tage have generated compounds shown to be exceedingly effective as biofilm inhibitors against the gamma-proteobacteria in this study (p. aeruginosa strains pao1, pa14, pdo300, and acinetobacter baumannii). tage derivatives also possessed anti-biofilm activity against the beta-proteobacterium bordetella bronchiseptica (rb50) and the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus;tage derivatives inhibited the formation of biofilms, however, some of this activity is attributed to microbicidal activity. the tage derivatives presented in this study, however, do not disperse pre-formed biofilms with the same efficiency as tage.
growth inhibition of a spectrum of bacterial and fungal pathogens by sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate product found in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables.
in addition to its documented antitumor effects, previous in vitro and in vivo infectivity experiments have shown that sulforaphane (sfn), an isothiocyanate compound found abundantly in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, inhibits the growth of the bacterial pathogen helicobacter pylori. no recent evidence exists, however, on the possible microbial activity of sfn against a broader range of microorganisms, including those that may develop resistance to conventional antibiotics. the aim of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility patterns of sfn against a wide variety of bacterial and fungal pathogens. sensitivity testing was done on 28 different microbial species using a modified kirby-bauer disk-diffusion method and results were interpreted based on guidelines established by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the broad-spectrum antibiotic, ceftriaxone (ctx), was used as a positive control for antimicrobial inhibition. it was found that 23 out of 28 different microbial species were inhibited by sfn with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 1-4 microg/ml. five pathogens--pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolates and candida albicans--were considered resistant to sfn, having mics >or= 16-32 microg/ml. these findings suggest that, with the dual action of sfn against a select group of microorganisms and its ability to inhibit tumor growth, sfn (or the consumption of sfn-containing vegetables) might be especially helpful in preventing certain types of infections in both cancer and non-cancer patients.
antimicrobial activity of cuticle and outer eggshell protein extracts from three  species of domestic birds.
1. the eggshell cuticle is the proteinaceous outermost layer of the eggshell which regulates water exchange and protects against entry of micro-organisms. in this study, we investigated the hypothesis that the cuticle may also reduce microbial contamination by providing a chemical defence. 2. outer eggshell and cuticle protein was extracted from domestic chicken (gallus gallus), duck (anas platyrhynchos) and goose (anser anser) eggs by hcl and urea treatment, respectively. antimicrobial activity of the extracts against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was evaluated. 3. c-type lysozyme, ovotransferrin and ovocalyxin-32 were identified in all extracts by western blotting. all extracts from all species demonstrated lysozyme enzymatic activity. immobilised c-type lysozyme retained some enzymatic activity. protein extracts demonstrated activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis suggesting the action of antimicrobial proteins in addition to lysozyme. 4. the results suggest that the antimicrobial outer eggshell and cuticle proteins present in a number of avian species may be a mechanism which enhances avian reproductive success.
interactions of antimicrobial compounds with cross-linking agents of alginate dressings.
objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activities of calcium ions and other cross-linking agents of alginate dressings, as well as their compatibility with commonly used topical antimicrobials. methods: the antimicrobial activities of cross-linking agents and antimicrobials (five antibiotics and four antiseptics) were evaluated by the broth dilution method. the interactions between individual cross-linking agents and antimicrobials were evaluated using the chequerboard test against common skin pathogens, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. results: from the mic determined, antibiotics were the most active, followed by the antiseptics and cross-linking agents. calcium ions, which are commonly used to cross-link alginate, exhibited very weak antimicrobial activity and higher fractional inhibitory concentration than the other cross-linking agents. the use of calcium and gentamicin resulted in antagonism against s. aureus. in contrast, aluminium, zinc and copper ions exhibited higher antimicrobial activities but insignificant interactions with the antimicrobials. conclusions: commonly used topical antimicrobials that are active against the skin pathogens s. aureus and p. aeruginosa could be potentially incompatible with calcium alginate dressings. copper, zinc and aluminium ions are more suitable cross-linking agents for alginate as they do not show antagonism with the antimicrobials and could impart antimicrobial property to the resultant dressing.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of plants in acute otitis externa.
acute otitis externa is an inflammation of the outer auditory meatus, and according to popular saying, medicinal plant extracts can be used in its treatment. aim: to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the following plants: aleolanthus suaveolens; caryophyllus aromaticus; cymbopogon citratus; matricaria chamomila; pithecellobium avaremotemo; plectranthus amboinicus and ruta graveolens on the germs that cause otitis externa. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration of extracts and oils from these plants was obtained from otitis externa samples. results: staphylococcus aureus in 10 cultures, pseudomonas aeruginosa in 8, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus together in 5 cultures and candida albicans and candida krusei in 4 cultures. p. aeruginosa was resistant to all oils and extracts tested; extracts from a. suaveolens, p. avaremotemo and r. graveolens were inactive; the essential oil from c. aromaticus and m. chamomila were active against 3 strains of s. aureus and the candida strains; seven of the s. aureus strains were sensitive to the p. amboinicus extract; however, the oil was inactive against 4 s. aureus strains and the candida strains were sensitive to the r. graveolens essential oil. conclusion: depending on the etiological agent, some plants presented satisfactory results, however we still need more detailed studies in order to better use these plants.
antimicrobial activity of 2,5-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone from embelia schimperi.
chromatographic separation of an ethyl acetate extract from embelia schimperi led to the isolation of a new compound identified as 2,5-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (1) on the basis of spectroscopic and physical data. the plant's crude extract and pure compound 1 were assayed for in vitro antimicrobial activity against clinical strains of salmonella spp., proteus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, cryptococcus neoformans, shigella dysentriae and staphylococcus aureus. disc diffusion method was used and zones of inhibition, after respective incubation periods, were used to quantify antimicrobial activity. standard antibiotics namely: augmentin, cotrimoxazole, gentamycin, tetracycline and lyncomycin were used as controls. the crude extract was inactive while the pure compound 1 showed significant activities against salmonella spp., proteus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, cryptococcus neoformans, shigella dysentriae and staphylococcus aureus with zones of inhibition ranging from 10-20 mm. the most sensitive microorganism was p aeruginosa while c. neoformans was insensitive to both the crude extract and compound 1.
antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
beneficial effect of antibiotics on ciliary beat frequency of human nasal epithelial cells exposed to bacterial toxins.
in the present study, we explored whether the cilio-inhibitory effect induced by  toxins derived from bacterial infections could be compensated for by a cilio-stimulatory effect of antibiotics. human nasal epithelial cells (hnec) expressing beating cilia were grown as monolayers. ciliary beat frequency (cbf) was determined using an inverted microscope coupled with a high-speed digital camera. clarithromycin and neomycin did not influence ciliary activity. bacitracin, clindamycin, gramicidin and roxithromycin increased cbf significantly: by 50 +/- 12%, 54 +/- 16%, 31 +/- 16% and 31 +/- 18%, respectively. a 30 min exposure to staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin b (seb) and pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (pal) decreased cbf significantly, by 37 +/- 16 and 28 +/- 12%, respectively. in contrast with exposure to the toxin alone, co-incubation of the nasal monolayer cells with pal and bacitracin or clindamycin did not result in a decrease in cbf after 30 and 60 min. the effect of seb could be compensated for by bacitracin but not by clindamycin. after a 12 h preincubation period with seb, co-incubation with either bacitracin or clindamycin resulted in the complete recovery of cbf. this study suggests that topical antibiotic treatment of nasal infections could result in a dual positive effect, namely treatment of the bacterial infection and recovery of ciliary activity.
new potent antimicrobial peptides from the venom of polistinae wasps and their analogs.
four new peptides of the mastoparan family, characterized recently in the venom of three neotropical social wasps collected in the dominican republic, polistes major major, polistes dorsalis dorsalis and mischocyttarus phthisicus were synthesized and tested for antimicrobial potency against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli (e.c.) and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for hemolytic and mast cells degranulation activities. as these peptides possess strong antimicrobial activity (minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values against bacillus subtillis and e.c. in the range of 5-40 microm), we prepared 40 of their analogs to correlate biological activities, especially antimicrobial, with the net positive charge, hydrophobicity, amphipathicity, peptide length, amino acid substitutions at different positions of the peptide chain, n-terminal acylation and c-terminal deamidation. circular dichroism spectra of the peptides measured in the presence of trifluoroethanol or sds showed that the peptides might adopt alpha-helical conformation in such anisotropic environments.
predictors of mucoid pseudomonas colonization in cystic fibrosis patients.
rationale: chronic mucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa within the airway in cystic fibrosis (cf) patients can determine prognosis. understanding the risk factors of mucoid p. aeruginosa acquisition may change how we deliver care. this study aims to evaluate whether presence of risk factors reported to predict disease severity including gender, cftr genotype, bacterial organisms in airway cultures, and serum levels of vitamins a and e, albumin, c-reactive protein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and immunoglobulins increased the risk of mucoid p. aeruginosa acquisition. methods: primary endpoint was age at first transition from negative to positive culture for mucoid p. aeruginosa. cox proportional hazards regression with time-dependent covariates examined development of mucoid p. aeruginosa infection and its association with longitudinally measured serum biomarkers, pulmonary function, and culture results for other organisms. results: median ages at cf diagnosis and at first culture were 0.55 and 5.7 years, respectively. median number of cultures/patient was 17. of the 323 subjects, 150 developed mucoid p. aeruginosa during a median 8.1 years' follow-up. in multivariate analysis, gender (relative hazard [rh] 0.55 for male vs. female, p = 0.001), number of df508 alleles (rh 1.66 for 1 or 2 vs. 0, p = 0.04), fev(1) % (rh 1.16 for 10% decrease, p = 0.008), and most recent staphylococcus aureus status (rh 0.24 for positive vs. negative, p < 0.0001) remained statistically significant. conclusion: female gender, number of df508 alleles, decreased lung function, and lack of s. aureus on recent sputum culture are important risk factors for early detection of mucoid p. aeruginosa.
the antibacterial and antifungal properties of trappin-2 (pre-elafin) do not depend on its protease inhibitory function.
trappin-2 (also known as pre-elafin) is an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases and is involved in the control of excess proteolysis, especially in inflammatory events, along with the structurally related secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor. secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor has been shown to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, whereas recent data indicate that trappin-2 has antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. in the present study, we tested the antibacterial properties of trappin-2 towards other respiratory pathogens. we found that trappin-2, at concentrations of 5-20 microm, has significant activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis and the pathogenic fungi aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans, in addition to p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. a similar antimicrobial activity was observed with trappin-2 a62d/m63l, a trappin-2 variant that has lost its antiprotease properties, indicating that trappin-2 exerts its antibacterial effects through mechanisms independent from its intrinsic antiprotease capacity. furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of trappin-2 were sensitive to nacl and heparin, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is most probably dependent on its cationic nature. this enables trappin-2 to interact with the membranes of target organisms and disrupt them, as shown by our scanning electron microscopy analyses. thus, trappin-2 not only provides an antiprotease shield, but also may play an important role in the innate defense of the human lungs and mucosae against pathogenic microorganisms.
evaluation of the in-vitro cidal activity and toxicity of a novel peroxygen biocide: 2-butanone peroxide.
the monomer of 2-butanone peroxide is a novel peroxygen derivative with potential use as biocide in the hospital environment. the aim of this study was to test the biocidal activity of different concentrations of the compound against american tissue culture collection strains from 11 different micro-organisms, including bacteria, mycobacteria, spores, fungi and virus, following the european standard guidelines. toxicity tests were also carried out following united states environmental protection agency standards. 2-butanone peroxide exhibited biocidal activity at 0.12% against legionella pneumophila, at 0.5% against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus hirae, and at 1% against staphylococcus aureus after 5 min contact at room temperature. mycobactericidal activity was obtained at 0.5% after 60 min contact at 20 degrees c, and sporicidal activity was obtained at 4% after 60 min at 40 degrees c. good fungicidal (against yeasts and moulds) and virucidal (adenovirus and poliovirus) activities were obtained at 0.5% after 60 min contact. toxicity assessment showed negative results in the acute dermal irritation test, acute eye irritation test and acute oral toxicity test. the skin sensitisation test was negative. the safety profile in the toxicity tests and the basic cidal activity against the strains tested suggest that 2-butanone peroxide in the control of hospital infections.
melatonin as an antibiotic: new insights into the actions of this ubiquitous molecule.
the incidence of serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria has been increasing rapidly worldwide despite advances in antibacterial therapy in the last two decades. among multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii are of great importance, because they have emerged as primary nosocomial pathogens in hospital outbreaks. in this study, we investigated whether melatonin has antibacterial effects against these microorganisms in vitro. the minimum inhibitory concentration of melatonin was determined using a standard microdilution method at 24 and 48 hr. melatonin inhibited microbial growth at both 24 and 48 hr; but results showed that melatonin had antibacterial effects against these microorganisms after 48 hr of incubation in lower doses [concentrations between 31.25 to 125 microg/ml (0.13-0.53 mm)]. also, it was determined that melatonin has a more potent antimicrobial effect on gram-negative microorganism. among possible mechanisms, it is concluded that melatonin showed antibacterial effects by reducing intracellular substrates.
optimized dosage and frequency of cefozopran for patients with febrile neutropenia based on population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis.
objectives: to establish a cefozopran (a fourth-generation cephem) population pharmacokinetic model using patient data and use it to explore alternative dosage regimens that could optimize the currently used dosing regimen to achieve higher likelihood of pharmacodynamic exposure against pathogenic bacteria. methods: we conducted a prospective clinical trial of cefozopran for haematological patients with febrile neutropenia (fn). twenty-two patients (30 episodes) were selected to receive intravenous cefozopran every 8 h on a daily basis. we gathered concentration data and performed the nonmem program. the monte carlo simulation was performed to assess the pharmacodynamic exposure based on the population pharmacokinetics and mic. results: the nonmem program demonstrated that a two-compartment model provided a best fit for the data, that is, cl of 4.62 (l/h), v1 of 10.3 (l), q of 4.47 (l/h), and v2 of 4.48 (l). on the basis of the japanese national surveillance findings for pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, viridans group streptococci, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, monte carlo simulation data showed that probability of target attainment(t>mic = 70%) is 67% to 97% for dosing every 8 h, and 48% to 88% for dosing every 12 h. for the patients in whom the efficacy of cefozopran could be evaluated, 17 of 22 patients (77.2%) survived the episode of fn without requiring further antibacterial treatment. conclusions: our study proved that monte carlo simulation based on population pharmacokinetics can determine optimized dosage and method. the optimal regimen for this cephem was found to be three times daily.
purification of a lectin from eugenia uniflora l. seeds and its potential antibacterial activity.
aims: the aim of this work was to analyse the antimicrobial properties of a purified lectin from eugenia uniflora l. seeds. methods and results: the e. uniflora lectin (eunisl) was isolated from the seed extract and purified by ion-exchange chromatography in deae-sephadex with a purification factor of 11.68. the purified lectin showed a single band on denaturing electrophoresis, with a molecular mass of 67 kda. eunisl agglutinated rabbit and human erythrocytes with a higher specificity for rabbit erythrocytes. the haemagglutination was not inhibited by the tested carbohydrates but glycoproteins exerted a strong inhibitory action. the lectin proved to be thermo resistant with the highest stability at ph 6.5 and divalent ions did not affect its activity. eunisl demonstrated a remarkable nonselective antibacterial activity. eunisl strongly inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella sp. with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 1.5 microg ml(-1), and moderately inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, streptococcus sp. and escherichia coli with a mic of 16.5 microg ml(-1). conclusions: eunisl was found to be effective against bacteria. significance and impact of the study: the strong antibacterial activity of the studied lectin indicates a high potential for clinical microbiology and therapeutic applications.
antibacterial activity of honey from stingless honeybees (hymenoptera; apidae; meliponinae).
the aim of the study was to examine antibacterial activity of the honey of stingless honeybees (meliponinae). an agar well diffusion assay demonstrated that many honey samples of stingless honeybees inhibited the growth of test strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa; moreover, they exhibited non-peroxide antibacterial activity against those strains. this is the first time that non-peroxide antimicrobial activity of honey from a number of species of stingless honeybees has been demonstrated. these antibacterial activities appear to be powerful, even when compared to those of"manuka honey" from apinae honeybees.
copper(ii) complexes with sparfloxacin and nitrogen-donor heterocyclic ligands: structure-activity relationship.
three novel neutral mononuclear copper(ii) complexes of the third-generation quinolone antibacterial drug sparfloxacin in the presence of a nitrogen donor heterocyclic ligand 2,2'-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2'-dipyridylamine have been prepared and characterized physicochemically and spectroscopically. the resultant complexes are of the type cu(sparfloxacinato)(n-donor)cl. copper(ii) is pentacoordinate having a distorted square pyramidal geometry. molecular modeling calculations have been performed in order to propose the lowest energy model structure of the complexes. the interaction of the complexes with calf-thymus dna has been investigated with diverse spectroscopic techniques and has shown that the complexes can bind to calf-thymus dna by the intercalative mode. the antimicrobial activity of the complexes has been tested on three different microorganisms. the cu(sparfloxacinato)(n-donor)cl complexes are among the most active ones against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, when compared to the other corresponding copper-quinolone complexes studied by our group and their antimicrobial activity is increased in the order bipyam<bipy=phen. we have also shown that two of the cu(sparfloxacinato)(n-donor)cl complexes have decreased the viability of human leukemia cells hl-60 in a time-dependent manner.
in vitro antibacterial activity of dx-619, a novel des-f (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in china.
the aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of dx-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in china. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of antimicrobials were determined by a clsi recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were examined by the broth dilution method. time-kill curves against representative isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. dx-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci. the mic(90)s of dx-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. the mic(90)s of dx-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. the mic(90)s of dx-619 against enterobacteriaceae (except for escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/l, which were comparable to other comparators. mbcs and time-kill curves showed that dx-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. there was no significant inoculum effect on mics. but the activities of dx-619 against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic ph and human serum. dx-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including gram-positive cocci, such as s. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
bacterial infections in burn patients at a burn hospital in iran.
background & objective: the major challenge for a burn team is nosocomial infection in burn patients, which is known to cause over 50% of burn deaths. most studies on infection in burn patients focus on burn wound infection, whereas other nosocomial infections in these patients are not well described. we undertook this study to determine three types of nosocomial infections viz., burn wound infection, urinary tract infection, and blood stream infection in burn patients in a burn hospital in iran. methods: during the one year period (may 2003 to april 2004), 182 patients were included in this study. blood, urine and wound biopsy samples were taken 7 and 14 days after admission to taleghani burn hospital. isolation and identification of microorganisms was done using the standard procedure. disk diffusion test were performed for all the isolates for antimicrobial susceptibility. results: of the 182 patients, 140 (76.9%) acquired at least one type of infection of the 140, 116 patients (82.8%) were culture positive on day 7 while 24 (17.2%) on 14 days after admission. primary wound infection was most common (72.5%), followed by blood stream (18.6%) and urinary tract infections (8.9 %). the microorganisms causing infections were pseudomonas aeruginosa (37.5%), staphylococcus aureus (20.2%), and acinetobacter baumanni (10.4%). among these isolates p. aeruginosa was found to be 100 per cent resistant to amikacin, gentamicin , carbenicillin, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin and ceftazidime; 58 per cent of s. aureus and 60 per cent of coagulase negative staphylococcus were methicillin resistant. interpretation & conclusion: high prevalence of nosocomial infections and the presence of multidrug resistant bacteria, and methicillin resistant s. aureus in patients at taleghani burn hospital suggest continuous surveillance of burn infections and develop strategies for antimicrobial resistance control and treatment of infectious complications.
an examination of the antibiotic effects of cylindrospermopsin on common gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and the protozoan naegleria lovaniensis.
the importance of the toxin cylindrospermopsin to the function and fitness of the cyanobacteria that produce it remains a matter of conjecture. given that the structure of cylindrospermopsin has commonalities with other antibacterial protein synthesis inhibitors, such as streptomycin, authors tested the possibility that the toxin might act as an antibacterial compound that can kill competing microbes. escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested by the minimal inhibitory concentration method and significant antibacterial activity was only observed at a cylindrospermopsin concentration of 300 microg ml(-1) after exposure for 5 days. no effect on log phase growth of e. coli was observed for this same toxin concentration. protein synthesis was inhibited by cylindrospermopsin in e. coli 70s extracts, reduced by 25% compared with controls when treated with 41.5 microg ml(-1) of the toxin; however, a much greater reduction of 97% was observed for chloramphenicol in the same experiment. naegleria lovaniensis, a phagotrophic protozoan, was more susceptible to cylindrospermopsin, with a decrease in the number of n. lovaniensis plaques after 24-h treatment with 5-50 microg ml(-1) of toxin and an lc(50) of approximately 60 microg ml(-1). given these results, cylindrospermopsin is clearly not antibacterial at concentrations found in environmental waters, nor will it adversely affect n. lovaniensis at these concentrations. for organisms that are able to ingest cylindrospermopsin-producing cells, the response of n. lovaniensis to the toxin suggests that only a few ingested cells would be enough to kill predatory organisms with similar susceptibility.
antibacterial and antifungal properties of polyether impression materials.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal properties of polyether impression materials using the agar diffusion test. three different types of polyether impression materials (p2, penta soft and penta) were tested to determine their ability to inhibit the growth of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans. the areas of inhibition zones were measured visually with a 0.1-mm incremental boley gauge. in all groups, none of the samples of the p2 polyether impression material exhibited antibacterial or antifungal activity against any of the microorganisms. all penta soft and penta samples exhibited antibacterial activity against e. faecalis and s. aureus, and only penta samples exhibited antifungal effect against c. albicans, which decreased progressively as the setting time of the material increased.
interspecific competition and siderophore-mediated cooperation in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
both intra- and interspecific interactions between microbes are likely to play an important role in determining the severity of microbial infections. here, we study the impact of interactions between coinfecting opportunistic pathogens staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa on both phenotypic and genetic changes in a p. aeruginosa social trait, the production of iron-scavenging siderophores. siderophores are facultatively upregulated in response to iron limitation and play a key role in determining the virulence of microbial infections. siderophore production is metabolically expensive to individual producers but benefits the group as a whole because siderophores can be used by all cells in the vicinity with siderophore receptors. hence, populations of siderophore producers can be invaded by nonproducing cheats. previous work has shown that p. aeruginosa can lyse s. aureus, supplying a source of free iron. we therefore hypothesized that the presence of s. aureus might result in facultative downregulation of siderophore production, and in turn, reduced selection for siderophore cheats. we tested this hypothesis by evolving p. aeruginosa in the presence and absence of free iron and s. aureus, in a fully factorial design. iron had the expected effect: siderophore production was downregulated and cheats evolved less readily, but the presence of s. aureus instead increased facultative siderophore production and selection for cheats. this is probably because the s. aureus had the net effect of competing for iron, rather than acting as an iron source. this study demonstrates that interspecific competition can have a marked effect on intraspecific social interactions.
evaluation of phytochemical and antibacterial potential of helicteres isora l. fruits against enteric bacterial pathogens.
antibacterial activities of aqueous, acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts of fruits of helicteres isora (mororphali) were studied. the fruit aqueous extracts of h. isora showed prominent antibacterial activities against e. coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, salmonella typhimurium and proteus vulgaris; moderate activity against enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi and least activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the aqueous extract showed maximal, the ethanol and methanol extract moderate and acetone extracts least antibacterial activities. phytochemical screening revealed the presence of carbohydrates, anthraquinon glycosides, proteins, tannin and phenolic compounds and steroids these antibacterial properties supports its traditional use of fruits of h. isora in the treatment of enteric or diarrhoeal infections.
[microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
background: blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. methods: the species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the severance hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. results: of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, enterococcus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. the proportion of patients with enterococcus faecium and k. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. enterococcus, s. aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. e. coli, enterococcus spp., k. pneumoniae and s. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenemresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii increased. conclusions: e. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and s. aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and k. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. the bacteremia due to enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
biological screening of some turkish medicinal plant extracts for antimicrobial and toxicity activities.
screening of antibacterial activity and toxicity of 22 aqueous plant extracts from 17 turkish plants was conducted. antibacterial activity was performed with six bacteria including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. extracts of tussilago farfara leaves, helichyrsum plicatum flowers, solanum dulcamara aerial parts and urtica dioica leaves gave the best inhibitory activity against s. pyogenes, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. of the 22 plant extracts, 20 extracts displayed toxicity (lc50 was <1000 mg l(-1)) in the brine shrimp bioassay. for radish seed bioassay, two different determinations (root length and seed germination) were performed with a comparison between two concentrations (50,000 mg l(-1) and 10,000 mg l(-1)). at low concentration (10,000 mg l(-1)), s. dulcamara aerial parts and primula vulgaris leaf extracts were observed to inhibit the root length more than the other plant extracts. also, the most inhibitive plant extract for seed germination was obtained with s. dulcamara aerial parts.
in vitro activities of doripenem and six comparator drugs against 423 aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates from infected diabetic foot wounds.
against 182 anaerobe and 241 aerobe strains obtained from diabetic foot infections, doripenem was the most active carbapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(90), 2 microg/ml), more active than imipenem against proteus mirabilis, and ertapenem was more active against escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. the mic(50) and mic(90) values were < or =0.125 microg/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and all streptococci and 0.25/1 for bacteroides fragilis.
broad-spectrum in vitro antibacterial activities of clay minerals against antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens.
objectives: the capacity to properly address the worldwide incidence of infectious diseases lies in the ability to detect, prevent and effectively treat these infections. therefore, identifying and analysing inhibitory agents are worthwhile endeavours in an era when few new classes of effective antimicrobials have been developed. the use of geological nanomaterials to heal skin infections has been evident since the earliest recorded history, and specific clay minerals may prove valuable in the treatment of bacterial diseases, including infections for which there are no effective antibiotics, such as buruli ulcer and multidrug-resistant infections. methods: we have subjected two iron-rich clay minerals, which have previously been used to treat buruli ulcer patients, to broth culture testing of antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria to assess the feasibility of using clay minerals as therapeutic agents. results: one specific mineral, csag02, demonstrated bactericidal activity against pathogenic escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) e. coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium marinum, and a combined bacteriostatic/bactericidal effect against staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and mycobacterium smegmatis, whereas another mineral with similar structure and bulk crystal chemistry, csar02, had no effect on or enhanced bacterial growth. the <0.2 microm fraction of csag02 and csag02 heated to 200 or 550 degrees c retained bactericidal activity, whereas cation-exchanged csag02 and csag02 heated to 900 degrees c no longer killed e. coli. conclusions: our results indicate that specific mineral products have intrinsic, heat-stable antibacterial properties, which could provide an inexpensive treatment against numerous human bacterial infections.
the antimicrobial activity of copper and copper alloys against nosocomial pathogens and mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from healthcare facilities in the western cape: an in-vitro study.
clinical isolates of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, candida albicans and mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb) were tested against copper (cu) and its alloys. stainless steel and polyvinylchloride (pvc) were used as controls. the amount of cu required to inhibit test isolates at room temperature (24 degrees c) and at 4 degrees c was determined. at room temperature, cu, dzr brass (cu 62%, pb 2.5%, arsenate 0.13% and zn 22.5%) and brass 70/30 (cu 70% and zinc 30%) inhibited c. albicans and k. pneumoniae at 60 min; nickel silver (niag) inhibited c. albicans at 60 min and k. pneumoniae at 270 min. p. aeruginosa was inhibited by brass 70/30 and nickel silver (niag) at 180 min and at 270 min by cu and dzr. cu and dzr inhibited a. baumannii at 180 min while the other alloys were effective at 360 min. stainless steel and pvc showed little or no inhibitory activity. two m. tuberculosis strains, one isoniazid resistant (r267) and the other multidrug resistant (r432), demonstrated growth inhibition with cu of 98% and 88% respectively compared with pvc; the other alloys were less active. time to positivity (ttp) for r267 was >15 days with cu and 11 days for the other alloys; with r432 it was 5 days. effective inhibition of nosocomial pathogens and mtb by cu and alloys was best when the cu content was >55%.
antibacterial and antifungal activities of stereum ostrea, an inedible wild mushroom.
antibacterial and antifungal activities of liquid culture filtrate, water and ethanol extract (solid culture) of stereum ostrea were evaluated against 5 bacteria and 3 plant pathogenic fungi. to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic), we studied 5~300 mg/ml concentrations against bacteria and fungi separately. the mic was 10 mg/ml for bacillus subtilis and 40 mg/ml for colletotrichum gloeosporioides and colletotrichum miyabeanus. liquid culture filtrate was more effective against gram positive than gram negative bacteria, and staphylococcus aureus was the most inhibited (20.3 mm) bacterium. water and ethanol extracts were effective against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria, and water extract was better than ethanol extract. in water and ethanol extract, inhibition zones were 23.6 and 21.0 mm (s. aureus) and 26.3 and 22.3 mm (pseudomonas aeruginosa), respectively. for plant pathogenic fungi, the highest and lowest percent inhibition of mycelial growth (pimg) was found 82.8 and 14.4 against c. miyabeanus and botrytis cinerea in liquid culture filtrate, respectively. in water extract, the pimg was found to be the highest 85.2 and lowest 41.7 for c. miyabeanus and c. gloeosporioides, respectively. the inhibitory effect of ethanol extract was better against c. miyabeanus than c. gloeosporioides and b. cinerea. among 3 samples, water extract was the best against tested pathogenic fungi. this study offers that the extracts isolated from s. ostrea contain potential compounds which inhibit the growth of both bacteria and fungi.
copper(ii) complexes with ligands derived from 4-amino-2,3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolin-5-one: synthesis and biological activity.
the synthesis of cu(ii) complexes derived from schiff base ligands obtained by the condensation of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde or terephtalic aldehyde with 4-amino-antipyrine (4-amino-2,3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolin-5-one) is presented. the newly prepared compounds were characterized by( 1)h-nmr, uv-vis, ir and esr spectroscopy. the determination of the antimicrobial activity of the ligands and of the complexes was carried out on samples of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter boumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and candida sp. the qualitative and quantitative antimicrobial activity test results proved that all the prepared complexes are very active, especially against samples of ps. aeruginosa, a. boumanii, e. coli and s. aureus.
synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of guanylsulfonamides.
a series of guanylsulfonamides, 2-amino-9-[2-substituted-4-(4-substituted piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenyl]-1,9-dihydropurin-6-ones, was synthesized by adopting reductive aminoformylation of 2-amino-5-nitro-6-[4-(piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenylamino]-3h-pyrimidin- 4-one and subsequent intramolecular ring condensation as key steps. all the guanylsulfonamides were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis, and their antifungal activities against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger, and candida albicans. of the guanylsulfonamides, 13e and 13f displayed better antibacterial activities than that of norfloxacin against the bacterial strains s. aureus and s. faecalis except 13f against s. faecalis, which exhibited the activity similar to that of norfloxacin. against the fungal strains a. flavus and a. niger, 13g and 13h showed similar activities to that of griseoflavin-16 except 13h against a. niger, which displayed a profound drop in the activity compared to that of griseoflavin-16. the remarkable inhibition of the growth of the bacterial and fungal strains makes these substances promising microbial agents.
bacterial communications in implant infections: a target for an intelligence war.
the status of population density is communicated among bacteria by specific secreted molecules, called pheromones or autoinducers, and the control mechanism is called ""quorum-sensing"". quorum-sensing systems regulate the expression of a panel of genes, allowing bacteria to adapt to modified environmental conditions at a high density of population. the two known different quorum systems are described as the luxr-luxi system in gram-negative bacteria, which uses an n-acyl-homoserine lactone (ahl) as signal, and the agr system in gram-positive bacteria, which uses a peptide-tiolactone as signal and the rnaiii as effector molecules. both in gram-negative and in gram-positive bacteria, quorum-sensing systems regulate the expression of adhesion mechanisms (biofilm and adhesins) and virulence factors (toxins and exoenzymes) depending on population cell density. in gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa, analogs of signaling molecules such as furanone analogs, are effective in attenuating bacterial virulence and controlling bacterial infections. in grampositive staphylococcus aureus, the quorum-sensing rnaiii-inhibiting peptide (rip), tested in vitro and in animal infection models, has been proved to inhibit virulence and prevent infections. attenuation of bacterial virulence by quorum-sensing inhibitors, rather than by bactericidal or bacteriostatic drugs, is a highly attractive concept because these antibacterial agents are less likely to induce the development of bacterial resistance.
antimicrobial activity of some salvia species essential oils from iran.
the aerial parts of salvia multicaulis, s. sclarea and s. verticillata were collected at full flowering stage. the essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary gc and gc-ms. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oils were studied against eight gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (bacillus subtilis, bacillus pumulis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus niger). the results of antibacterial activity tests of the essential oils according to the disc diffusion method and mic values indicated that all the samples have moderate to high inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria except for p. aeruginosa which was totally resistant. in contrast to antibacterial activity, the oils exhibited no or slight antifungal property, in which only the oil of s. multicaulis showed weak activity against two tested yeasts, c. albicans and s. cerevisiae.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel nucleoside analogues of adenosine and 1,3-dideazaadenosine.
a number of nucleoside analogues have been synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against staphylococcus aureus, group d streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus spp., salmonella spp., aspergillus fumigatus, penicillium marneffei, candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans, and mucor spp. the compounds 1, 4, and 6 emerged as potent antibacterial agents with mic values of 0.75, 0.38, and 0.19 microm, respectively, against group d streptococcus. further, the results suggest that the molecules 4, 6, and 7 would be potent antifungal agents as they show substantial degree of inhibition toward the growth of pathogenic fungi with mics of 0.75, 0.38, and 0.38 microm, respectively.
a 7-year national survey on bacterial resistance in bronchoalveolar lavage from patients hospitalized in argentina.
the purpose of this study is to undertake a nationwide survey on bacterial resistance in bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) from patients hospitalized in argentina. a 2-month point prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (april-may and october-november) from 1997 to 2003 by 36 argentinean centers. antimicrobial susceptibility data of the potential pathogens recovered from the bal (samples containing <1% of squamous epithelial cells and bacterial counts >or=10(4) cfu/ml) of inpatients (i.e., >or=48-h hospital length of stay) with suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) were collected on a computerized system (sir) described previously. the survey was split into 2 periods for comparison purposes, 1997 to 2000 and 2001 to 2003. a total of 752 organisms were included. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent species, followed by acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in both periods, more than a half of the klebsiella pneumoniae strains displayed a phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer. a doubling of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter frequency was shown from the 1st period to the 2nd one (25-48%). more than two-thirds of the s. aureus strains proved to be methicillin resistant in both periods, and a pronounced decrease of resistance rates to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and rifampin was shown in the 2nd period. the present study shows the worrisome increasing bacterial resistance in bal samples to most available antimicrobial options for treating patients with suspected hap. variations over time support the need for systematic tailored surveillance and compel us to establish a rational usage of antimicrobial agents in our country.
diversity of bacterial isolates from commercial and homemade composts.
the diversity of heterotrophic bacterial isolates of three commercial and two homemade composts was studied. the commercial composts were produced from poultry litter (pc), sewage sludge (sc), municipal solid waste (mc), and homemade composts (thermal compost [dc] and vermicompost [vc]) from food wastes. the taxonomic and physiological diversity of the heterotrophic culturable bacteria was assessed using phenotypic and genotypic characterization and the analysis of the partial 16s rrna gene sequence. composts dc and sc presented the higher genotypic diversity, as could be inferred from the number of distinct genotypic patterns observed, 28 and 21, respectively. gram-positive bacteria, mainly firmicutes, were predominant in all the composts. some organisms related with taxa rarely reported in composts, as rhodanobacter spathiphylli, moraxella osloensis, lysobacter, corynebacterium, pigmentiphaga kullae, and new taxa were also isolated. the highest relative proportion of isolates able to degrade starch was found in compost sc (> 70%), to degrade gelatine in compost dc (> 70%), to degrade tween 80 in compost pc (> 90%), and to degrade poly-epsilon-caprolactones in compost dc (> 80%). compost mc presented the lowest relative proportions of isolates able to degrade starch (< 25%), gelatine (< 20%), and poly-epsilon-caprolactone (< 40%). when compared with the others, the homemade composts presented higher relative proportions of gram-positive isolates able to inhibit the target organisms staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. in compost mc, none of the gram-positive isolates was able to inhibit those targets.
[species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the fully automated raisus using an early-harvested cell suspension].
we evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated raisus (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd., tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. a single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. the cell suspension to the raisus was properly prepared to the mcfarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. when the five atcc reference strains, consisting of staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247. the results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those mics obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant mics for certain antimicrobial agents. the significant discrepancy in mic determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18s to 20s of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90s of the tests. with these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by raisus, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of raisus test function.
terpenoids and flavonoids from laggera pterodonta.
to study the chemical constituents of aerial parts of laggera pterodonta (dc.) benth., the air-dried aerial parts of this plant were powered and extracted with boiling water and purified by silica gel column chromatography and recrystallized. eleven compounds were obtained from l. pterodonta. they were identified as to be 6-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-carvotanacetone (1), pterodontic acid (2), 1beta-hydroxy pterondontic acid (3), pterodontoside a (4), pterodondiol (5), pterodontriol b (6), 5-hydroxy-3,4', 6,7-tetramethoxyflavone (7), artemitin (8), chrysosplenetin b (9), quercetin (10) and beta-sitosterol (11). compound 1 is a new monoterpene glucoside. compounds 10 and 11 were isolated from this plant for the first time. compounds 2 and 5 showed moderate activity against bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, mycobacteium phlei and bacillus circulans by paper disc diffusion method, while they both displayed no activity against escherichia coli.
synthesis, reaction and structure of a highly light-stable silver(i) cluster with an ag4s4n4 core having a tridentate 4n-morpholyl 2-acetylpyridine thiosemicarbazone ligand: use of water-soluble silver(i) carboxylates as a silver(i) source.
a novel neutral tetrameric silver(i) cluster [ag(mtsc)](4) was obtained from reactions of a tridentate (4)n-morpholyl 2-acetylpyridine thiosemicarbazone ligand (n'-[1-(2-pyridyl)ethylidene] morpholine-4-carbothiohydrazide, hmtsc) and silver(i) sources containing ag-o bonds (ag(2)o, ag(oac), silver(i) 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate (infinity){[ag(hpyrrld)](2)}, silver(i) 5-oxo-2-tetrahydrofurancarboxylate (infinity){[ag(othf)](2)}, and silver(i) complexes with camphanic acid (infinity){[ag(ca)]} and (infinity){[ag(ca)(hca)]}). the cluster was characterized by elemental analysis, tg/dta, ftir and single-crystal x-ray analysis in the solid state. the solution properties of the complexes were investigated using solution molecular weight measurement, esi-ms and solution ((1)h, (13)c and (31)p) nmr spectroscopy. the obtained cluster is a novel example of a light-stable ag(i) cluster with a tridentate thiosemicarbazone ligand and the second report of a crystal structure of a thiosemicarbazone silver(i) complex. the reaction of the tetramer with a large excess of pph(3) gave dimeric complexes, namely, [ag(micro(s)-mtsc)(pph(3))](2) and [(pph(3))(2)ag(micro(s)-mtsc)(2)ag]. the chloroform solution of the tetrameric complex showed modest and effective activities against selected bacteria (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae), respectively, but it did not inhibit the growth of any selected microorganisms in a water-suspension system.
prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms isolated from sputa of patients with cystic fibrosis.
background: new emerging pathogens and associated antimicrobial resistance mechanisms have been observed in the respiratory tract of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (cf) in the last years. amongst others, the rate of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains is growing. however, there are no published data on the prevalence of mbl-producing p. aeruginosa in cf patients to our knowledge. methods: in this study, 271 sputum samples of 60 cf patients were collected during a 12-months period. microbiological cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the most frequently isolated bacteria were performed. results: 464 bacterial and 414 fungal strains were isolated and characterized. 63.3% of the patients harbored staphylococcus aureus, 50% p. aeruginosa, 16.6% haemophilus influenzae, 15% stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 13.3% non tuberculous mycobacteria (ntm). methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and mbl-producing p. aeruginosa were detected in 3 (5%) and 5 (8.3%) patients respectively. among the fungi, aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans showed the highest prevalence. conclusions: the detection of mbl-producing p. aeruginosa and mrsa in cf patients confirms that antimicrobial resistance patterns should be always kept under surveillance. moreover hygiene regulations in cf clinics should prevent a further spread of resistant bacterial strains.
therapeutic potential of cationic steroid antibacterials.
antibiotics were one of the great health successes of the 20th century. antibiotics, both naturally derived and synthetic, have resulted in huge decreases in both morbidity and mortality from bacterial infections. as a consequence, the 'antibiotic age' has changed public expectations about the results of infectious disease. however, this has led to high levels of inappropriate prescribing, where antibiotics may be administered to fulfil patient expectations rather than for clinical benefit. along with unwise uses in agriculture and elsewhere, this has contributed to recent rises in numbers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. as a result, many commentators have described this as the end of the antibiotic age and the term 'superbug' has entered the common vocabulary for multi-drug-resistant bacteria such as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, multi-drug-resistant staphylococcus aureus and multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this context, an attractive approach for the development of antibacterial agents is the use of a new class of cationic steroidal compounds mimicking polymyxin activities. the permeabilization properties of these agents of the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria are reported in this review, as well as a discussion of literature results.
[the role of cell wall organization and active efflux pump systems in multidrug resistance of bacteria].
multiple antibiotic resistance of clinically important bacteria are of major concern worldwide. alterations of drug targets or enzymatic inactivation of antimicrobial agents are the well known mechanisms of antimicrobial drug resistance. besides these well known mechanisms, recent studies have shown that a further resistance mechanism, active drug efflux, has become increasingly important in the current threat of multidrug resistance. it involves certain bacterial transport proteins which pump out toxic antimicrobial compounds from the cell. drug efflux pump proteins in bacteria fall into five distinct protein super families [atp binding cassette super family (abc), major facilitator super family (mfs), small multidrug resistance super family (smr), multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (mate) super family, resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd) super family] and are mostly encoded by chromosomal genes. among them, the members of rnd protein super family are widely distrubuted in gram negative bacteria and play siginificant role in both, intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance of these bacteria with very wide substrate specificity. rnd type multidrug efflux proteins usually function together with an outer membrane canal protein (omp) and a membrane fusion protein (mfp) to pump out drugs. acrab-tolc of escherichia coli and mexab-oprm of pseudomonas aeruginosa are the typical examples of these tripartite systems. they are constitutively expressed in wild type cells and play significant role in intrinsic resistance of these bacteria. however, multidrug resistance which is of major clinical significance, rises as a result of overexpression of these pump systems due to mutations and elevated levels of resistance are recorded to structurally unrelated antimicrobial drugs such as fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, aminoglycosides and toxic compunds. synthesis of rnd type pump proteins are regulated by complex genetic mechanisms and global activator proteins (mara, soxs, rob) are significant in the induction of overexpression of these efflux pump systems. outer membrane of gram negative bacteria with its unique lipopolysaccharide rich structure also contributes to drug efflux and other antimicrobial resistance mechanisms by reducing the influx rate of toxic antimicrobial compunds. multidrug efflux pump proteins found in gram positive bacteria and mycobacteria are usually the members of protein super families other than rnd family and their substrate profiles are more limited. however, some of these efflux proteins (nora, msra, qaca in staphylococcus aureus; pmra and emea in streptococcus pneumoniae) have clinical significance in the resistance to several antimicrobial agents (fluoroquinolones, macrolids) and toxic substances (quarternery ammonium compounds). in this review article, the role of cell wall organization and active efflux pump systems in multidrug resistance of bacteria have been discussed.
broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.
synthesis and structure of silver complexes with nicotinate-type ligands having antibacterial activities against clinically isolated antibiotic resistant pathogens.
the synthesis and low-temperature x-ray crystal structures of five new silver complexes, [ag(2)-mu-o,o'(2-aminonicotinium)(2)(no(3))(2)](n) (7), [ag(isonicotinamide)(2)-mu-o,o'(no(3))](2) (8), [ag(ethyl nicotinate)(2)](no(3)) (9), [ag(ethyl isonicotinate)(2)(no(3))] (10), and [ag(methyl isonicotinate)(2)(h(2)o)](no(3)) (11), are presented and fully characterized by spectral and elemental analysis. the antimicrobial activities of these complexes were screened using 12 different clinical isolates belonging to four pathogenic bacteria, s. aureus, s. pyogenes, p. mirabilis, and ps. aeruginosa, all obtained from diabetic foot ulcers. these tested bacteria were resistant for at least 10 antibiotics commonly used for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. compounds 7 and 8 had considerable activity against ps. aeruginosa (mic values 2-8 microg/ml), compound 9 against s. aureus (mic 4-16 microg/ml) and s. pyogenes (mic 2-4 microg/ml), and also 9 and 11 against p. mirabilis (mic 1-16 microg/ml). all complexes were non-toxic for daphnia at concentrations above 512 microg/ml overnight.
antimicrobial properties of highly fluorinated tris(pyrazolyl)borates.
highly fluorinated tris(pyrazolyl)borates were tested for their antimicrobial activity against various bacterial species. both the silver(i) tris(pyrazolyl)borate [hb(3,5-(cf(3))(2)pz)(3)]ag(thf) (thf=tetrahydrofuran) and the sodium analog [hb(3,5-(cf(3))(2)pz)(3)]na(thf) appeared highly effective at inhibiting the growth of two different species of gram-positive bacteria (i.e. being 12 and 21 fold more effective, respectively, (on a molar basis, based on the minimum inhibitory concentrations) against staphylococcus aureus than silver sulfadiazine, a currently used silver antimicrobial). this suggests that the ligand portion of these molecules is responsible for the observed high effectiveness against the gram-positive species. furthermore, it appeared that the fluorinated substituents on the tris(pyrazolyl)borate were important for this high level of growth inhibition. against two species of gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, the fluorinated silver(i) tris(pyrazolyl)borate exhibited a moderate level of growth inhibition (similar to that of silver sulfadiazine), while the sodium analog showed very little ability to inhibit growth, indicating that for the gram-negative species, the apparent responsible antimicrobial portion is the silver ion.
in vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of h2 receptor antagonists.
enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme dna gyrase. there are a number of drug interactions reported for enoxacin. on the other hand h2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. as the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. in present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a b.p. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and h2-receptor antagonists alone. the interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. these studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (ph 9) and buffers of ph 7.4 simulating blood ph at 37 degrees c. in order to support these interaction studies, the effect of h2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (mic) of enoxacin was also studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis. on the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with h2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in mic of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.
antimicrobial activity of seven hypericum entities from central italy.
methanol-acetone extracts from aerial parts of seven entities of the genus hypericum [h. perforatum l. subsp. perforatum, h. perforatum l. subsp. veronense (schrank) ces., h. montanum l., h. hyssopifolium chaix, h. hirsutum l., h. hircinum l. subsp. majus (aiton) n. robson, h. tetrapterum fr.] growing in the appennino umbro-marchigiano (central italy) were tested in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against two gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), two gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and the yeast candida albicans, by the kirby-bauer agar diffusion method. the two h. perforatum subspecies were particularly active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, supporting the use of these plants in the traditional medicine of central italy to treat wounds, skin and infectious diseases. however significant values of inhibition were given also by h. hirsutum against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, and by h. hyssopifolium, h. hircinum subsp. majus and h. tetrapterum against c. albicans. these results suggest that hypericin and hyperforin are the main components responsible for antimicrobial activity, but not the only ones, as other extracts, showing a low level of these compounds, possess evident activity. isolation of pure compounds from the most active extracts is in progress.
self-sterilizing catheters with titanium dioxide photocatalyst thin films for clean intermittent catheterization: basis and study of clinical use.
objective: clean intermittent catheterization (cic) requires a large number of disposable catheters or a large amount of water and disinfectant. we made titanium dioxide (tio(2))-coated catheters for cic using technology we have developed previously, and examined the photocatalytic antibacterial effect of this catheter using only light energy and the safety of this type of catheter for practical clinical use. methods: tio(2)-coated catheters were filled with bacterial cell suspensions and illuminated with a 15-w black-light lamp for testing antibacterial potency. next, we soaked control toxic materials (zinc diethyldithiocarbamate) and the tips of tio(2)-coated catheters in m05 medium, and evaluated cell toxicity from the numbers of v79 colonies in these dilutions. then, bodyweight curves and histological tissue changes were observed over a period of time in mouse-transplanted tio(2)-coated catheters and control catheters. finally, we investigated the use of these tio(2)-coated catheters in 18 patients by questionnaire and bacterial culture of tio(2)-coated catheters and control catheters. results: the survival rate of escherichia coli in the liquid inside the tio(2) catheter decreased to a negligible level within 60 min under ultraviolet (uv)-a illumination. the survival rate of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens also decreased to a negligible level within 60 min. v79 cells showed no cytotoxicity of this catheter, and there was no difference in bodyweight or foreign body reaction between mouse-transplanted tio(2)-coated catheters and control catheters. in a preliminary clinical analysis of 18 patients who voluntarily used this catheter, the rate of positive bacterial culture of the tips of tio(2)-coated catheters was 20% versus 60% for conventional catheters after 4 weeks of use. conclusion: tio(2)-coated silicone catheters were easily sterilized under certain light sources and were shown to be safe in an experiment using cultured cells and in animal experiments. sterilizing catheters with tio(2) photocatalyst thin films are expected to be used clinically for clean intermittent catheterization after proper modification based on this study.
synthesis and antibacterial activity of 5-deoxy-5-episubstituted arbekacin derivatives.
5-deoxy-5-episubstituted arbekacin derivatives have been designed and efficiently synthesized. the synthetic compounds showed potent antibacterial activity against both staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in particular, these derivatives were superior to arbekacin against mrsa strains expressing the bifunctional aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme aac(6')-aph(2''). the antibacterial activity of the 5-deoxy-5-episubstituted arbekacin derivatives against pseudomonas aeruginosa was markedly influenced by the efflux system of mexxy/oprm. the 6'-n-methyl derivative of the 5-epi arbekacin was effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa expressing the aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme aac(6').
metal-based antibacterial and antifungal agents: synthesis, characterization, and in vitro biological evaluation of co(ii), cu(ii), ni(ii), and zn(ii) complexes with amino acid-derived compounds.
a series of antibacterial and antifungal amino acid-derived compounds and their cobalt(ii), copper(ii), nickel(ii), and zinc(ii) metal complexes have been synthesized and characterized by their elemental analyses, molar conductances, magnetic moments, and ir, and electronic spectral measurements. ligands (l(1))-(l(5)) were derived by condensation of beta-diketones with glycine, phenylalanine, valine, and histidine and act as bidentate towards metal ions (cobalt, copper, nickel, and zinc) via the azomethine-n and deprotonated-o of the respective amino acid. the stoichiometric reaction between the metal(ii) ion and synthesized ligands in molar ratio of m : l (1 : 1) resulted in the formation of the metal complexes of type [m(l)(h(2)o)(4)]cl (where m = co(ii), cu(ii), and zn(ii)) and of m : l (1 : 2) of type [m(l)(2)(h(2)o)(2)] (where m = co(ii), cu(ii), ni(ii), and zn(ii)). the magnetic moment data suggested for the complexes to have an octahedral geometry around the central metal atom. the electronic spectral data also supported the same octahedral geometry of the complexes. elemental analyses and nmr spectral data of the ligands and their metal(ii) complexes agree with their proposed structures. the synthesized ligands, along with their metal(ii) complexes, were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against four gram-negative (escherichia coli, shigella flexeneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi) and two gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus) bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, and candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal(ii) complexes to be more antibacterial/antifungal against one or more species as compared to the uncomplexed ligands. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties. five compounds, (3), (7), (10), (11), and (22), displayed potent cytotoxic activity as ld(50) = 8.974 x 10(-4), 7.022 x 10(-4), 8.839 x 10(-4), 7.133 x 10(-4), and 9.725 x 10(-4) m/ml, respectively, against artemia salina.
comparative review of the carbapenems.
the carbapenems are beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with an exceptionally broad  spectrum of activity. older carbapenems, such as imipenem, were often susceptible to degradation by the enzyme dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) located in renal tubules and required co-administration with a dhp-1 inhibitor such as cilastatin. later additions to the class such as meropenem, ertapenem and doripenem demonstrated increased stability to dhp-1 and are administered without a dhp-1 inhibitor. like all beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, carbapenems act by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). carbapenems are stable to most beta-lactamases including ampc beta-lactamases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. resistance to carbapenems develops when bacteria acquire or develop structural changes within their pbps, when they acquire metallo-beta-lactamases that are capable of rapidly degrading carbapenems, or when changes in membrane permeability arise as a result of loss of specific outer membrane porins. carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem) possess broad-spectrum in vitro activity, which includes activity against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria; carbapenems lack activity against enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. compared with imipenem, meropenem and doripenem, the spectrum of activity of ertapenem is more limited primarily because it lacks activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus spp. imipenem, meropenem and doripenem have in vivo half lives of approximately 1 hour, while ertapenem has a half-life of approximately 4 hours making it suitable for once-daily administration. as with other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the most important pharmacodynamic parameter predicting in vivo efficacy is the time that the plasma drug concentration is maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic). imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem have been studied in comparative clinical trials establishing their efficacy in the treatment of a variety of infections including complicated intra-abdominal infections, skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections, meningitis (meropenem only) and febrile neutropenia. the current role for imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem in therapy remains for use in moderate to severe nosocomial and polymicrobial infections. the unique antimicrobial spectrum and pharmacokinetic properties of ertapenem make it more suited to treatment of community-acquired infections and outpatient intravenous antimicrobial therapy than for the treatment of nosocomial infections. doripenem is a promising new carbapenem with similar properties to those of meropenem, although it appears to have more potent in vitro activity against p. aeruginosa than meropenem. clinical trials are required to establish the efficacy and safety of doripenem in moderate to severe infections, including nosocomial infections.
phytochemical and biological studies on saudi commiphora opobalsamum l.
the aerial part of commiphora opobalsamum l. (burseraceae) growing in saudi arabia was subjected to a phytopharmacological investigation in order to identify its major chemical constituents and to evaluate its extracts and isolated compounds in preliminary in vitro assays for antimicrobial, antimalarial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory (cox-2 inhibition), antioxidant and estrogenic activity. six compounds were isolated and identified as the triterpenes friedelin, canophyllal, and oleanonic acid; the flavonols mearnsetin and quercetin; and syringic acid. the ethyl acetate extract was moderately active against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and plasmodium falciparum; while the petroleum ether and chloroform extracts inhibited cox-2 at 5 and 10 microg ml(-1), respectively. of the isolated compounds, syringic acid showed moderate antimalarial, anticandidal, and antimycobacterial activity; while mearnsetin and quercetin exhibited antioxidant activity comparable to ascorbic acid and trolox. this is the first detailed phytochemical investigation of c. opobalsamum l. growing in saudi arabia and elsewhere. the isolated compounds are reported from this plant for the first time and their full (1)h and (13)c nmr assignments are included.
comparison of in vitro activities of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam against aerobic bacterial pathogens from patients with nosocomial infections.
background and purpose: there is a rapid worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, especially in nosocomial isolates. this study compared the in vitro activities of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 208 aerobic bacterial pathogens that caused 197 nosocomial infections in 184 patients. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by e test in accordance with the guidelines of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. results: most (140/208, 67%) of the isolates were facultative gram-negative bacilli. levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were the most effective (22/22, 100%) against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus. none of the antibiotics tested were found to be effective (0/25) against oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 11 isolates of acinetobacter baumannii that were not pandrug-resistant (pdr), only 9 isolates (9/11, 81%) were sensitive to imipenem and 5 isolates (5/11, 45%) were sensitive to levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime. another 22 isolates of a. baumannii that were pdr were completely resistant to all 6 antibiotics. the majority of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to these 6 antimicrobial agents with 10/11 (91%) sensitive to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, 9/11 (83%) sensitive to ceftazidime, cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, and 8/11 (75%) sensitive to imipenem. conclusions: the majority of the bacterial isolates causing nosocomial infections were found to be sensitive to the 6 antibiotics tested. bacterial isolates of nosocomial infections that were completely resistant to these 6 antibiotics were pdr a. baumannii, pdr p. aeruginosa, and oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. more potent antimicrobial agents are needed to treat infections caused by pdr a. baumannii and pdr p. aeruginosa.
synthesis of new s-derivatives of clubbed triazolyl thiazole as anti-mycobacterium tuberculosis agents.
in the present study, a series of n-{4-[(4-amino-5-sulfanyl-4h-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)methyl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl}-2-subst ituted-amide (1a-d) derivatives were synthesized in good yields and characterized by ir, 1h nmr, mass spectral and elemental analyses. the compounds were evaluated for their preliminary in vitro antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhosa and then were screened for antitubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37 rv strain by broth microdilution assay method. the antibacterial data of the tested compounds indicated that most of the synthesized compounds showed better activity against bacteria compared to reference drugs. the in vitro antitubercular activity reports of tested compounds against m. tuberculosis strain h37 rv showed moderate to better activity.
is bronchoalveolar lavage with quantitative cultures a useful tool for diagnosing ventilator-associated pneumonia?
the results of a recently published canadian study suggest that bronchoalveolar lavage and endotracheal aspiration are associated with similar clinical outcomes and similar overall use of antibiotics in critically ill patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). the study, however, does not provide convincing information on the best strategy to diagnose vap, to accurately choose initial treatment and to exclude vap in order to avoid administering antibiotics to patients without bacterial infection. in fact, this trial has several limitations or drawbacks: patients at risk for developing vap due to pseudomonas aeruginosa or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were excluded, far from the real-life scenario; a significant number of patients were receiving recent antimicrobial therapy at the time of sampling, with, consequently, difficult-to-interpret culture results; randomization of included patients for initial treatment - meropenem plus ciprofloxacin or meropenem alone - resulted in a high rate of inappropriate initial empirical therapy due to the absence of customization to local epidemiology; and the initial decision to treat and the re-evaluation at day 3 were, in fact, based on clinical judgment and not on direct examination and quantitative culture results. in summary, because antimicrobial treatment was initiated in all suspected patients and was rarely withheld in patients with negative cultures, the study does not suggest an appropriate strategy for improving the use of antibiotics in intensive care unit patients. such a strategy has two requirements: immediate administration of adequate therapy in patients with true vap, and avoidance of administering antibiotics in patients without bacterial infection.
polyamine effects on antibiotic susceptibility in bacteria.
biogenic polyamines (e.g., spermidine and spermine) are a group of essential polycationic compounds found in all living cells. the effects of spermine and spermidine on antibiotic susceptibility were examined with gram-negative escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium bacteria and clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and with gram-positive staphylococcus aureus bacteria, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). exogenous spermine exerted a dose-dependent inhibition effect on the growth of e. coli, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and s. aureus but not p. aeruginosa, as depicted by mic and growth curve measurements. while the mics of polymyxin and ciprofloxacin were in general increased by exogenous spermine and spermidine in p. aeruginosa, this adverse effect was not observed in enteric bacteria and s. aureus. it was found that spermine and spermidine can decrease the mics of beta-lactam antibiotics in all strains as well as other types of antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner. significantly, the mics of oxacillin for mrsa mu50 and n315 were decreased more than 200-fold in the presence of spermine, and this effect of spermine was retained when assessed in the presence of divalent ions (magnesium or calcium; 3 mm) or sodium chloride (150 mm). the effect of spermine on the sensitization of p. aeruginosa and mrsa to antibiotics was further demonstrated by population analysis and time-killing assays. the results of checkerboard assays with e. coli and s. aureus indicated a strong synergistic effect of spermine in combination with beta-lactams and chloramphenicol. the decreased mics of beta-lactams implied that the possible blockage of outer membrane porins by exogenous spermine or spermidine did not play a crucial role in most cases. in contrast, only the mic of imipenem against p. aeruginosa was increased by exogenous spermine and spermidine, and this resistance effect was abolished in a mutant strain devoid of the outer membrane porin oprd. in e. coli, the mics of carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline were decreased in two acra mutants devoid of a major efflux pump, acrab. however, retention of the spermine effect on antibiotic susceptibility in two acra mutants of e. coli suggested that the acrab efflux pump was not the target for a synergistic effect by spermine and antibiotics and ruled out the hypothesis of spermine serving as an efflux pump inhibitor in this organism. in summary, this interesting finding of the effect of spermine on antibiotic susceptibility provides the basis for a new potential approach against drug-resistant pathogens by use of existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
a new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
the use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. a marine bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from eal fish of baluchistan coast of pakistan. this strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. in this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of p. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa), salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, vibrio aliginolyticus, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter faecium but it is not active against g streptococci, candida albicans, aspergillus niger. minimal inhibitory concentration for gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg ml(-1) and for gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg ml(-1).
antibacterial activity of carbapenems against clinically isolated respiratory bacterial pathogens in japan between 2005 and 2006.
the current status of the susceptibility of the main respiratory bacterial pathogens was evaluated by analysing the antibacterial activity of 21 drugs, including four carbapenems, against five species of the pathogens isolated between january 2005 and january 2006. a total of 157 strains were studied. carbapenems inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains at concentrations that were below the breakpoints set by the japanese society of chemotherapy (2 and 1mug/ml for pneumonia and chronic respiratory tract infection, respectively). however, the majority of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were resistant to carbapenems. meropenem, but not the other carbapenems, inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae isolates, including beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin-resistant strains, at concentrations of <or=1 microg/ml. the mic(50) and mic(90) of meropenem, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, against pseudomonas aeruginosa were the lowest of the carbapenems. by comparing these results with our previous data, it was found that there was no increase in resistance to carbapenems in any of the species tested. thus, it can be stated that carbapenems have retained their position as key drugs for severe respiratory tract infections.
potency and spectrum of garenoxacin tested against an international collection of skin and soft tissue infection pathogens: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1999-2004).
the spectrum and potency of garenoxacin, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone, against a large international collection (11723 strains) of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens that cause skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) were evaluated for the years 1999 to 2004. consecutive nonduplicate bacterial isolates were collected from patients with documented community-acquired or nosocomial ssti in >70 medical centers participating in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program in north america (37.4%), europe (26.7%), latin america (16.7%), and the asia-pacific region (19.2%). all isolates were tested using the reference broth microdilution methods against garenoxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and representative comparator agents used for the empiric or directed therapy for ssti. ranking pathogens producing ssti during these years included staphylococcus aureus (42.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.1%), escherichia coli (9.0%), enterococcus spp. (7.3%), klebsiella spp. (4.8%), enterobacter spp. (4.7%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.5%), and acinetobacter spp. (2.1%). garenoxacin was the most potent agent tested against s. aureus and was at least 2-fold more active than gatifloxacin (mic(50), 0.06 mg/l) and 8-fold more active than levofloxacin (mic(50), 0.25 mg/l). furthermore, garenoxacin was 2- to 8-fold more potent than the fluoroquinolones against beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, as well as up to 4-fold more active against enterococci. garenoxacin was largely comparable with the comparator fluoroquinolones against e. coli, klebsiella spp., and acinetobacter spp., but it is less active than these agents against p. aeruginosa. in summary, garenoxacin was documented to be the most potent quinolone when tested against key gram-positive pathogens (s. aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci) and was similar in activity to these agents against other species (enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp.). these in vitro data suggest that garenoxacin warrants further clinical studies in ssti, especially against staphylococci and streptococcal pathogens.
amikacin-loaded vascular prosthesis as an effective drug carrier.
strong covalent immobilization of amikacin on uni-graft((r)) dv straight vascular prostheses made of gelatine-sealed poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibres was performed according to procedure described in the polish patent no. p-358934. the concentrations of amikacin in sample solutions were estimated either by hplc or by uv spectroscopy method previously optimized for amikacin measurements. a high correlation was found between these two methods. it was found that the antibiotic was bound in mixed-type way via three types of interactions: strong covalent bonds (dominating amount: 81.84%) and weak interactions: physical adsorption and ionic bonds (18.19%). even when total amount of physically and ionically attached drug has been released, the remaining covalently bound amount still locally protected the prostheses in vitro against bacteria. the release test was conducted in pbs at ph 7.4 at 37 degrees c and showed that about 15% of total drug amount was eluted from the matrix during the first 7 days of shaking, then no more antibiotic was released. it suggested that about 85% of amikacin attached to prosthesis modified in mixed-type mode was bound via covalent interactions. a bacterial inhibition test on escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 showed inhibition of growth for all strains at low inoculum concentrations up to 30 days as well as high inoculum concentration for e. coli. at high concentrations of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, the modified prostheses showed slight bacteriostatic effect since 10th day of experiment. amikacin-modified vascular prostheses might therefore be protected against bacterial infection locally, without long-lasting drug release to human system.
an in vitro assessment of the antibacterial effect of garlic (allium sativum) on  bacterial isolates from wound infections.
background: garlic (allium sativum) has come to be seen as an all rounded treatment for preventing wound infection, common cold, malaria, cough and lung tuberculosis, hypertension, sexually transmitted diseases, mental illness, kidney diseases, liver diseases, asthma, diabetes. objective: the main objective of this study was to assess the antibacterial effect of crude preparation of garlic on bacterial isolates from the wound infections. methods: an experimental study was conducted in gondar university teaching hospital school of medical laboratory technology, microbiology laboratory from june 2004 to april 2005 by agar dilution technique. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of garlic to control strains of staphylococcus aureus attc 25923 and escherichia coli attcc 25922, as well as to clinical isolates of s. aureus, e. coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using agar dilution method the data was collected in triplicate. results: all the tested organisms were inhibited by 33.75 mg/ml of the crude preparation of garlic except control organism and clinical isolates of s. aureus, which were inhibited by 11.25 mg/ml of crude garlic. garlic did not reveal bactericidal effect up to a concentration of 37.5 mg/ml against all the tested organisms. conclusion: crude preparation of garlic could be used as an effective antibacterial agent for the tested organisms. nevertheless, clinical trial on the effect of garlic is essential before advocating large-scale therapy.
composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of actinidia macrosperma from china.
actinidia macrosperma is a medicinal plant in china and has been well known for its attraction to cats and activities against leprosy and cancers. the compositions and the antimicrobial activity of its leaf oil were reported for the first time. the oil obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gc and gc-ms, was characterized by the high content of monoterpenes. linalool (48.14%) is the major component identified, followed by 1,2-dimethyl-lindoline (7.94%), linolenic acid methylester (6.57%) and (e)-phytol (5.29%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil was evaluated against four bacterial and three fungal species. the results showed that it exhibited a mild antibacterial activity against two gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis), a significant activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli), and no activity on pseudomonas aeruginosa. the test fungi were more sensitive to the oil, with a mic range of 0.78-1.56 microl ml(-1) than bacteria in the range which were significantly higher from 0.78 to 25.50 microl ml(-1).
antimicrobial activities of some tetrahydronaphthalene-benzimidazole derivatives.
novel retinoid derivatives containing a benzimidazole moiety were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial activity. their antimicrobial activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, candida krusei and candida albicans were evaluated. while some of the compounds exhibited moderate activity against mrsa, s. aureus, e. faecalis, c. krusei and c. albicans, none of the compounds showed activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa.
antibacterial activity of snake, scorpion and bee venoms: a comparison with purified venom phospholipase a2 enzymes.
aims: venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. methods and results: thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified pla(2)s and two l-amino acid oxidases (laao) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). several snake venoms (daboia russelli russelli, crotalus adamanteus, naja sumatrana, pseudechis guttata, agkistrodon halys, acanthophis praelongus and daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. daboia russelli russelli and pseudechis australis venoms exhibited the most potent activity against staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. the order of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -s. aureus > proteus mirabilis > proteus vulgaris > enterobacter aerogenes > pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against s. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). a stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). the mic were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). conclusion: the present findings indicate that viperidae (d. russelli russelli) and elapidae (p. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the pla(2) enzymes. the results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. significance and impact of the study: the activity of laao and pla(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.
synthesis, stereochemistry and antimicrobial evaluation of some n-morpholinoacetyl-2,6-diarylpiperidin-4-ones.
in a search for new leads towards potent antimicrobial agents, an array of novel  n-morpholinoacetyl-2,6-diarylpiperidin-4-ones has been synthesized and their in vitro antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi and antifungal activity against candida albicans, rhizopus sp., aspergillus niger and aspergillus flavus were evaluated. structure and stereochemistry of all the n-morpholinoacetyl-2,6-diarylpiperidin-4-ones have been analyzed using (1)h and (13)c nmr spectroscopic techniques. in all the cases, amide n-co group is preferentially in coplanar orientation with respect to the dynamically averaged plane of the piperidone ring. further, all the symmetrically substituted compounds 19, 23, 24, 26 and 27 are expected to adopt half boat conformations while other compounds 20-22 and 25 adopt twist-boat conformations. structure-activity relationship results for these nine compounds have shown that compounds 26 and 27 exerted excellent antibacterial activity against all the bacterial strains used except 27 against s. aureus. against c. albicans and a. flavus, compound 24 recorded excellent antifungal activities while against rhizopus sp., compound 25 showed potent activities. the obtained results may be used as key step for the building of novel chemical compounds with interesting antimicrobial profiles comparable to that of the standard drugs.
antibacterial activity of elaeagnus umbellata (thunb.) a medicinal plant from pakistan.
objective: to evaluate the biological activity of elaeagnus umbellata extracts on standard microorganism strains as well as multi-drug resistant bacteria isolated from hospitals. methods: we carried out this study at the plant pathology laboratory of the university college of agriculture, rawalakot pakistan during the period between september-november 2004. flowers, leaves, and berries of the plant were extracted in different solvents and tested for their antibacterial activity by disc diffusion method on selected organisms like methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), multi-drug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (e. coli). results: the ether extract of flower was found to be highly effective against e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis). the alcohol extract of these leaves also demonstrated strong activity against gram positive and negative bacteria. the aqueous extract from the berry strongly inhibited the growth of e. coli and s. aureus whereas, it exhibited a very small zone of inhibition against b. subtilis. multi-drug resistant p. aeruginosa was found completely resistant to aqueous extract. the acetone extract of the berry showed good activity against p. aeruginosa. conclusion: the present study reports the antibacterial activity of elaeagnus umbellata. most of the extracts displayed broad-spectrum activity, since gram positive bacteria including s. aureus, b. subtilis and gram-negative bacteria including e. coli and p. aeruginosa were inhibited. these preliminary findings may provide the basis for traditional use of this plant in the treatment of infectious diseases.
in-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of metal-based furanyl derived sulfonamides.
a new series of antibacterial and antifungal furanyl-derived sulfonamides and their cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) metal complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against four gram-negative (escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi) and two gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus) bacterial strains and, for in-vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glaberata. the results of these studies revealed that all compounds showed significant to moderate antibacterial activity. however, the zinc (ii) complexes were found to be comparatively much more active as compared to the others. for antifungal activity generally, compounds (22) and (24) showed significant activity against escherichia coli (a), (6) against shigella flexeneri (b), (16) and (22) against pseudomonas aeruginosa (c), (14) and (16) against salmonella typhi (d), (9) against staphylococcus aureus (e) and, (14) and (16) against bacillus subtilis (f) fungal strains. the brine shrimp (artemia salina) bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties. only three compounds, (6), (10) and (23) displayed potent cytotoxic activity with ld50 = 1.8535 x 10(-4), 1.8173 x 10(-4) and 1.9291 x 10(-4) respectively.

some antibacterial and antifungal furanylmethyl-and thienylmethyl dithiolenes and, their co(ii), cu(ii), ni (ii) and zn (ii) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against four gram-negative; escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and shigella flexeneri, and two gram-positive; bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus bacterial strains, and for in-vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glaberata. all compounds showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity. the metal complexes, however, were shown to possess better activity as compared to the simple ligands. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties.
antibacterial activity, structure and cmc relationships of alkanediyl alpha,omega-bis(dimethylammonium bromide) surfactants.
some alpha,omega-alkanediyl bis-dimethylammonium bromide compounds (gemini surfactants) referred as "m-s-m" have been synthesized, purified and characterized by usual spectroscopic methods. these compounds have been screened for antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. their activity was compared. the compounds tested showed excellent in vitro antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus ranging from 1.5 to 20 microg/ml and had variable activity against e. coli with minimum minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 50 microg/ml. these compounds are less active against p. aeruginosa. on the other hand, contrary to the antibacterial activity of these products against s. aureus, a relation between the mic and the critical micellar concentration (cmc) was found and relationship between chain's length and antibacterial activity was found.
effects of combined 405-nm and 880-nm light on staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro.
objective: the aim of this study was to determine the effect of a combination of  405-nm blue light and 880-nm infrared light on staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro. background data: reports indicate that certain wavelengths and treatment parameters of light promote the growth of bacteria, but our earlier study indicates that light at specific wavelengths and intensities are bactericidal for specific organisms (1). methods: two common aerobes, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested because of their frequent isolation from skin infections and wounds. each organism was treated simultaneously with a combination of 405-nm and 880-nm light emitted by a cluster of super luminous diodes (slds). doses of 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 jcm2 were used. colony counts were performed and compared to untreated controls using student t tests and one-way anova with tukey and scheffe post hoc analyses. results: the results revealed significant dose-dependent bactericidal effects of the combined blue and infrared light on staphylococcus aureus (f 4,94 = 5.38, p = 0.001) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (f 4,95 = 21.35, p < 0.001). with p. aeruginosa, the treatment reduced the number of bacteria colonies at all doses, achieving statistical significance at 1, 3, and 20 j cm2 doses and reducing bacterial colony by as much as 93.8%; the most effective dose being 20 j cm2. irradiation of s. aureus resulted in statistically significant decreases in bacterial colonies at all dose levels; the most decrease, 72%, was also achieved with 20 jcm2. conclusion: appropriate doses of combined 405-nm and 880-nm phototherapy can kill staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, suggesting that a similar effect may be produced in clinical cases of bacterial infection.
management of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multiresistant bacteria.
purpose of review: the inappropriate choice of antibiotics (in nearly one third of episodes) is the most important risk factor for death. traditionally, a narrow-spectrum drug was used first, and the most potent drugs were reserved for subsequent use. recent findings: as multidrug resistance increases in the intensive care unit in patients treated for nosocomial pneumonia, costs, mortality, and morbidity are rising. although methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii are frequently considered together, they have different virulence, risk factors and susceptibilities, requiring different antimicrobial choices. assessment of clinical resolution should be differentiated in the presence of acute lung injury. in the absence of biochemical markers, oxygenation and core temperature should guide therapeutic decisions. summary: as ventilator-associated pneumonia increases, empiric therapy should be based on local pathogen etiology and antibiotic resistant patterns. a new approach to consider is to start with a high-dose, broad-spectrum antibiotic and then tailor the individual therapy based on microbiological results and clinical resolution. with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics available in empiric therapy tailored after reassessment of the patient, there is hope for reducing costs, length of stay and mortality whereas the emergence of resistance will be minimized.
antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activities of anthocephalus cadamba.
anthocephalus cadamba (roxb.) miq. syn a. chinensis (lamk) a. rich (rubiaceae) is ethnomedicinally widely used in the form of paste by tribe in western ghats for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobial potential of a. cadamba against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing. the alchoholic and aqueous extract of this plant showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four fungi candida albicans, trichophyton rubrum--dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus and aspergillus nidulans--systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus) with an mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that a. cadamba extract has potent wound healing capacity as shown from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that a. cadamba extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.
phytochemical and in vitro antimicrobial assay of the leaf extract of newbouldia  laevis.
the methanolic leaf extract of newbouldia laevis was subjected to preliminary phytochemical screening and in-vitro antimicrobial tests. the extract revealed the presence of flavonoids, tannins, terpenes, steroidal and cardiac glycosides. the antimicrobial activity of the plant extract was assayed by the agar plate disc diffusion and nutrient broth dilution techniques. test microorganisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, klebsiella spp. and candida albicans; all the organisms were laboratory isolates. the extract inhibited the growth of all the test organisms especially against klebsiella spp. and s. aureus which had mean inhibition zone of 42.3+/-1.5 and 32.3+/-1.5 mm respectively. the results showed minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 1.563 mg/ml against escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. and 3.125 mg/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella typhi. the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus was 0.39 mg/ml. this study has justified the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of stomach discomfort, diarrhea, dysentery and as a remedy for wound healing whose causative agents are some of the organisms used in this study.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of crude extracts from plants bryophyllum pinnatum and kalanchoe crenata.
extracts from the leaves of bryophyllum pinnatum and kalanchoe crenata were screened for their antimicrobial activities. solvents used included water, methanol, and local solvents such as palmwine, local gin (seaman's schnapps 40% alcoholic drink,) and "omi ekan-ogi" (sour water from 3 days fermented milled maize). leaves were dried and powdered before being soaked in solvents for 3 days. another traditional method of extraction by squeezing raw juice from the leaves was also employed. all extracts were lyophilized. these extracts were tested against some gram-negative organisms (escherichia coli atcc 25922, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella paratyphi, citrobacter spp); gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus atcc 25213, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis) and a fungus (candida albicans). agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at concentrations of 512 mg/ml to 4 mg/ml. all the organisms except candida albicans were susceptible to the extracts obtained from the traditional method. the squeezed-leaf juice of kalanchoe crenata was the most active one with mic of 8 mg/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus subtilis, 32 mg/ml against shigella flexneri, 64 mg/ml against escherichia coli and 128 mg/ml against the control strain staphylococcus aureus while its mbc is 256 mg/ml against these organisms except bacillus subtilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. the gram-positive organisms were more sensitive to the methanol and local gin-extract of bryophyllum pinnatum. extracts from other solvents showed moderate to weak activity.
antimicrobial activity of diterpenoids from hairy roots of salvia sclarea l.: salvipisone as a potential anti-biofilm agent active against antibiotic resistant staphylococci.
the antimicrobial activities of crude dichloromethane fractions from acetone extracts of agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed roots and roots of field-grown plants of salvia sclarea as well as four pure abietane diterpenoids isolated from the hairy root cultures were determined. the growth of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis) but not gram-negative ones (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) or pathogenic fungi (candida albicans) was inhibited by fractions tested at concentrations of 37.5-75.0 microgml(-1). abietane diterpenoids: salvipisone, aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were shown to be bacteriostatic as well as bacteriocidal for the cultures of s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains, regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. this was demonstrated by using simultaneously the optical density measuring method and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-reduction assay. the highest activity was shown by salvipisone which demonstrated also a very interesting activity when its effect on 24-h-old staphylococcal biofilm cells viability was examined. it limited the survival of biofilms formed by s. aureus as well as by s. epidermidis, putting this compound to the list of potential anti-biofilm agents, better than most of known antibiotics.
catharanthus roseus flower extract has wound-healing activity in sprague dawley rats.
background: catharanthus roseus l (c. roseus) has been used to treat a wide assortment of diseases including diabetes. the objective of our study was to evaluate the antimicrobial and wound healing activity of the flower extract of catharanthus in rats. methods: wound healing activity was determined in rats, after administration (100 mg kg-1 day-1) of the ethanol extract of c. roseus flower, using excision, incision and dead space wounds models. the animals were divided into two groups of 6 each in all the models. in the excision model, group 1 animals were topically treated with carboxymethyl cellulose as placebo control and group 2 received topical application of the ethanol extract of c. roseus at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight/day. in an incision and dead space model group 1 animals were given normal saline and group 2 received the extract orally at a dose of 100 mg kg-1 day-1. healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, period of epithelization, tensile strength (skin breaking strength), granulation tissue weight, and hydoxyproline content. antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against four microorganisms was also assessed results: the extract of c. roseus significantly increased the wound breaking strength in the incision wound model compared with controls (p < 0.001). the extract-treated wounds were found to epithelialize faster, and the rate of wound contraction was significantly increased in comparison to control wounds (p < 0.001), wet and dry granulation tissue weights, and hydroxyproline content in a dead space wound model increased significantly (p < 0.05). pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus demonstrated sensitivity to c. roseus conclusion: increased wound contraction and tensile strength, augmented hydroxyproline content along with antimicrobial activity support the use of c. roseus in the topical management of wound healing.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2004)].
from october 2004 to september 2005, we collected the specimen from 319 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 383 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 381 strains were examined. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 87, streptococcus pneumoniae 80, haemophilus influenzae 78, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 35, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 9, klebsiella pneumoniae 15, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 30, etc. of 87 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-sensitive s. aureus: mssa) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) were 40 (46.0%) and 47 (54.0%) strains, respectively. against mssa, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml. against mrsa, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. arbekacin (abk) also showed the potent activity and its mic90 was 2 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/ml. cefozopran (czop) also had a preferable activity (mic90: 1 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. in contrast, there were high-resistant strains (mic: 128 microg/ml or more) for abk (2.5%), erythromycin (37.5%), and clindamycin (38.8%). against h. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 microg/ml. meropenem showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), amikacin (amk) had the most potent activity and its mic90 was 4 microg/ml. the activity of czop against the non-mucoid type also was preferable and its mic90 was 8 microg/ml. against k. pneumoniae, czop, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, flomoxef were the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml. also, all the agents generally showed a potent activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis and the mic90 of them were 4 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (57.0%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 50.8% and 23.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (21.6%), s. pneumoniae (24.7%) and h. influenzae (20.1%). s. aureus (20.9%), s. pneumoniae (16.1%), and h. influenzae (16.1%) also were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (22.3%) and h. influenzae (25.1%). the bacteria relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were p. aeruginosa and the isolation frequency was 43.5%.
synthesis, characterization and in vitro biological studies of novel cyano derivatives of n-alkyl and n-aryl piperazine.
cyano derivatives of n-alkyl and n-aryl piperazine have been synthesized and screened for antibacterial and antifungal activities. all the synthesized compounds showed the antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains of staphylococcus aureus (mtccb 737), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mtccb 741), streptomyces epidermidis (mtccb 1824) and escherichia coli (mtccb 1652) and antifungal activity against pathogenic strains of aspergillus fumigatus (itcc 4517), aspergillus flavus (itcc 5192) and aspergillus niger (itcc 5405). all compounds showed mild to moderate antimicrobial activity. however, compounds 3c, 4a and 6 showed potent antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains used in the study. compounds 3a, 3b, 4b, and 4d showed mild to moderate antifungal activity against aspergillus pathogenic strains. the compounds reported in this study were assessed for there cytotoxicity using mtt colorimetric assay on hela cells. all the compounds showed cell viability more than the control drug gentamicin, with compound 2 having highest i.e. 95% cell viability.
antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
in the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-o-alpha-l-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-o-alpha-l-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. on the other hand, both dna virus herpes simplex (hsv) and rna virus parainfluenza-3 (pi-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using madin-darby bovine kidney and vero cell lines. according to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against s. aureus and e. faecalis with mic values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by e. coli (2 microg/ml), k. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), a. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and b. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited c. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. however, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards pi-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (cpe).
a novel host defense system of airways is defective in cystic fibrosis.
rationale: the respiratory tract is constantly exposed to airborne microorganisms. nevertheless, normal airways remain sterile without recruiting phagocytes. this innate immune activity has been attributed to mucociliary clearance and antimicrobial polypeptides of airway surface liquid. defective airway immunity characterizes cystic fibrosis (cf), a disease caused by mutations in the cf transmembrane conductance regulator, a chloride channel. the pathophysiology of defective immunity in cf remains to be elucidated. objective: we investigated the ability of non-cf and cf airway epithelia to kill bacteria through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros). methods: ros production and ros-mediated bactericidal activity were determined on the apical surfaces of human and rat airway epithelia and on cow tracheal explants. measurements and main results: dual oxidase enzyme of airway epithelial cells generated sufficient h(2)o(2) to support production of bactericidal hypothiocyanite (oscn(-)) in the presence of airway surface liquid components lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate (scn(-)). this oscn(-) formation eliminated staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa on airway mucosal surfaces, whereas it was nontoxic to the host. in contrast to normal epithelia, cf epithelia failed to secrete scn(-), thereby rendering the oxidative antimicrobial system inactive. conclusions: these data indicate a novel innate defense mechanism of airways that kills bacteria via ros and suggest a new cellular and molecular basis for defective airway immunity in cf.
[bacteria isolated from pleural fluid and their resistance to antimicrobials].
the aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of microorganisms isolated from pleural fluids and their resistance to antimicrobial agents. a total of 272 pleural fluids were studied between july 2004 - july 2005 from the patients hospitalized in icu/surgery (127) and respiratory diseases wards (145) at marius nasta institute. the laboratory investigations included: direct microscopy, cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, identification, disk diffusion method according with clsi recommendations for resistance and etest for detection of metallo-beta-lactamase producing isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. microorganisms were isolated from 159 samples (58.4%), 48 pleural fluids were positive only in microscopy (17.6%). the most frequent isolated strain was p. aeruginosa (49.6%), followed by staphylococcus aureus (12.8%) and enterobacteriaceae (11.2%) polymicrobial infections were mostly due to combinations of pseudomonas with enterobacteriaceae. for p. aeruginosa the resistance rate was higher than 71% for all beta-lactams. for aminoglycosides the lower resistance rate was to amikacin (18.0%). for quinolones, resistance of p. aeruginosa was 67.8% to ciprofloxacin. p. aeruginosa isolated from patients hospitalized in icu/surgery were more resistant to some antimicrobials than the strains isolated in the respiratory diseases wards: resistance to amikacin was 24.5% versus 10% respectively. from 21 p. aeruginosa imipenem and multidrug resistant strains tested, 3 were probably producing of metallo-beta-lactamase. s. aureus showed 47.1% oxacillin resistance, 38.9% resistance to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin and 27.7% to erythromycin. all s.aureus strains were susceptible to linezolid, teicoplanin and vancomycin. the resistance of enterobacteriaceae strains was high to ampicillin (80.0%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole e(57.6%); the lowest resistance rate was to cefoperazone/sulbactam (7.7%) and to imipenem and ciprofloxacin (10.8%).
antimicrobial disinfection effect of a laundering procedure for hospital textiles against various indicator bacteria and fungi using different substrates for simulating human excrements.
recent studies confirm the increase of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. one of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate laundering procedures. most slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. in addition to this fact, there is an increasing number of hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. on the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. in our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium terrae, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating human excrements and were inoculated together with the chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions. it was found that e. faecium, s. aureus, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa survived at 60 degrees c, but no microorganisms were found at 75 degrees c.
treatment options for multidrug-resistant bacteria.
as a consequence of antibiotic overuse and misuse, nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria represent a physician's nightmare throughout the world. no newer antimicrobials active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the main multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen, are available or under investigation. the only exceptions are linezolid, some newer glycopeptides (dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin) and daptomycin (a lipopeptide), which are active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains, as well as tigecycline, a potent in vitro glycylcycline against mrsa, vre, acinetobacter baumannii and entended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)+ enterobacteriaceae. colistin, an antibiotic of the 1950s has been rediscovered by intensive care unit physicians for use against esbl+ enterobacteriaceae, as well as against multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates. although success rates with colistin range between 50 and 73%, almost all studies are retrospective. immunostimulation efforts against s. aureus are still under development. as antibiotic research and development stagnate, rational policies for prescribing existing antibiotics plus strict infection control are the current mainstay efforts for preventing and combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
enhanced membrane disruption and antibiotic action against pathogenic bacteria by designed histidine-rich peptides at acidic ph.
the histidine-rich amphipathic cationic peptide lah4 has antibiotic and dna delivery capabilities. here, we explore the interaction of peptides from this family with model membranes as monitored by solid-state (2)h nuclear magnetic resonance and their antibiotic activities against a range of bacteria. at neutral ph, the membrane disruption is weak, but at acidic ph, the peptides strongly disturb the anionic lipid component of bacterial membranes and cause bacterial lysis. the peptides are effective antibiotics at both ph 7.2 and ph 5.5, although the antibacterial activity is strongly affected by the change in ph. at neutral ph, the lah peptides were active against both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive staphylococcus aureus strains but ineffective against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in contrast, the lah peptides were highly active against p. aeruginosa in an acidic environment, as is found in the epithelial-lining fluid of cystic fibrosis patients. our results show that modest antibiotic activity of histidine-rich peptides can be dramatically enhanced by inducing membrane disruption, in this case by lowering the ph, and that histidine-rich peptides have potential as future antibiotic agents.
comparative in vitro efficacies and antimicrobial durabilities of novel antimicrobial central venous catheters.
we investigated the efficacies and durability of novel antimicrobial central venous catheters (cvcs) in preventing the adherence of microbial organisms to the surfaces of the cvcs. novel antimicrobial cvcs investigated in this in vitro study were impregnated with antibiotics (minocycline and rifampin), with oligon agent (silver, platinum, and carbon black), with approved antiseptics (chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine), or with a novel antiseptic agent, gendine, which contains gentian violet and chlorhexidine. when tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa, gendine-coated cvc segments provided protection against bacterial adherence significantly more than all other types of tested cvcs (p < 0.05). gendine-coated cvcs also provided better protection against candida albicans and candida parapsilosis than cvcs impregnated with antibiotics or with silver, platinum, and carbon (p < 0.02). after 28 days of being soaked in serum, the cvcs impregnated with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine and the cvcs impregnated with silver, platinum, and carbon had lost antimicrobial activity against mrsa, p. aeruginosa, and c. parapsilosis, and the cvcs impregnated with minocycline and rifampin had lost activity against p. aeruginosa and c. parapsilosis. the cvcs impregnated with gendine maintained antimicrobial activities against mrsa, p. aeruginosa, and c. parapsilosis after 28 days of being soaked in serum. central venous catheters impregnated with the novel investigational antiseptic gendine showed in vitro efficacy and provided protection against bacterial adherence more than other approved novel antimicrobial-coated cvcs.
in vitro antibacterial activity of bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract.
the rapidly developing resistance of many infectious pathogenic organisms to modern drugs has spurred scientists to search for new sources of antibacterial compounds. one potential candidate, bdle (dialysis at 10 to 12 kda cut-off) and its fractions ("s" and "l" by 3.5 kda cut-off and i, ii, iii, and iv by molecular exclusion chromatography), was evaluated for antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, lysteria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi) using standard antimicrobial assays. a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of bdle and its fractions was determined by agar and broth dilutions methods. only bdle and its "s" fraction had an effect upon all bacteria evaluated (mic ranging from 0.29 to 0.62 u/ml), and the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects (evaluated by mtt assay) were bacterial species-dependent. these results showed a remarkable in vitro antibacterial property of bdle against several pathogenic bacteria.
toxicogenomic response of staphylococcus aureus to peracetic acid.
staphylococcus aureus is responsible for many incidents of hospital-acquired infection, which causes 90,000 deaths and dollars 4.5 billion loss a year in the united states. despite a wide use of disinfectants such as peracetic acid in health care environments, we certainly need better understanding of the effects of antimicrobial application on target pathogens to avert infection outbreaks. consequently, herein, we explored for the first time the toxicogenomic response of s. aureus to a sublethal concentration of peracetic acid (1 mm) by using microarray-based transcriptome analysis. in particular, we investigated the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during its cellular response, which involved initial growth inhibition (10 min) and subsequent partial recovery (20 min). further, we compared transcriptome responses to peracetic acid between s. aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. our findings show that (i) the regulation of membrane transport genes was significantly altered, (ii) dna repair and replication genes were selectively induced, and (iii) primary metabolism-related genes were differently repressed between the two growth states. most intriguingly, we revealed that many virulence factor genes were induced upon the exposure, which proposes a possibilitythatthe pathogenesis of s. aureus may be stimulated in response to peracetic acid.
antibacterial activity of crude methanolic extract and its fractions of aerial parts of anthemis tinctoria.
the antibacterial activity of the methanolic extract and its fractions of aerial  parts of aniheinis tinctoria (asteraceae) was investigated against representative gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) and gram-negative strains escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853). the activity was concentrated mainly in the dichloromethane (dcm) and hexane fractions of crude methanolic extract. the 5 mg of dcm extract per disk produced 15-16 mm of inhibition zone against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, however, no activity was found against e. faecalis and e. coli. the hexane fraction showed activity against s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis. as dcm fraction showed the highest antibacterial activity in the disk diffusion assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) values of only this fraction was determined against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. these values were found to be in the range of 1.25 to 10 mg/ml.
different photoresponses of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa to 514, 532, and 633 nm low level lasers in vitro.
low level light irradiation (llli) may proliferate cell growth at certain conditions during a set of photochemical reactions called biostimulation. however, phototoxic inhibitory reactions after irradiating natural or artificially inoculated cells are possible. the purpose of this study was to determine these effects on pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. ar ion laser at 514 nm was used to determine the effect of various energy densities of green light on these bacteria. the most effective energy densities of ar ion laser were chosen to irradiate both bacteria with he-ne (633 nm) and shg nd:yag (532 nm) lasers to compare the effect of red and green lights on the growth. irradiation of pseudomonas aeruginosa for both he-ne and shg nd:yag lasers in the presence of toluidine blue o or safranine o as photosensitizers was also studied. all energy densities of ar ion laser showed a proliferative effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibitory effect on staphylococcus aureus. similarly, shg nd:yag and he-ne lasers with chosen energy densities were again proliferating for pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibitory for staphylococcus aureus and shg nd:yag was more effective than he-ne in both cases. irradiation of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of both photosensitizers led to the decrease of the cell population compared to the control.
comparisons of parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporins tested against bacterial  isolates from pediatric patients: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998-2004).
a contemporary collection of 12737 strains from pediatric patients (<18 years) isolated over a 7-year period (1998-2004) from 52 sentinel hospitals in north america was tested to determine the comparative antimicrobial potency of broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporins and selected comparator agents. most of the strains (84.1%) were isolated from blood stream or respiratory tract infections. the rank order of the top 10 pediatric pathogens analyzed was streptococcus pneumoniae (15.5%) >haemophilus influenzae (14.6%) >staphylococcus aureus (13.8%) >moraxella catarrhalis = coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.0%) >escherichia coli (7.8%) >pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.2%) >klebsiella spp. (4.8%) >enterococcus spp. (4.7%) > beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.4%). both cefepime and ceftriaxone (mic(90), 1 microg/ml; 93.9% and 93.7% susceptible, respectively) were highly active against s. pneumoniae. however, the s. pneumoniae strains showed reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime (56.6%), as well as penicillin (56.6%) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (57.1%) < erythromycin (66.2%) < tetracycline (71.4%). beta-hemolytic streptococci showed 100.0% susceptibility to penicillin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone. cefepime and ceftriaxone exhibited high activity against oxacillin (methicillin)-susceptible s. aureus, (mic(90), 4 microg/ml; 100.0% and 99.8% susceptible, respectively), whereas ceftazidime (mic(90), 16 microg/ml) was active against only 86.7% of strains. h. influenzae strains showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin (mic(90), < or =0.5 microg/ml; 100.0%), and 34.0% of h. influenzae and 99.2% of m. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. although the 3 cephalosporins tested (cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) were very active (98.6-99.6% susceptible) against e. coli, cefepime (99.0% susceptible) was slightly more active than ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (96.4% and 95.1% susceptible, respectively) against klebsiella spp. cefepime was also the most active beta-lactam agent tested against enterobacter spp. (mic(90), 2 microg/ml; 99.3% susceptible), whereas the susceptibility rates of other broad-spectrum beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam) were significantly lower (78.4-81.5%). against p. aeruginosa, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed the highest susceptibility rates (94.4% and 93.3%, respectively), whereas imipenem and cefepime showed the lowest resistance rates (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively). our results indicate that cefepime was the most broad-spectrum cephalosporin analyzed and remains a very potent alternative for the treatment of contemporary pediatric infections in north america.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). i. susceptibility distribution].
the bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2004 and july 2005. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were measured. of them, 577 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the measurement. the strains consisted of 156 gram-positive bacterial strains (27.0%) and 421 gram-negative bacterial strains (73.0%). against staphylococcus aureus, arbekacin (abk), vancomycin (vcm) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/ml. against enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (abpc) and vcm showed a strong antibacterial activity. the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially cefozopran (czop) and cefpirome (cpr) showed the strongest activity (mic90: < or = 125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli [mic of ciprofloxacin (cpfx): > or = 4 microg/ml] was detected at frequency of 18.8%, which was higher than that in the last year. against klebsiella pneumoniae, czop, meropenem (mepm), and carumonam (crmn) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. the antibacterial activity of the other cephems was relatively good, and decrease in their activity observed in the last year study was not recognized. against serratia marcescens, imipenem (ipm) and gentamicin (gm) had the strongest antibacterial activity. against proteus mirabilis, crmn showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. mepm prevented the growth of all strains with 0.25 microg/ml. next, cefmenoxime (cmx), ceftazidime (caz), czop, cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), and cefditoren (cdtr) showed a strong activity. the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and mic90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to > 128 microg/ml except ipm and mepm having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activities of czop and caz were considered to be relatively good on mic50 comparison (mic50: 2 microg/ml).
influence of patient age on the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates from hematology/oncology patients: report from the chemotherapy alliance for neutropenics and the control of emerging resistance program (north america).
the chemotherapy alliance for neutropenics and the control of emerging resistance program (cancer) monitored the susceptibility of pathogens recovered in hematology/oncology centers from 2000 to 2002. a total of 3970 isolates from 32 hospitals (26 united states, 6 canada) were analyzed at a central location (jmi laboratories, north liberty, ia) for trends in pathogen occurrence and reference antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. the top 5 ranking pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (19.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (14.1%), escherichia coli (13.4%), enterococcus spp. (10.2%), and klebsiella spp. (9.5%). a total of 35.5% of s. aureus and 78.8% of cons were resistant to oxacillin, whereas 22.0% of enterococcus spp. were resistant to vancomycin. e. coli and klebsiella spp. were highly susceptible (>90%) to piperacillin/tazobactam, 3rd-generation cephalosporins, and ciprofloxacin, but 3.9% and 2.4% of these species, respectively, met screening criteria for extended spectrum beta-lactamase production. enterobacter spp. were less susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone (83.7-88.2%) because of amp c production and were most inhibited by cefepime and imipenem. amikacin and polymyxin b were very active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (97.4-97.7% susceptible). prevalence of s. aureus, e. coli, enterobacter spp., and klebsiella spp. increased significantly (+48% to 98%) with age, whereas cons and viridans group streptococci decreased markedly (-62% to 69%) with advancing age. the isolation of gram-positive pathogens declined (55% to 47%) with age (< or =14 to > or =65 years). fluoroquinolones generally exhibited decreased susceptibility with increased age against nearly all listed pathogens. oxacillin resistance rates for s. aureus increased with age (6-46%) as did vancomycin resistance rates for enterococci (nil in < or =14 years group to 18-24% in adults). pathogens infecting neutropenic patients did not reflect greater resistance than those found in the general hospitalized patients. gram-positive organisms were only slightly more predominant (53.4%), and cited age-related variations in pathogen occurrence and/or susceptibility patterns by species must be considered for empiric regimes for hematology and oncology patients.
bafoudiosbulbins a, and b, two anti-salmonellal clerodane diterpenoids from dioscorea bulbifera l. var sativa.
two clerodane diterpenoids, bafoudiosbulbins a 1, and b 2, together with five known compounds: tetracosanoic acid, 1-(tetracosanoyl)-glycerol, trans-tetracosanylferulate, beta-sitosterol and 3-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-beta-sitosterol were isolated from the tubers of dioscorea bulbifera l. var sativa. their structures were established by spectroscopic methods (1d and 2d-nmr, ms) and x-ray crystallographic diffraction analysis of compound 1. the ch2cl2-soluble portion of the crude extract and the two clerodanes were screened for anti-bacterial activity using both agar diffusion and broth dilution techniques against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, salmonella paratyphi a and salmonella paratyphi b. they both showed significant activities against p. aeruginosa, s. typhi, s. paratyphi a and s. paratyphi b.
antimicrobial susceptibility of community and hospital acquired bacteria.
objectives: to study the antibiotic susceptibility of common community- and hospital-acquired bacteria in thailand. material and method: eight common bacterial pathogens were studied in 24 hospitals across thailand in 2002-2003. isolates of clinically proven infections were tested for their susceptibility by agar-based disc diffusion method. results: a total of 9,091 isolates of target bacteria were studied. community and hospital acquired bacteria accounted for 54.9% and 45.1% respectively. community acquired escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., enterobacter spp., staphylococcus aureus were more susceptible to antimicrobials compared to hospital acquired strains. the difference in susceptibility of community-acquired vs hospital acquired pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus spp. was less impressive indicating the spread of hospital strains into the community. bacteria isolated from the blood stream were more susceptible to antimicrobials compared to those from the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical sites. acinetobacter spp. and enterococcus spp. were less susceptible to antimicrobials compared to others. conclusion: decreased susceptibility to antimicrobials was found in all bacteria tested. the susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobials of community-acquired bacteria decreased to a critical level indicating the widespread resistant bacteria to the community.
antimicrobial effect of silver-doped phosphate-based glasses.
in this study a range of phosphate-based glasses (pbg) doped with silver have been investigated for their antimicrobial activities. in disk diffusion assays, these compositions demonstrated microbistatic effects against a range of organisms including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. the data obtained from the above studies allowed for an additional range of pbg containing lower amounts of silver to be studied for their effects on the growth and viability of s. aureus, e. coli, and c. albicans. pbg containing 3 and 5 mol % ag were bactericidal for s. aureus and e. coli and significantly decreased the growth rate of c. albicans. a decrease in the dissolution rates of the glasses was seen with increasing ag content over the range of concentrations investigated. overall, 3 mol % ag incorporated into the pbg investigated was sufficient to mount a potent antibacterial effect against the test organisms, and these compositions also gave excellent long-term release of ag ions into the medium.
comparison of antimicrobial effects of dexmedetomidine and etomidate-lipuro with  those of propofol and midazolam.
background and objectives: the aim of our study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of dexmedetomidine and etomidate-lipuro, and to compare these effects with those of midazolam and propofol on staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeroginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase escherichia coli ( e. coli esbl). methods: all hypnotic dilutions were exposed to micro-organisms for 0, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min at room temperature in vitro. the inoculums taken from diluted suspensions were re-inoculated on blood agar and incubated for 18-24 h at 35 degrees c after which a count of the colonies was compared. results: midazolam reduced the viable cells of s. aureus at 30, 60, 120 and 240 min, and also completely inhibited the growth of e. coli, p. aeroginosa, a. baumannii and e. coli esbl. dexmedetomidine, etomidate-lipuro and propofol, however, did not inhibit any of the micro-organisms tested. conclusion: in vitro, midazolam had an antimicrobial effect on e. coli, p. aeroginosa, a. baumannii and e. coli esbl. like propofol and dexmedetomidine, etomidate-lipuro had no antimicrobial effect on any of the micro-organisms tested.
antimicrobial activity of substance p and neuropeptide y against laboratory strains of bacteria and oral microorganisms.
infection and inflammation of mucosal tissue may induce the production of neuropeptides, specifically substance p and neuropeptide y. since these neuropeptides are similar to antimicrobial peptides in their amino acid composition, amphipathic design, cationic charge, and size, we wanted to determine if they had antimicrobial activity against a panel of common bacteria and oral microorganisms using the radial diffusion assay. neuropeptide y and substance p had antimicrobial activity against e. coli (mic 20.6+/-5.5 microg/ml sem and 71.5+/-15 sem microg/ml, respectively), but did not have activity against laboratory strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (mic>500 microg/ml) nor oral strains of streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (mic>500 microg/ml). while substance p and neuropeptide y did not have direct antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested, they still may stimulate local epithelial cells to produce other innate immune factors like defensins and cathelicidins. however, this remains to be determined.
quinine sulfate inhibits invasion of some bacterial skin pathogens.
background: as some of the many patients who receive antimalarials for the treatment of noninfective inflammatory diseases (lupus erythematosus, collagen vascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and others) are also immunosuppressed because of their disease and/or treatments, and may have concomitant bacterial infections, we investigated the effect of these drugs on the growth and invasion of several bacteria that are commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections to determine whether they could protect against such conditions and obviate the need for an additional antibiotic drug. methods: the effect of quinine sulfate (qs) at concentrations of 50 and 100 microm on the entry process of enterobacter agglomerans, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae into caco-2 cells was studied during the infection period. the invasive efficiency was expressed as the number of viable internalized bacteria obtained by counting the colony-forming units (cfus). results: the invasive ability of e. agglomerans and s. aureus was significantly inhibited by 50 and 100 microm qs in a dose-dependent manner when the drug was added to caco-2 cell monolayers during the infection period; however, qs had no significant effect on the internalization of p. aeruginosa or k. pneumoniae. discussion and conclusions: antimalarial drugs are currently widely used to treat patients with autoimmune dermatologic and rheumatologic diseases, and have also been recently proposed as additional therapy for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. these patients, who are often immunocompromised, may receive a secondary advantage from these antimalarials, which may provide some protection against staphylococci (amongst the most important human pathogens causing many superficial and systemic infections) and e. agglomerans.
antimicrobial and toxicological evaluation of the leaves of baissea axillaries hua used in the management of hiv/aids patients.
background: persistent diarrhea is a common endemic disease with high incidence among the africans including nigerians. it also represents a frequent opportunistic disease in people living with hiv. diarrhea represents one of the most distressful and persistent symptoms of hiv/aids, which may or may not be accompanied by an infection. the leaves decoction of baissea axillaries hua (apocynaceae) is used by traditional herbalists in edo state, nigeria for the management of people living with hiv/aids. determination of its antimicrobial activity and toxicological profile will provide supportive scientific evidence in favour of its continuous usage. method: chemical and chromatographic tests were employed in phytochemical investigations. inhibitory activities of aqueous and ethanolic extracts against clinical strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were compared with togamycin (spectinomycin). our report includes minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against the test organisms. toxicological evaluation was determined by administering 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg of extracts on male wister rats for 14 days with normal saline as control. the kidneys, liver, heart and testis tissues were examined. results: phytochemical studies revealed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, and cyanogenetic glycosides. the extracts inhibited the growth of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus to varying extents, but only the ethanolic extract inhibited growth in streptococcus faecalis. the ld50 of the extract in mice was above 5000 mg/kg body weight when administered intraperitoneally. toxicological evaluation showed mere ballooning degeneration of the liver at 250 mg/kg while at 500 mg/kg there was tissue necrosis. the low and high doses showed ill-defined leydig cells in the testis and no remarkable changes in the heart and kidneys. conclusion: extracts of baissea axillaries have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against clinical strains of selected microorganisms. while there is toxicity at the dose of 500 mg/kg, the therapy shows potential for application in the treatment of diarrhoea associated with aids/hiv. further studies of baissea axillaries on diarrhoea and toxicity are necessary to evaluate its mechanism of action and to fully establish its safety profile.
antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of some sulfonamide-derived chromones.
a series of antibacterial and antifungal sulfonamide (sulfanilamide, sulfaguanidine, sulfamethaxozole, 4-aminoethylbenzene-sulfonamide and 4-amino-6-trifluoromethyl-benzene-1,3-disulfonamide) derived chromones, previously reported as inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase, have been screened for in-vitro antibacterial activity against four gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and shigella flexener) and two gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus) bacterial strains, and for in-vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, candida glaberata. all compounds (1)-(5) showed significant antibacterial activity against all four gram-negative species and both gram-positive species. however, three of them, (1), (4) and (5), were found to be comparatively much more active compared to (2) and (3). of these, (5) was found to be the most active one. for antifungal activity, generally compounds (1) and (2) showed significant activity against more than three strains whereas (3)-(5) also showed significant activity against varied fungal strains. in the brine shrimp bioassay for in-vitro cytotoxic properties, only two compounds, (4) and (5) displayed potent cytotoxic activity, ld50 = 2.732 x 10(-4)m) and ld50 = 2.290 x 10(-4)m) respectively, against artemia salina.
influence of day and night wear on surface properties of silicone hydrogel contact lenses and bacterial adhesion.
purpose: the aim of this study was to determine the effect of continuous wear on  physicochemical surface properties of silicone hydrogel (s-h) lenses and their susceptibility to bacterial adhesion. methods: in this study, volunteers wore 2 pairs of either "lotrafilcon a" or "balafilcon a" s-h contact lenses. the first pair was worn continuously for a week and the second pair for 4 weeks. one lens of each pair was used for surface characterization and the other one for bacterial adhesion experiments. lens surfaces were characterized by examination of their wettability, roughness, elemental composition, and proteins attached to their surfaces. adhesion of staphylococcus aureus 835 and pseudomonas aeruginosa #3 to a lens was studied using a parallel plate flow chamber. results: before use, the lotrafilcon a lens was rougher than the balafilcon a lens and had a lower water contact angle and a higher affinity for s. aureus 835. after wear, both lens types had similar water contact angles, whereas the differences in elemental surface composition decreased as well. s. aureus 835 adhered in higher numbers to worn balafilcon a lenses, whereas the opposite was seen for p. aeruginosa #3. the initial deposition rates of both bacterial strains to lotrafilcon a lenses decreased by wearing and were found to correlate significant (p < 0.001) with the surface roughness of worn lenses. conclusions: in this study, the differences in surface properties between 2 types of s-h lenses were found to change after 1 week of continuous wear. generally, bacteria adhered in lower numbers and less tenaciously to worn lenses, except s. aureus 835, adhering in higher numbers to worn balafilcon a lenses.
bacterial killing by heparin-binding peptides from prelp and thrombospondin.
antimicrobial peptides (amp) are effector molecules of the innate immune system.  a cross-functionality exists between amps and heparin-binding peptides. here, we show that the peptides qptrrprpgtgpgrrprprprp (qpt22), derived from proline arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein (prelp) and krfkqdggwshwspwss (krf17) from thrombospondin exert antimicrobial activities against the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against the gram-positive bacillus subtilis. analysis by fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that qpt22 and krf17 bind to bacterial membranes. particularly qpt22 was found to induce membrane leakage of liposomes. the peptides displayed no hemolytic activities, nor did they exert membrane permeabilising effects on human epithelial cells. additional peptides derived from heparin-binding regions of laminin, vitronectin, and fibronectin exerted similar antibacterial effects. several peptides also showed activity against staphylococcus aureus. thus, the data disclose a novel antimicrobial activity of heparin-binding regions of matrix glycoproteins. the findings can be utilized in the development of novel amps for therapeutic use.
antimicrobial activity of znii, cdii, and hgii complexes of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-r)-1h-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols and 1,4-bis-[2-(5-r)-1h-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols.
1,2-bis-[2-(5-h/me/cl/no2)-1h-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (l1-l4), 1,4-bis-[2-(5-h/me/cl)-1h-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (l5-l7) and their complexes with zncl2, cdcl2 and hgcl2 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans. hgii complexes have a considerably higher antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms. some hgii complexes show higher antifungal activity than clotrimazole toward c. albicans. zn2(l3)cl4, zn2(l4)cl4, and cd(l3)cl2 were moderately effective against s. aureus and s. epidermidis; cd(l4)cl2 exhibited a weak activity only against s. epidermidis.
antimicrobial activity of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-r)-1h-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2-ethanediols, 1,4-bis-[2-(5-r)-1h-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2,3,4-butanetetraols and their feiii, cuii, and agi complexes.
1,2-bis-[2-(5-h/me/cl/no2)-1h-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (l1-l4), 1,4-bis-[2-(5-h/me/cl)-1h-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (l5-l7) and their complexes with fecl3, cucl2, and agno3 were synthesized; antibacterial activity of the compounds was determined toward staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis, and antifungal activity against candida albicans. the agi complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. some agi complexes show higher activity toward s. epidermidis than agno3 and cefuroxime. cu(l3)cl2 and fe(l3)cl3 show an antifungal effect on c. albicans but l3 itself has no activity.
[antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms isolated from patients with urinary  tract infections in 2002].
using the agar dilution method, the antibacterial activity of 18 antibiotics inclusive of 4 carbapenems were investigated against 101 strains of urinary pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections who visited the department of urology at kagoshima university hospital, between january and december 2002. 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 3 strains of staphylococcus spp. (exclusive of s. aureus), 14 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of enterococcus spp. (exclusive of e. faecalis), 41 strains of escherichia coli, 21 strains of enterobacteriaceae (exclusive of e. coli), 12 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 strains of glucose-nonfermentative gram-negative rods (exclusive of p. aeruginosa) were examined. 1. against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, vancomycin and teicoplanin were active. additionally, arbekacin was active against s. aureus clinical isolates and ampicillin was active against e. faecalis clinical isolates. carbapenems were active against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains of gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant s. aureus. 2. as for clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria, meropenem was most active against enterobacteriaceae among 13 antibiotics tested. against p. aeruginosa clinical isolates, mic90 of meropenem was the lowest among 13 antibiotics tested. in addition, resistant rate of meropenem and biapenem against p. aeruginosa clinical isolates was lower than those of the other carbapenems tested. 3. as main urinary pathogens showed no remarkable increase in resistance to carbapenems, it can be stated that carbapenems retain their position as the drug of first choice for severe infection.
are multidose over-the-counter artificial tears adequately preserved?
purpose: to investigate artificial tears containing different preservatives for antimicrobial efficacy. based on the challenge test outlined in the european pharmacopoeia, products were tested in their original containers to see whether their component preservative had sufficient activity. methods: five brands of over-the-counter artificial tears each containing different preservatives (benzalkonium chloride/edta, parabens, chlorobutanol, silver chloride complex, and purite-stabilized oxychloro complex) were inoculated with test microorganisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans). changes in the microbial start concentration with time were followed by plating onto growth media to provide a measure of the preservative efficacy. in another test, artificial tears were applied to paper disks that were then placed onto agar growth media seeded with microorganisms. zones of inhibition were measured after incubation. results: only the brand of artificial tears containing benzalkonium chloride/edta satisfied the major criteria for antimicrobial preservation for all the test microorganisms. only a benzalkonium chloride/edta-containing disk placed on agar seeded with s. aureus produced a zone of inhibition in the agar diffusion test. conclusion: the brand of artificial tears containing benzalkonium chloride/edta is suitable for sale in countries adopting the monographs of the european pharmacopoeia. other brands would only be suitable for sale if justified reasons for not meeting the major criteria for preservative efficacy can be provided.
the effect of temperature on the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs.
purpose: to determine the survival of different bacteria inoculated in optisol-gs at refrigerated storage temperature (6 degrees c) and after subsequent warming to room temperature (19-22 degrees c). methods: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were chosen from stock clinical isolates for inclusion in the study. the first group consisted of 12 optisol-gs vials. the second group consisted of 12 optisol-gs vials containing corneas inappropriate for transplantation according to the eye bank association of america (ebaa) protocols. each group was inoculated with 3 concentrations of approximately 10, 10, and 10 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of each bacterial species and then refrigerated per ebaa protocol. after 48 hours of refrigeration, all vials were placed at room temperature (rt) and counts were performed at 48, 50 (2 hour rt), 54 (6 hour rt), 60 (12 hour rt), 72 (24 hour rt), and 96 (48 hour rt) hours. at 96 hours, the corneal tissue from 10 and 10 inocula were cultured. all samples underwent serial dilution, spiral plating on blood agar plates, and incubation at 35 degrees c. viable colony counts were determined at 24 hours. results: except for the 10 cfu/ml inocula of p. aeruginosa, all isolates were viable after 48 hours of refrigeration. rapid bactericidal activity was observed against p. aeruginosa after 2 hours at rt, with complete sterilization by 6 hours. the rate and extent of killing against s. aureus were influenced by the initial inoculum. bactericidal activity was achieved after 2 hours at rt with 10 cfu/ml of s. aureus versus 24 hours with the 10 inoculum. of note, bactericidal activity was not observed against s. pneumoniae and e. faecium following 24 hours of storage at rt. the presence of corneal tissue did not affect viable counts, with counts from corneal tissue cultures reflecting the counts seen from optisol-gs after 48 hours at rt. conclusions: the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs was reduced at refrigerated temperature and enhanced at rt. bactericidal activity was not observed against e. faecium at either refrigerated temperature or rt.
the anti-microbial activity of electrolysed oxidizing water against microorganisms relevant in veterinary medicine.
standards of the german association of veterinary medicine (dvg) for the evaluation of chemical disinfectants were used to assess the anti-microbial efficacy of electrolysed oxidizing water (eow). enterococcus faecium, mycobacterium avium subspecies avium, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans were exposed to anode eow (ph, 3.0+/-0.1; oxidation-reduction potential (orp), +1100+/-50 mv; free chlorine, 400+/-20 mg/l cl2) and combined eow (7:3 anode:cathode, v/v; ph, 8.3+/-0.1; orp, 930-950 mv; free chlorine, 271+/-20 mg/l cl2). in water of standardized hardness (wsh), all bacterial strains were completely inactivated by a 30 min exposure to maximum 10.0% anode eow (approximately 40.0 mg/l cl2) or 50.0% combined eow (approximately 135.5 mg/l cl2). the sensitivity ranking order for anode eow to the bacterial test strains was p. mirabilis>s. aureus>m. avium ssp. avium>e. faecium>p. aeruginosa. p. mirabilis and s. aureus decreased to undetectable levels after 5 min of exposure to 7.5% anode eow (approximately 30.0 mg/l cl2). candida albicans was completely inactivated by a 5-min exposure to 5.0% anode eow. both, anode and combined eow exhibited no anti-microbial activities in standardized nutrient broth or after addition of 20.0% bovine serum to the wsh. further research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of eow as a disinfectant under operating conditions in animal production facilities.
decreased bacterial clearance from the lungs of mice following primary respiratory syncytial virus infection.
virus respiratory infections often precede bacterial pneumonia in healthy individuals. in order to determine the potential role of respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) in bacterial secondary infections, a mouse sequential pulmonary infection model was developed. mice were exposed to rsv then challenged with streptococcus pneumoniae (stpn). exposure of balb/c mice to 10(6)-10(7) plaque forming units (pfu) of virus of rsv significantly decreased stpn clearance 1-7 days following rsv exposure. this finding was not restricted to stpn alone: exposure to rsv followed by staphylococcus aureus (sa) or pseudomonas aeruginosa(pa) resulted in similar decreases in bacterial clearance. both bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) cell counts and pulmonary histopathology demonstrated that rsv-stpn exposed mice had increased lung cellular inflammation compared to mice receiving stpn or rsv alone. the effect of rsv infection on bacterial clearance was dependent on the mouse genetic background: c57bl/6j mice (relatively resistant to rsv infection) demonstrated a modest change in stpn clearance following rsv exposure, whereas fvbn/j mice (similar to the balb/cj mice in rsv susceptibility) demonstrated a similar degree of rsv-associated decrease in stpn clearance 7 days following rsv exposure. neutrophils from the rsv-stpn sequentially exposed balb/cj mice were functionally altered-produced greater levels of peroxide production but less myeloperoxidase (mpo) compared to mice receiving stpn alone. these data demonstrate that rsv infection decreases bacterial clearance, potentially predisposing to secondary bacterial pneumonia despite increased lung cellular inflammation, and suggest that functional changes occur in the recruited neutrophils that may contribute to the decreased bacterial clearance.
antifungal and antibacterial activities of araucaria araucana (mol.) k. koch heartwood lignans.
five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an meoh extract from araucaria araucana (mol.) k. koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. the antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria citrobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi mucor miehei, paecilomyces variotii, ceratocystis pilifera, trametes versicolor, and penicillium notatum, and in addition, the meoh extract was evaluated against aspergillus niger, candida albicans, fusarium moniliforme, f. sporotrichum and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the gram-positive. however, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of t. versicolor and c. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. on the other hand, the meoh extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as t. versicolor, fusarium spp. and trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of plagiochasma appendiculatum lehm. et lind.
plagiochasma appendiculatum (aytoniaceae) of the order marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by gaddi tribe in kangra valley for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobical potential of plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. the plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi candida albicans and cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus spinulosus, aspergillus terreus and aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella typhimurium) with an mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.
in vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide schiff's bases and their cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes.
isonicotinoylhydrazide schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their co (ii), cu (ii), ni (ii) and zn (ii) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glabrata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. the brine shrimp bioassay indicated schiff's bases, l3 and l6 and, their cu (ii) and ni (ii) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (ld50 > 1000).
[the analysis of the isolated microorganisms from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients treated in children's memorial health institute 1999-2002].
the aim of the study was, to analyze the microorganisms cultured from materials from the airways of children with cystic fibrosis treated in the children's memorial health institute in warsaw during 1999-2002. a total of 411 samples were tested, obtained from the airways of 58 patients with diagnosed mucoviscidosis. the age of the treated patients was within the range of 1 month and 20 years. the bacteriological tests were taken during routine visits in the consultation and pulmonology clinic, which took place 3-4 times a year. the most often isolated strain was staphylococcus aureus--48%. 17% of the isolates of haemophilus influenzae and 13% of pseudomonas aeruginosa were obtained. most s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and h. infiuenzae isolates showed high susceptibility to tested antimicrobial agents. about 6% of all s. aureus isolates were resistant to methicillin (mrsa). s. aureus was occurring in all age groups with the same frequency. the rods h. influenzae were cultured more often from children under 10 years, while p. aeruginosa more often from older patients.
surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of invasive pathogens: the estonian experience.
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive gram-negative pathogens in estonia. the antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) protocols. despite the higher rate of gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for gram negative pathogens. the higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl)-producing strains was 23% among klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among e. coli. the inclusion of invasive gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). i. susceptibility distribution].
the bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2003 and july 2004. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. the strains consisted of 258 gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). against staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (vcm) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/ml. against streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (abpc), cefozopran (czop), imipenem (ipm), and clarithromycin (cam) showed a strong activity and the mic90 was 0.125 microg/ml or less. against enterococcus faecalis, vcm, abpc, and ipm showed a strong antibacterial activity. the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially czop and cefpirome (cpr) showed the strongest activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli [mic of ciprofloxacin (cpfx): > or =4 microg/ml] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. against klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (mepm) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of crmn and czop was good. the antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. against serratia marcescens, mepm had the strongest antibacterial activity. against proteus mirabilis, mepm and crmn showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. nest, cefmenoxime (cmx), ceftazidime (caz), cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cpr, czop, and cefditoren (cdtr) showed a strong activity. the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and mic90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/ml except ipm and amikacin (amk) having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of czop was relatively good (mic50: 2 microg/ml).
chelator-induced dispersal and killing of pseudomonas aeruginosa cells in a biofilm.
biofilms consist of groups of bacteria attached to surfaces and encased in a hydrated polymeric matrix. bacteria in biofilms are more resistant to the immune system and to antibiotics than their free-living planktonic counterparts. thus, biofilm-related infections are persistent and often show recurrent symptoms. the metal chelator edta is known to have activity against biofilms of gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus. edta can also kill planktonic cells of proteobacteria like pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this study we demonstrate that edta is a potent p. aeruginosa biofilm disrupter. in tris buffer, edta treatment of p. aeruginosa biofilms results in 1,000-fold greater killing than treatment with the p. aeruginosa antibiotic gentamicin. furthermore, a combination of edta and gentamicin results in complete killing of biofilm cells. p. aeruginosa biofilms can form structured mushroom-like entities when grown under flow on a glass surface. time lapse confocal scanning laser microscopy shows that edta causes a dispersal of p. aeruginosa cells from biofilms and killing of biofilm cells within the mushroom-like structures. an examination of the influence of several divalent cations on the antibiofilm activity of edta indicates that magnesium, calcium, and iron protect p. aeruginosa biofilms against edta treatment. our results are consistent with a mechanism whereby edta causes detachment and killing of biofilm cells.
significant reduction of nosocomial pneumonia after introduction of disinfection  of upper airways using povidone-iodine in geriatric wards.
we investigated the efficacy of disinfection of the upper airway using povidone-iodine against nosocomial pneumonia in geriatric wards. cases of nosocomial pneumonia were retrospectively analyzed between january 1991 and march 1995 in geriatric wards (190 beds). moreover, the relationship concerning methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolates between patient and environment was investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) with the smai restriction enzyme. the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia decreased significantly (p < 0.05). major causative organisms of nosocomial pneumonia were mrsa and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which significantly decreased. pfge studies showed that the patterns of mrsa isolates show a strong association between patient and environment. our study indicates that disinfection of the upper airways by povidone-iodine is very important in the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia in geriatric wards.
effect of low-level helium-neon laser therapy on the healing of third-degree burns in rats.
this paper presents the results of a study on the effects of low-level helium-neon laser therapy (ll he-ne lt) on the healing of burns. seventy-eight adult male rats, having been subjected to third-degree burns, were randomly divided into four groups: two laser treated groups (n=20, each), one control group (n=19) and one nitrofurazone treated group (n=19). in the two laser treated groups, the burns were treated on a daily basis with ll he-ne lt with an energy density of 1.2 and 2.4 j/cm(2), respectively. the response to treatment was assessed histologically at 7, 16 and 30 days after burning, and microbiologically at day 15. analysis of variance showed that the mean of blood vessel sections in the 1.2j/cm(2) laser group was significantly higher than those in the other groups and the mean of the depth of new epidermis in the 2.4 j/cm(2) laser group on day 16 was significantly lower than in the nitrofurazone treated group (p=0.025, p=0.047, respectively). when staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa grew in more than 50% of samples obtained from control group, there were no s. aureus and p. aeruginosa in the samples of 2.4 j/cm(2) laser group. it is concluded that ll he-ne lt induced the destruction of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa in third-degree burns of rats, yet at the same time our histological findings showed that ll he-ne lt caused a significant increase in the mean of blood vessel sections on day 7 after third degree burns and a decrease in the mean of the depth of new epidermis on day 16 after the same burns in rats.
n-acylhomoserine lactones antagonize virulence gene expression and quorum sensing in staphylococcus aureus.
many gram-negative bacteria employ n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl)-mediated quorum sensing to control virulence. to determine whether gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus respond to ahls, we used a growth-dependent lux reporter fusion. exposure of s. aureus to different ahls revealed that 3-oxo-substituted ahls with c10 to c14 acyl chains inhibited light output and growth in a concentration-dependent manner, while short-chain ahls had no effect. n-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-c12-hsl) inhibited the production of exotoxins and cell wall fibronectin-binding proteins but enhanced protein a expression. since these processes are reciprocally regulated via the s. aureus agr quorum-sensing system, which in turn, is regulated via sar, we examined the effect of ahls on sara and agr. at sub-growth-inhibitory concentrations of 3-oxo-c12-hsl, both sara expression and agr expression were inhibited, indicating that the action of 3-oxo-c12-hsl is mediated at least in part through antagonism of quorum sensing in s. aureus. spent culture supernatants from pseudomonas aeruginosa, which produces both 3-oxo-c12-hsl and n-butanoyl-homoserine lactone (c4-hsl), also inhibited agr expression, although c4-hsl itself was inactive in this assay. since quorum sensing in s. aureus depends on the activities of membrane-associated proteins, such as agrb, agrc, and agrd, we investigated whether ahls perturbed s. aureus membrane functionality by determining their influence on the membrane dipole potential. from the binding curves obtained, a dissociation constant of 7 mum was obtained for 3-oxo-c12-hsl, indicating the presence of a specific saturable receptor, whereas no binding was observed for c4-hsl. these data demonstrate that long-chain 3-oxo-substituted ahls, such as 3-oxo-c12-hsl, are capable of interacting with the s. aureus cytoplasmic membrane in a saturable, specific manner and at sub-growth-inhibitory concentrations, down-regulating exotoxin production and both sara and agr expression.
the crisis of resistance: identifying drug exposures to suppress amplification of resistant mutant subpopulations.
antibiotic resistance is seen in both the hospital and community settings. approaches are required to minimize the increase in resistant strains, such as good antibiotic stewardship and the limiting of antibiotic use to appropriate circumstances. there are instances when drug dose and/or schedule can be used to minimize the probability that mutants will take over the bacterial population. over the past several years, significant advances have been made in understanding the relationship between drug concentrations and amplification of resistant mutant subpopulations. in this review, we examine the use of preclinical models for facilitating this understanding. we also use mathematical techniques, including monte carlo simulation, to bridge between the identification of exposures to minimize resistance and the examination of candidate drug doses to achieve this end. examples are provided for pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. in each instance, quinolone antimicrobials were examined. more investigations with other pathogens and drug classes are required.
phytochemical and antimicrobial studies of salvia splendens sello.
the phytochemical investigation of antimicrobial agents from locally occurring salvia splendens sello, was carried out. three common solvents i.e. petroleum ether (40-60%), chloroform and methanol were successively used for the extraction of antimicrobial principles from its various parts. three major compounds (namely c1, c2, and c3) were isolated and purified from the active methanol extract of roots by column and thin layer chromatography. gram-positive bacteria (bacillus pumilus, b. subtilis and staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative bacteria (proteus vulgaris, escherichia coil and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a fungus (candida albicans) were used to measure the zones of inhibition of these compounds by known method. one of the compound c1 gave larger zones than the other two isolated compounds (c2 and c3). an attempt was made to identify the nature of antimicrobial compounds by available spectral means. a possible structure-activity relationship of the potent antimicrobial compounds was discussed.
antibacterial screening of citrullus colocynthis.
crude ethanolic extracts of fruits, leaves, stems and roots of citrullus colocynthis schrad were examined for their antibacterial potentialities against gram positive and gram negative bacilli. ethanolic extracts of fruits, leaves, stems and roots were found to be active against gram positive bacilli, viz., bacillus pumilus and staphylococcus aureus, while fruit and root extracts in double strength gave positive results against gram positive bacillus (bacillus subtilis). the gram negative bacilli viz., escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed no response.
studies on antimicrobial activity, in vitro, of physalis angulata l. (solanaceae) fraction and physalin b bringing out the importance of assay determination.
complex physalin metabolites present in the capsules of the fruit of physalis angulata l. have been isolated and submitted to a series of assays of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, s. aureus atcc 25923, s. aureus atcc 6538p, neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 49226, escherichia coli atcc 8739; e. coli atcc 25922, candida albicans atcc 10231 applying different methodologies such as: bioautography, dilution broth, dilution agar, and agar diffusion techniques. a mixture of physalins (pool) containing physalins b, d, f, g inhibit s. aureus atcc 29213, s. aureus atcc 25923, s. aureus atcc 6538p, and n. gonorrhoeae atcc 49226 at a concentration of 200 mg/microl, using agar dilution assays. the mixture was inactive against p. aeruginosa atcc27853, e. coli atcc 8739; e. coli atcc 25922, c. albicans atcc 10231 when applying bioautography assays. physalin b (200 microg/ml) by the agar diffusion assay inhibited s. aureus atcc 6538p by +/- 85%; and may be considered responsible for the antimicrobial activity.
synthesis and biological evaluation of novel benzimidazol/benzoxazolylethoxypiperidone oximes.
some novel benzimidazol/benzoxazolylethoxypiperidone oximes were synthesized and  their antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus (ncim-2492), bacillus subtilis (ncim-2439), escherichia coli (ncim-2345) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (ncim-2035) and antifungal activity against candida albicans (ncim-c27), candida-6 (ncim-c27), candida-51 (ncim-c27), aspergillus niger (ncim-590) and aspergillus flavus (ncim-539) have been evaluated. compounds 26 and 27 exerted potent in vitro antibacterial activity against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus while compounds 26, 29 and 30 exhibited potent in vitro antifungal activity against candida albicans, candida-51, and aspergillus niger.
the receptor-binding region of human apolipoprotein e has direct anti-infective activity.
background: the apoe genotype has a uniquely strong influence on the outcome of viral infection. the mechanism is unknown, although one possibility is direct inhibition of viral entry into cells. methods: we have examined the direct anti-infective activity of a peptide analogue of the receptor-binding region of apolipoprotein e (apoe) that is known as "apoe dimer tandem repeat peptide" (apoedp) and has previously been shown to mimic some of the biological effects of apoe and that recently was shown to bind low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. results: apoedp has activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, human immunodeficiency virus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus; concentrations in the range of 1-20 micromol/l inhibit infection by 50%. these biological actions depend on adoption of an alpha -helical structure, as has been found for other biological effects of apoe peptides. the peptide interferes with the earliest stages of viral infection, preventing viral attachment and exerting a mild virucidal action. in addition, an n-terminal fragment of apoe that also contains this binding domain has antiviral activity. conclusions: these data suggest that human apoe or fragments containing the receptor-binding domain may contribute to innate immunity to viral infection by direct disruption of viral particles and/or inhibition of viral attachment, thus reducing viral entry.
evaluation of the antimicrobial properties of different parts of citrus aurantifolia (lime fruit) as used locally.
we investigated the potency of citrus aurantifolia (lime fruit), against pathogens, in the different forms in which this fruit plant is used locally (juice of the fruit, burnt rind of the fruit commonly known as "epa-ijebu" in the yoruba dialect) and the oil obtained from steam distillation of the fruit. the antimicrobial activity of "epa-ijebu" in different solvents was also compared. the solvents include palm-wine (a local alcoholic drink tapped from palm trees), seaman's schnapps 40% alcoholic drink, water, ethanol and fermented water from 3 days soaked milled maize known as "ekan-ogi" or "omidun" in the yoruba dialect. antimicrobial activity was carried out by the agar well diffusion. the clinical isolates used included anaerobic facultative bacteria, namely: staphylococcus aureus atcc 25213, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella paratyphi, shigella flexnerii, streptococcus faecalis, citrobacter spp, serratia spp, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and escherichia coli; fungi such as aspergillus niger and candida albicans; and anaerobes which includes bacteroides spp, porphyromonas spp, and clostridium spp. crude extracts of all solvents used varied in zones of inhibition. the anaerobes and the gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to all the extracts with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 32 mg/ml-128 g/ml. the activity against the fungi showed only the oil extract potent for a. niger, while candida albicans was susceptible to all the extracts with mic ranging from 256 mg/ml-512 mg/ml. the gram-negatives have mic ranging from 64 mg/ml-512 mg/ml. minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranged between 32 mg/ml to 512 mg/ml depending on isolates and extracting solvent. the oil and palm-wine extract of "epa-ijebu" showed greater activity than the other extracts. the killing rate of the schnapps extract on s. aureus and e. coli was 1 and 3.5 hours respectively.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of some nigerian medicinal plants.
ten nigerian plants suggested from their ethnomedical uses to possess antimicrobial and antioxidant activities were studied for their anti-microbial and anti-oxidant properties. antimicrobial activity was tested against escherichia coli nctc 10418, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, candida pseudotropicalis and trichophyton rubrum (clinical isolate). trichilia heudelotti leaf extract showed both antibacterial and antifungal activities and was the most active against all the strains of bacteria tested. boerhavia diffusa, markhamia tomentosa and t. heudelotti leaf extracts inhibited the gram negative bacteria e. coli and p. aeruginosa strains whereas those of m. tomentosa, t. heudelotti and sphenoceutrum jollyamum root inhibited at least one of the fungi tested. at a concentration of 312 microg/ml, hexane and chloroform fractions of t. heudelotti extract inhibited 6 and 14% of the fifty multi-drug resistant bacteria isolates from clinical infections, respectively. at < or = 5 mg/ml, the chcl(3) (64%) and aqueous (22%) fractions of t. heudelotti and those of chcl(3) (34%) and etoac (48%) of m. tomentosa gave the highest inhibition that was stronger than their corresponding methanol extracts. the corresponding ec(50) of the extracts on m. acuminata, t. heudelotti, e. senegalensis and m. tomentosa were 4.00, 6.50, 13.33, and 16.50 ig/ml using the tlc staining and 1,1-dipheyl-2-picry-hydrazyl (dpph) free radical scavenging assay. therefore, leaf extracts of m. tomentosa and t. heudelotti, especially the latter, possess strong antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and should be further investigated. these activities justified the ethnomedical uses of these plants.
synthesis and in vitro microbiological evaluation of imidazo(4,5-b)pyridinylethoxypiperidones.
a series of imidazo(4,5-b)pyridinylethoxypiperidones was designed, synthesized and characterized for evaluation of potential antibacterial activity against bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against candida albicans-6, candida albicans, aspergillus niger, candida albicans-51 and aspergillus flavus. structure-activity relationship led to the conclusion that compound 39 exerted strong in vitro antibacterial activity against bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus whereas compounds 38 and 39 displayed promising antifungal activity against aspergillus flavus. the interesting antimicrobial profile of compound 39 led us to select this derivative for further development.
trends in antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens and effect on treatment.
antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens is a growing concern for health care and for public health. a recent shift in the epidemiological profile of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus has resulted not only in health care-associated infections but now, also, in community-associated infections. reports have described s. aureus exhibiting decreased susceptibility and, even, resistance to vancomycin. the rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci may be leveling; however, vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium has already achieved high levels. multidrug resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa is increasing, and carbapenem-resistant klebsiella strains are emerging. acinetobacter species cause a minority of health care-associated pneumonias due to gram-negative organisms, but a growing proportion is resistant to carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins. recent increases in the frequency and severity of clostridium difficile-associated illness are associated with the emergence of a hypervirulent c. difficile strain with increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones. the presence of these and other resistant organisms in health care facilities limits the number of effective antimicrobials available for treatment.
triaminotriazine dna helicase inhibitors with antibacterial activity.
screening of a chemical library in a dna helicase assay involving the pseudomonas aeruginosa dnab helicase provided a triaminotriazine inhibitor with good antibacterial activity but associated cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. synthesis of analogs provided a few inhibitors that retained antibacterial activity and demonstrated a significant reduction in cytotoxicity. the impact of serum and initial investigations toward a mode of action highlight several features of this class of compounds as antibacterials.
antimicrobial activity on glass materials subject to disinfectant xerogel coating.
the antimicrobial compound dodecyl-di(aminoethyl)-glycine was immobilized in a silicon oxide xerogel matrix and used for glass surface coating. coated glasses were tested for surface antimicrobial activity. the utilization of tetraethoxysilane (teos) as a silicon oxide polymer precursor, using the dip-coating process, allowed for the generation of transparent thin films over glass surfaces. different concentrations of the antimicrobial compound were used to generate the coatings. the presence of dodecyl-di(aminoethyl)-glycine on coated and uncoated slides was analyzed by ft-ir spectra. coated glass slides were exposed to suspensions of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus for 24 h. surface contamination was evaluated by the microbial plate count technique. when antimicrobial-coated glasses were compared with antimicrobial-free coated glasses, the former showed greater than 99% reduction of colony-forming units (cfu) for e. coli and p. aeruginosa, when 1% of antimicrobial was present in the coating solution. the same percentage of reduction for s. aureus was achieved when 1.5% of the antimicrobial was present in the coating solution. in a direct inhibition test on agar plates, no inhibitory zone was observed, indicating that the antimicrobial did not diffuse into the media.
[evaluation of the antimicrobial action of honey against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, listeria monocytogenes and aspergillus niger. evaluation of its microbiological charge].
the evaluation of the microbiological charge present in costa rican samples as the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity over different microorganisms, including those associated to wound infections, will allow to emit criteria referred to its use in therapeutic treatments, specially as alternative therapy for cases involving antibiotic resistant bacteria. the microbiological charge of 25 honey samples, acquired in costa rican markets was evaluated through several indicators including total plate aerobic count, total plate anaerobic count, total aerobic spore count, total anaerobic spore count and molds and yeast count. also, samples were inoculated in tubes with chopped meat media and plated in egg yolk agar in order to determine the presence of clostridium botulinum. for the antimicrobial activity evaluation, the diffusion method in muller hinton agar was performed, testing different honey concentrations (100, 75, 50, 25, 12,5 and 6,25 % v/v) against staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), staphylococcus epidermidis (ucr 2902), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 9027), escherichia coli (atcc25922), salmonella enteritidis (atcc 13076), listeria monocytogenes (atcc 19116) and aspergillus niger. the results obtained for the microbiological characterization of honey show that 91% of samples had counts equal or lower than 1,0 x 10(1) cfu/g. no positive result was obtained for the isolation of c. botulinum. 24 of the samples analyzed inhibited the growth of s. aureus even in a 25% v/v concentration, nevertheless, a. niger was no inhibited by any of the samples tested.
in vitro efficacy of the successive or staggered use of eardrops.
chronic suppurative otitis media is still a significant health problem. several topical agents such as antibacterials, steroids and acid media eardrops are widely used alone or in combination to control active otorrhea and obtain a dry ear. patients frequently ask if there is any benefit or loss in the effect of these due to their use in a successive or staggered manner. this question led us to design this in vitro study to investigate the effect of the acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate on the antimicrobial effects of some ototopical antibiotics during their successive or staggered usage. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli were used for testing the antimicrobial activities of the selected antibiotic drops. six microliters of acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were used alone or together with 6 microl each of ciprofloxacin hcl, tobramycin and ofloxacin solution. drops were placed on whatman no. 1 paper disks with a diameter of 6 mm, and the disks were placed onto mueller-hinton agar plates on which bacteria had been swabbed over the entire surface. after overnight incubation of the plates at 35 degrees c, the diameters of the inhibition zones were recorded. there was no antibacterial effect in response to either acid solution or dexamethasone used alone. the inhibition zones of the antibiotics did not change with either steroid or acid media solution added onto the antibiotic disks alone or together. acid solution or steroids should be preferred to use in combination with antibacterial otic drugs in in-vivo settings; no negative or positive effects were seen in in-vitro conditions. therefore, prescribed eardrops can be used in a successive or staggered manner without any influence on the treatment results.
antimicrobial activity of doripenem (s-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
the spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; mic90s 0.06 mg/l), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of enterococcus faecium, doripenem displayed modest activity (mic50 4). doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; mic(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). for enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (mic90s 0.03-0.5 mg/l). mic90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155 isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. doripenem was also active against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. (mic90s 0.06-0.25 mg/l), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/l, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/l, respectively). doripenem was slightly more potent (mic50 2 mg/l) than ertapenem and imipenem (mic50 4 mg/l), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (mic50 2 mg/l), against burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). both haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and moraxella catarrhalis (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (mic90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.
an in vitro evaluation of antibiotic combinations for urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes mellitus.
this prospective in-vitro study evaluates the synergistic potential of various antibiotic combinations against resistant pathogens isolated from urinary tract infections (utis) in patients with diabetes mellitus. antibiotic combinations using the microtiter checkerboard method showed that overall, synergy could be seen in 41.86%-67.44% cases amongst the five different antibiotic combinations studied against the four predominant resistant pathogens namely escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella ozaenae. the checkerboard synergy studies showed that 69.23% of the s. aureus strains tested were synergistically inhibited by the combination of ofloxacin + cefotaxime [of+cf], 83.33% of the e. coli strains and 75% of the k. ozaenae strains were synergistically inhibited by the combination of amikacin + cefotaxime [ak+cf], while 58.33% of the p. aeruginosa strains were synergistically inhibited by the combination of amikacin + piperacillin [ak+pp].
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of n-alkyl and n-aryl piperazine derivatives.
a series of substituted piperazine derivatives have been synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity. the antibacterial activity was tested against staphylococcus aureus (mtccb 737), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mtccb 741), streptomyces epidermidis (mtccb 1824) and escherichia coli (mtccb 1652), and antifungal activity against aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus flavus and aspergillus niger. all synthesized compounds showed significant activity against bacterial strains but were found to be less active against tested fungi. in vitro toxicity tests demonstrated that compounds 4d and 6a showed very less toxicity against human erythrocytes.
spectrum of clear corneal incision cataract wound infection.
purpose: to describe the presentation, management, and outcome of 5 patients who  presented with main-port or side-port wound infection after uneventful clear corneal cataract surgery. setting: ophthalmic surgery centre, chatswood, and department of ophthalmology, prince of wales hospital, randwick, australia, and moorfields eye hospital nhs foundation trust, london, united kingdom. methods: this retrospective case series comprised 5 patients who had uneventful clear corneal phacoemulsification surgery and developed either a main-port or side-port wound infection. the clinical features, microbiologic studies, management, and results are reported. results: the median age of the patients was 79 years. infection of the main-port incision occurred in 3 cases and of the side port in 2 cases. the patients presented from a few days to several weeks after uneventful phacoemulsification. in 2 cases, the bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus were isolated. in 1 case, the fungus aspergillus was isolated and required extensive medical and surgical treatment. in the other 2 cases; empiric antimicrobial therapy was given because no organism was isolated in 1 case, and in the other milder case, microbiological investigations were not performed. final visual acuity was 6/4 in 2 cases and 6/5, 6/12, and 6/18 in 1 case each. conclusions: bacterial or fungal wound infection can present within days or even several weeks following clear corneal cataract surgery. patients with ocular discomfort or blurred vision after such surgery should be advised to report promptly. rapid identification and appropriate management of patients with clear corneal wound infection can result in good visual outcomes.
toll-like receptor 2-mediated expression of beta-defensin-2 in human corneal epithelial cells.
we previously showed that human corneal epithelial cells (hcecs) express toll-like receptors (tlrs), which recognize gram-positive bacteria and respond to staphylococcus aureus infection by the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and beta-defensin-2 (hbd2). in this study, we further elucidated the underlying mechanisms regulating hbd-2 expression and its role in innate defense in hcecs in response to s. aureus challenge. exposure of hucl cells, a telomerase-immortalized hcec line, to s. aureus, its exoproducts (1:10 dilution), or synthetic lipopeptide pam3cys (10 microg/ml) resulted in the up-regulation of hbd-2, but not hbd1 and hbd3. similar to hucl cells, primary hcecs responded to s. aureus-exoproducts and pam3cys challenge by expressing hbd2 mrna and secreting hbd2 into the culture media. furthermore, these stimuli induced the expression of tlr2 at both mrna and protein levels. consistently with its role as a major pattern-recognizing receptor, tlr2 was located at the cell surface by cell surface biotinylation. the treatment of hucl cells with tlr2 neutralizing antibody resulted in a significant decrease in pam3cys-induced hbd2 production as well as il-6, il-8, and tnf-alpha secretion. the pam3cys-induced hbd2 expression was completely blocked by nf-kappab inhibitors and partially inhibited by p38 map kinase and the jnk inhibitors. conditioned media derived from hcecs challenged with s. aureus-exoproducts or pam3cys exhibited antibacterial activity against s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. these findings suggest that s. aureus induces hbd2 production through tlr2-mediated pathways in hcecs and that pathogen-challenged, tlr-activated hcecs possess antimicrobial activity. thus, the epithelium might play a role in innate defense against bacterial infection by directly killing bacteria in the cornea.
combined effects of panipenem and aminoglycosides on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro.
background: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa are the main causes of refractory infections that are often resistant to antimicrobial agents. in these cases, combination of agents with antimicrobial activity is being examined. however, few studies have investigated combined effects with antimicrobial agents including carbapenem and aminoglycosides. methods: we evaluated the effects of panipenem (papm) combined with 3 aminoglycosides, arbekacin, amikacin, and netilmicin, and vancomicin (vcm) with an agar dilution checkerboard technique and the fractional inhibitory concentration index against 47 strains of mrsa and 56 strains of p. aeruginosa. results: papm combined with vcm achieved a synergic effect against mrsa in 80.9%. papm combined with aminoglycosides showed only additive effects against mrsa and p. aeruginosa. when comparing the activity of mueller-hinton agar (mha) medium with mha medium diluted 40-fold (1/40 mha) against p. aeruginosa, the mean minimum inhibitory concentration of papm was decreased to 1/16. conclusions: combination of papm and vcm is effective against mrsa. combinations of papm and aminoglycosides showed additive effects against mrsa and p. aeruginosa.
in-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
a series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
antibacterial effect of bulbophyllum neilgherrense wt. (orchidaceae). an in vitro study.
the antibacterial activity of bulbophyllum neilgherrense was tested against five  species of bacteria, viz., escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus pumilus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida aqueous, ethanolic and chloroform soluble extracts of leaf and pseudobulb (5.50 w/v) were screened for their antibacterial potential. the zone of inhibition was seen to be largest when alcoholic extract was used.
toxicological effect of indole and its azo dye derivatives on some microorganisms under aerobic conditions.
azo dyes are ubiquitous commercial chemicals that present unique environmental problems. the azo dyes in particular can undergo natural anaerobic degradation to potentially carcinogenic amines. they pose a major problem for water-treatment plants downstream. one strategy to remidate polluted surface contaminants is to make use of the degradative capacity of bacteria rather than using destructive chemical reactions. therefore, pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms namely; bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae have been chosen and the toxicological effect of indole and its azo dye methyl derivatives on these microorganisms was studied under aerobic conditions. while these compounds have showed remarkable activity against b. megaterium, b. subtilis, b. thuringiensis and s. aureus, they did not exhibit any activity against p. vulgaris. however, indole acted as an inhibitor on all of these compounds specially the gram negative bacterium p. aeruginosa.
bacterial flora of leg ulcers in patients admitted to department of dermatology,  poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period.
venous leg ulcers are an important cause of morbidity in a significant percentage of the world population. the percentage of leg ulceration, either active or healed, in the european population is about 1%-2%. the aim of this study was to analyze the rate of colonization and qualitative composition of the bacterial flora isolated from leg ulcers in patients admitted to dermatology department, poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period, with special reference to the infection risk factors. bacteriological diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. in 173 positive results, the predominant culture composition included staphylococcus aureus (56.57%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (37.14%), enterococcus faecalis (22.29%), proteus mirabilis (13.71%) and escherichia coli (12.57%). there was a significant increase in the incidence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli, along with a decrease in the incidence of staphylococcus aureus isolation during the study period. the rate of yeast-like fungi strains, mainly candida albicans, recorded in culture composition showed a systematic increase. changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of bacterial flora, presence of multiple isolates, and concomitant diseases that may influence the characteristics of leg ulcer disease were closely monitored.
evaluation of a clinical pathway for ventilator-associated pneumonia: changes in  bacterial flora and the adequacy of empiric antibiotics over a three-year period.
background: evaluation of causative pathogens is vital for optimizing empiric antibiotic therapy of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). based on previous data (ann surg 1998;227:743-755), empiric antibiotics for our vap clinical pathway were modified to target early and late occurring pathogens (ampicillin/sulbactam during the first week of hospitalization; cefepime plus vancomycin afterwards). the objectives of this study were to compare organisms causing vap over a three-year period to previous data, and to determine the adequacy of the empiric antibiotic regimens. methods: a total of 299 critically ill trauma patients with vap over a three-year period were studied retrospectively. the incidence of pathogens causing vap in the study period were compared to a previously published study of a two-year period in our intensive care unit (icu). sensitivities of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were evaluated over the study period. the adequacy of empiric antibiotic therapy for each episode of vap was determined. therapy was considered to be adequate if one or more antibiotics had in vitro activity against the organism causing vap. results: statistically significant changes in pathogens included increased staphylococcus aureus (incidence 17% vs. 11%, p = 0.024) and decreased acinetobacter baumannii (11% vs. 22%, p < 0.001). susceptibility patterns were statistically unchanged except for increased resistance of p. aeruginosa to extended-spectrum penicillins (p = 0.016). empiric therapy was adequate in 76% of vap episodes. conclusions: the clinical pathway's empiric antibiotic regimen was associated with only modest changes in organisms causing vap and provided a high rate of adequate empiric coverage.
plasma concentrations might lead to overestimation of target site activity of piperacillin in patients with sepsis.
objectives: pharmacokinetic (pk)/pharmacodynamic (pd) models have become increasingly important in optimizing antimicrobial therapy. this approach is highly recommended by regulatory authorities intending to force the evaluation of antimicrobial action at the site of infection. methods: clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus with mics of 4, 8 and 16 mg/l for piperacillin were used in an in vivo pk/in vitro pd model. bacteria were exposed in vitro to the concentration-versus-time profiles of piperacillin in plasma and subcutaneous adipose tissue measured in vivo in septic patients. samples were withdrawn at defined intervals and the numbers of bacteria per ml were counted and plotted against time. results: piperacillin levels determined in plasma were able to effectively inhibit bacterial growth of all bacterial strains used in the present study (mic ranged from 4-16 mg/l). in contrast, concentration-versus-time profiles of subcutaneous adipose tissue were effective in killing isolates with mics of 4 and 8 mg/l only, while bacterial growth of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa with mics of 16 mg/l was not inhibited. conclusions: bacteria with mics < 16 mg/l were effectively inhibited in subcutaneous adipose tissue in patients with sepsis. the prediction of microbiological outcome based on concentrations of piperacillin in plasma resulted in a marked overestimation of antimicrobial activity at the site of infection.
brazilian phytopharmaceuticals--evaluation against hospital bacteria.
pharmaceutical companies have demonstrated renewed interest in investigating higher plants as sources for new lead structures and also for the development of standardized phytotherapeutic agents of proven efficacy, safety and quality. this work analysed three commercial phytopharmaceuticals against multi-resistant bacteria of medical importance, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates from the brazilian endemic clone. from the phytopharmaceuticals assayed, plants from the products 'astmoflora' and 'kokolos' were considered active, while plants from 'uva do mato' were not active in the tested concentrations, which ranged from 62.5 to 500 microg/ml. among fractions of aristolochia cymbifera and myroxylon balsamum, the hexane extracts showed the best results against staphylococcus spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. these fractions showed growth inhibition of all methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus strains and the majority of the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains at a concentration of 500 microg/ml. bioassay-guided fractionation of hexane extracts of aristolochia cymbifera and myroxylon balsamum led to the identification of the diterpene 2-oxo-populifolic acid and of the chalcone isoliquiritigenin, respectively, as antimicrobial compounds.
rationale for using peltophorum africanum (fabaceae) extracts in veterinary medicine.
peltophorum africanum (fabaceae) is a deciduous tree widespread in southern africa. the plant has many ethnomedical and ethnoveterinary uses. root and bark decoctions are used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, sore throat, wounds, back and joint pains, hiv-aids, venereal diseases and infertility. pastoralists and rural farmers use the root and bark extracts to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, infertility, and to promote well-being and resistance to diseases in cattle. to evaluate these ethnobotanical leads, dried leaves, stem bark and root bark were extracted with ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane and hexane. polyphenols in the extract were determined by the folin-ciocalteu method with gallic acid as standard. qualitative antioxidant activity was screened by spraying thin layer chromatograms (tlc) of the extracts with 0.2% 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (dpph), and quantified with trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac) assay. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and total antibacterial activity (taa) were determined by serial microplate dilution for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, with gentamicin as standard and tetrazolium violet as growth indicator. acetone and ethanol extracted the largest quantity of material. polyphenols concentration was 49.2% in acetone extract of the root and 3.8% in dichloromethane extract of the leaf. antioxidant activity of at least 5 antioxidant compounds as measured by teac ranged from 1.34 (ethanol extract of the root) to 0.01 (hexane extract of the leaf). the total antibacterial activity (volume to which active compounds present in 1 g plant material can be diluted and still inhibit bacterial growth) was 1263 ml/g for ethanol extract of the root against s. aureus, and 800 ml/g for acetone extract of the root against p. aeruginosa. there was substantial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with mic values of 0.08 mg/ml for s. aureus and 0.16 mg/ml for p. aeruginosa. there is therefore a rationale for the traditional use of root and bark of p. africanum in treating bacterial infection related diseases.
potency and spectrum trends for cefepime tested against 65746 clinical bacterial  isolates collected in north american medical centers: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998-2003).
we evaluated the antimicrobial spectrum and potency of cefepime and selected comparators agents against clinical bacterial strains collected in north america over a 6-year period (1998-2003). isolates were consecutively collected from bloodstream (44%), respiratory tract (41%), urinary tract (6%), and skin/soft tissue (5%) infections in 48 medical centers. isolates were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods in a central laboratory. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci were excluded from the analysis. imipenem (mic90 = 1 microg/ml, 99.9% susceptible) was the most active compound tested against enterobacteriaceae (22860 isolates tested) followed by cefepime (mic90 = 0.25 microg/ml, 99.5% susceptible) > amikacin (99.4% susceptible) > ceftriaxone (95.6% susceptible) > aztreonam (95.1% susceptible). among comparators, the lowest susceptibility rate for enterobacteriaceae was observed with ciprofloxacin (92.8% susceptible). imipenem was also the most active compound against esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli (99.3% and 100% susceptible, respectively), followed by amikacin (81.4% and 97.2% susceptible, respectively) and cefepime (92.5% and 93.8% susceptible, respectively). cefepime activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (85.2% susceptible) was similar to that of imipenem (86.9% susceptible). against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, cefepime (mic90 = 4 microg/ml, 100.0% susceptible) was 4-fold more active than ceftazidime (mic90 = 16 microg/ml, 86.4% susceptible) and showed a higher susceptibility rate than ciprofloxacin (93.2% susceptible). cefepime was the most active compound tested against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 1 microg/ml, 97.4% susceptible), ranked after gatifloxacin and levofloxacin (99.2% susceptible). the activity of cefepime remained stable during the study period evaluated with the susceptibility rates varying from 99.3% to 99.8% among the enterobacteriaceae and 84.4% to 88.4% among p. aeruginosa isolates. in summary, cefepime has retained broad activity and spectrum against enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and gram-positive cocci (except oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci) isolated from north american medical centers in the 1998-2003 period. continued resistance surveillance is critical to monitor the effectiveness of widely used parenteral antimicrobial agents such as cefepime.
in vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program, 2004).
tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. to determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) commenced in 2003. this study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. tigecycline was the most active agent tested against gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. mic90 results (microg/ml) for tigecycline against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. tigecycline was active against enterobacteriaceae with an mic90 of 1 microg/ml. haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an mic90 of only 0.25 microg/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
antimicrobial activity of tigecycline tested against nosocomial bacterial pathogens from patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit.
the antimicrobial activity of tigecycline and selected antimicrobials was evaluated against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) worldwide. a total of 9093 isolates were consecutively collected in >70 medical centers in north america (4157), south america (1830), europe (3034), and the asia-australia (72) areas. the isolates were collected from the bloodstream (68.5%), respiratory tract (13.6%), skin/soft tissue (5.5%), and urinary tract (2.0%) infections in the 2000-2004 period, and susceptibility was tested by reference broth microdilution methods. the most frequently isolated pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (32.1%), enterococcus spp. (13.7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 13.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.4%), and escherichia coli (7.9%). all gram-positive pathogens (5665) were inhibited at < or =1 microg/ml of tigecycline. resistance to oxacillin was detected in 43.5% of staphylococcus aureus and in 85.0% of cons, and resistance to vancomycin was observed in 18.6% of enterococci. tigecycline was very active against enterobacteriaceae (1876 strains tested) with an mic90 of < or =1 microg/ml, except for serratia spp. (2 microg/ml). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype was detected in 10% of e. coli and 31% of klebsiella spp., whereas 28% of enterobacter spp. were resistant to ceftazidime (ampc enzyme production). these resistance phenotypes did not adversely affect tigecycline activity. tigecycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were the most active compounds against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 2 and 1 microg/ml respectively). tigecycline was also active against acinetobacter spp. (mic90, 1 microg/ml), but p. aeruginosa showed decreased susceptibility to tigecycline (mic90, 16 microg/ml). in summary, isolates from icu patients worldwide showed high rates of antimicrobial resistance. the most alarming problems detected were vancomycin resistance among enterococci, esbl-mediated beta-lactam resistance and fluoroquinolone resistance among enterobacteriaceae, and carbapenem resistance among p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro activity against most of clinically important pathogenic bacteria (except p. aeruginosa) isolated from icu patients and may represent an excellent option for the treatment of infections in this clinical environment.
potency and spectrum of tigecycline tested against an international collection of bacterial pathogens associated with skin and soft tissue infections (2000-2004).
the antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, was evaluated against 5289 bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with skin and soft tissue infections during 2000-2004. strains were submitted from >70 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe, and were tested centrally using reference broth microdilution methods. the top 10 ranking pathogens (95% of total) recovered included staphylococcus aureus (55.2%), enterococcus spp. (9.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%), escherichia coli (5.6%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (5.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.9%), enterobacter spp. (2.8%), klebsiella spp. (2.6%), proteus mirabilis (1.7%), and indole-positive proteae (1.2%). all staphylococci (s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci), enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and e. coli were inhibited by < or =2 microg/ml of tigecycline; in addition, 97% of klebsiella spp., 95% of enterobacter spp., and 97% of acinetobacter spp. were inhibited at this concentration. only p. aeruginosa and all proteae (mic90, 16 microg/ml) displayed elevated mic values to tigecycline. the broad spectrum of activity exhibited by this glycylcycline included tetracycline-resistant organism subsets, as well as oxacillin-resistant s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enteric bacilli strains. tigecycline represents a new choice among broad-spectrum parenteral agents for the common gram-positive and -negative pathogens producing serious infections of skin and soft tissues.
antimicrobial activity of tigecycline tested against organisms causing community-acquired respiratory tract infection and nosocomial pneumonia.
emerging antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has created a critical need for development of new antimicrobial agents that are not affected by the commonly occurring genetic resistance mechanisms. tigecycline, a novel broad-spectrum parenteral glycylcycline, has been shown to be active against many of gram-positive, gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic organisms, including strains highly resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobials and was recently approved by the us food and drug administration for treating infections of skin and skin structures, and for intra-abdominal infections. in this study, tigecycline spectrum and potency were evaluated against a global collection of pathogens (2000-2004) recovered from community-acquired respiratory infections (7580 strains) or from hospitalized patients with pneumonia (3183 strains). among community-acquired infections, the ranking pathogens were haemophilus influenzae (52.9%; 21% ampicillin-resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%; 23.7% penicillin-nonsusceptible), and moraxella catarrhalis (7.9%). tigecycline displayed potent activity by inhibiting 100% of the 3 species at clinically achievable concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). the 10 most prevalent pathogens producing 94.3% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients were staphylococcus aureus (48.5% of strains; 49.4% oxacillin-resistant), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), klebsiella spp. (5.6%), s. pneumoniae (4.6%), acinetobacter spp. (4.5%), enterobacter spp. (4.0%), escherichia coli (3.8%), serratia marcescens (2.5%), enterococcus spp. (2.3%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (1.1%). at a concentration of 4 microg/ml, tigecycline inhibited >96% of these pathogens (exception, p. aeruginosa). s. aureus was readily inhibited by tigecycline (mic50 and mic90, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively) with all strains inhibited at < or =1 microg/ml. streptococci recovered from hospitalized patients (beta-hemolytic and s. pneumoniae) were also very susceptible to tigecycline with the highest mic being 0.12 microg/ml. all e. coli (including 13.3% with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl] phenotype) were inhibited by < or =1 microg/ml, and all klebsiella (25.8% esbl phenotype) and enterobacter spp. plus 97.0% of serratia spp. were inhibited by < or =4 microg/ml. tigecycline was also active against acinetobacter spp. and s. maltophilia strains (mic50 and mic90, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively). further clinical studies should consider the role that tigecycline may play in the therapy for severe respiratory tract infections, both of nosocomial and community origin.
tigecycline activity tested against 26,474 bloodstream infection isolates: a collection from 6 continents.
the activity of tigecycline (formerly gar936), a novel glycylcycline, was tested  against recent bloodstream infection (bsi) pathogen isolates from 6 continents. frequency of clinical occurrence of these pathogens was determined and their antibiograms assessed using reference broth microdilution methods. a total of 26474 strains were tested for tigecycline susceptibility according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) by the m7-a6 guidelines with interpretations from m100-s15 and the package insert. the rank order of pathogens was staphylococcus aureus (33.1%), escherichia coli (14.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13.5%), enterococcus spp. (12.3%), klebsiella spp. (5.7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.2%), enterobacter spp. (3.0%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (2.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae (2.3%), and viridans group streptococci (1.4%). tigecycline exhibited a broader spectrum of activity against bsi isolates when compared to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, and many beta-lactams (imipenem). tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens tested, including staphylococci (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml), enterococci (mic90, 0.25 microg/ml), streptococci (mic(90), < or =0.12 microg/ml), escherichia coli (mic90, 0.25 microg/ml), klebsiella spp. (mic90, 1 mmicrog/ml), and enterobacter spp. (mic(90), 2 mmicrog/ml), but showed limited inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 16 microg/ml) and indole-positive or indole-negative proteae (mic90, 4-8 microg/ml). in summary, tigecycline exhibited a wide spectrum of antimicrobial potency versus bsi isolates collected worldwide. serious infections in nosocomial environments should benefit from tigecycline use among the investigational phase 3 agents focused toward resistant strains.
solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.
the antimicrobial activity of essential oils (eos) of cinnamon (cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (syzygium aromaticum), basil (ocimum basillicum), rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis), dill (anethum graveolens), and ginger (zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). the eos were tested against an array of four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes), four gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella choleraesuis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, candida albicans, and two molds, penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus). the rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. in the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. the fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the gram-positive bacterial strains. the gram-negative strain p. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. the composition of the atmosphere generated by the eos, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. as a general rule, mic (fungi) << mic (bacteria) with no clear differences between gram-positive or -negative strains except for p. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the eos in the vapor phase. the atmosphere generated from the eos was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. differences among the volatiles in the eos, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.
characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
update on antimicrobial agents: new indications of older agents.
the discovery of newly recognised pathogens and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance have led to the development of new antimicrobial agents or to new indications for older agents. the indications have continued to increase because of new discoveries on the older agents' antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial activities. macrolides and tetracyclines have received attention for their non-antimicrobial properties and potential use in chronic inflammatory disorders. doxycycline, minocycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole regained interest for their activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, whereas colistin has regained interest for its activity against multiple drug-resistant, gram-negative pathogens (i.e., pseudomonas aeruginosa). despite the recent development of new antimicrobial agents, older and less costly agents maintain an important role today in the treatment of infectious diseases.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-023 (ro4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
cs-023 (ro4908463, formerly r-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the c-2 position. its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. cs-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cs-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against p. aeruginosa and mrsa, with mics at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. cs-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris. cs-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the in vivo efficacy of cs-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of prsp (serotypes 6 and 19). against the systemic infections with prsp, mrsa, and p. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of cs-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against p. aeruginosa infections only). these results suggest that cs-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including mrsa and p. aeruginosa.
synthesis of some novel benzoxazole derivatives as anticancer, anti-hiv-1 and antimicrobial agents.
in an effort to establish new candidates with improved antineoplastic, anti-hiv-1 and antimicrobial activities we report here the synthesis and in vitro biological evaluation of various series of 2-substituted benzoxazoles: 2-[(arylhydrazono, arylidene, cycloalkylidene and n-substituted thiocarbamoyl)cyanomethyl]-benzoxazoles(2-4 and 7, respectively); 2-[(4- or 5-oxothiazoliden-2-yliden)benzoxazoles (5 and 6) and 2-(4-amino-3-substituted-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydrothiazol-5-yl)benzoxazoles (8), together with the synthesis of some substituted 3h-pyrido[2,1-b]benzoxazoles (9-11). the absolute configuration of compound 3b was determined by x-ray crystallography. the results of the in vitro anticancer screening revealed that some of the tested compounds exhibited broad spectrum antitumor activity. the most active compounds are 2a, 3b, 8a and 8d, their gi50 mg-mid values: 37.7, 19.1, 20.0 and 15.8 microm; tgi mg-mid values: 75.9, 53.7, 53.7, and 58.9 microm; and lc50 mg-mid values: 97.7, 93.3, 89.1 and 93.3 microm, respectively. the in vitro microbiological data showed that compound 7c was the most active against staphylococcus aureus (minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)<12.5 microg ml(-1). while compounds 5, 8a, and 8d were the most active against bacillus subtilis (mic values<12.5 microg ml(-1)). on the other hand, compounds 5 and 7c were the most active against escherichia coli (mic<25 microg ml(-1)), their activity is about half the activity of ampicillin and streptomycin . in addition, compound 4b and 7c were the most active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic<25, 50 microg ml(-1)). compound 4b was two times as active as ampicillin and streptomycin while compound 7c was active as both. the results of antimycotic activity indicated that, compound 7c showed mild activity against candida albicans when compared with clotrimazole (mic<100 microg ml(-1)). in vitro hiv-1 testing revealed that compound 7a displayed moderate anti-hiv-1 activity (maximum % cell protection, 36.6 at 2 x 10(-5) microm).
ablation of the sympathetic nervous system decreases gram-negative and increases  gram-positive bacterial dissemination: key roles for tumor necrosis factor/phagocytes and interleukin-4/lymphocytes.
the sympathetic nervous system is intensely activated during bacteremia, but its  immediate influence on the bacterial tissue burden remains unclear. we demonstrate that prior ablation of the sympathetic nervous system decreases this dissemination of pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli through a mechanism of increased secretion of peritoneal tumor necrosis factor, improved phagocytic response of peritoneal cells, and increased influx of monocytes into the peritoneal cavity. when gram-positive staphylococcus aureus strains were used, sympathectomy increased the bacterial tissue burden, which was caused by a reduction in corticosterone tonus, and decreased both interleukin-4 secretion from peritoneal cells and the influx of lymphocytes into the peritoneal cavity. in both models, the peritoneal wall was the critical border for systemic infection. these results show the dual role of the sympathetic nervous system in sepsis. it can be favorable or unfavorable, depending on the innate immune effector mechanisms necessary to overcome infection.
[antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin under various conditions against standard strains, beta-lactam resistant strains, and multidrug efflux system mutants].
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of fosfomycin (fom) as prophylactic antibiotic in terms of antimicrobial activity and the potential of inducibility of beta-lactamase, compared with cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, and piperacillin that are commonly used as perioperative agents. the in vitro activity of fom against aerobic gram-negative bacteria using mueller-hinton agar or nutrient agar supplemented with glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) as tested medium increased within a range from 2 to 256 times the activity in the medium without g6p. however, the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria to fom remained largely unchanged with or without g6p. there was no aerobic- or anaerobic-bacteria which changed susceptibility against beta-lactam antibiotics under various tested medium conditions. fom demonstrated strong bactericidal activity against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a dose dependent manner, and decreased viable cell counts of staphylococcus aureus. in the case of p. aeruginosa, transmission electron micrographs study revealed that numerous lysed cells were present 2 hours after treatment with fom at four times the mic. first and second generation cephalosporins induced ampc-type beta-lactamase in a dose dependent manner among beta-lactamase inducible strains of p. aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. on the other hand, inducible activity of fom on beta-lactamase production was less than 1/25 to 1/65 compared with those of cephalosporins. in addition, fom maintained strong antimicrobial activity for over then 20 years after marketing, because of the excellent stability against various types of beta-lactamase produced by plasmid-carrying bacteria and clinical isolates. fom was not extruded by four types of efflux systems, such as mexab-oprm, mexcd-oprj, mexxy/ oprm and mexef-oprn, however beta-lactam antibiotics were substrates of mexab-oprm and mexcd-oprj. in conclusion, fom provides adequate coverage for both aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria causing postoperative infections. further, fom would not select/concentrate beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the clinical fields and would not be a substrate for multidrug efflux system of p. aeruginosa.
antimicrobial and chemoattractant activity, lipopolysaccharide neutralization, cytotoxicity, and inhibition by serum of analogs of human cathelicidin ll-37.
antimicrobial peptides have been evaluated in vitro and in vivo as alternatives to conventional antibiotics. apart from being antimicrobial, the native human cathelicidin-derived peptide ll-37 (amino acids [aa] 104 to 140 of the human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide) also binds and neutralizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) and might therefore have beneficial effects in the treatment of septic shock. however, clinical trials have been hampered by indications of toxic effects of ll-37 on mammalian cells and evidence that its antimicrobial effects are inhibited by serum. for the present study, ll-37 was compared to two less hydrophobic fragments obtained by n-terminal truncation, named 106 (aa 106 to 140) and 110 (aa 110 to 140), and to a previously described more hydrophobic variant, the 18-mer llkkk, concerning antimicrobial properties, lipopolysaccharide neutralization, toxicity against human erythrocytes and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, chemotactic activity, and inhibition by serum. ll-37, fragments 106 and 110, and the 18-mer llkkk inhibited the growth of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans in a radial diffusion assay, inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular nitric oxide production, and attracted neutrophil granulocytes similarly. while fragments 106 and 110 caused less hemolysis and dna fragmentation in cultured cells than did ll-37, the 18-mer llkkk induced severe hemolysis. the antibacterial effect of fragments 106 and 110 was not affected by serum, while the effect of ll-37 was reduced. we concluded that the removal of n-terminal hydrophobic amino acids from ll-37 decreases its cytotoxicity as well as its inhibition by serum without negatively affecting its antimicrobial or lps-neutralizing action. such ll-37-derived peptides may thus be beneficial for the treatment of patients with sepsis.
rare trisubstituted sesquiterpenes daucanes from the wild daucus carota.
phytochemical and biological investigation of the roots of the wild daucus carota ssp. carota afforded three new and four known compounds, including four sesquiterpenes daucane esters (1-3 [new], and 4), one polyacetylene (5), one sesquiterpene coumarin (6), and sitosterol glucoside. the structures of the new compounds were determined by comprehensive nmr studies, including dept, cosy, noesy, hmqc and hmbc analyses. based on an agar diffusion assay, 1, 2 and 4-6 were screened and found to contain a range of low antibacterial activities against four gram positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptomyces scabies, bacillus subtilus, bacillus cereus) and two gram negative species (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli) as well as antifungal against fusarium oxysporum and aspergillus niger using cup agar diffusion assay.
synthesis and study of antibacterial and antifungal activities of novel 8-methyl-7,9-diaryl-1,2,4,8-tetraazaspiro[4.5]decan-3-thiones.
some novel spiropiperidinyl-1,2,4-triazolidin-3-thiones have been synthesized and studied for their antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against candida albicans, candida-6, candida-51, aspergillus niger and aspergillus flavus. compounds 30-32 exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa whereas the same set of compounds exerted potent in vitro antifungal activity against candida-6, a. niger and a. flavus.
temporal changes in bacterial resistance in german intensive care units, 2001-2003: data from the sari (surveillance of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units) project.
conservative testing revealed a stable antibiotic resistance situation for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae in 32 german intensive care units (icus) actively participating in the sari (surveillance of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in icus) project over a three-year period (2001--2003). no significant changes were shown for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (p=0.501; the mrsa rate increased in 18 icus and decreased in 14 icus). the only exception was an increase in ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli.
antidiarrhoeal activity of the methanol extract of the barks of xylocarpus moluccensis in castor oil- and magnesium sulphate-induced diarrhoea models in mice.
the methanol (meoh) extract of the barks of xylocarpus moluccensis, and different fractions of this extract were studied for antidiarrhoeal activity using castor oil- and magnesium sulphate-induced diarrhoea models in mice. at the doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg, the meoh extract showed significant antidiarrhoeal activity in both models. the etoac fraction (eaf) and the residual meoh fraction (rmf) exhibited similar activity using a dose of 250 mg/kg in both models. no antidiarrhoeal activity was observed with the chloroform fraction (chf) at the test doses. when tested for antibacterial effect, the meoh extract displayed moderate inhibitory activity against escherichia coli, vibrio cholera, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, shigella dysentery, staphylococcus pyogenes, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. while the chf inhibited the growth of escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus epidermis, staphylococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the eaf was active against all test organisms except vibrio cholera and staphylococcus epidermis. the rmf inhibited the growth of all the test organisms with moderate zone of inhibition. on the basis of these findings, it can be assumed that xylocarpus moluccensis could be a potential source for novel 'lead' discovery for antidiarrhoeal drug development.
organometallic-based antibacterial and antifungal compounds: transition metal complexes of 1,1'-diacetylferrocene-derived thiocarbohydrazone, carbohydrazone, thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone.
organometallic-based, 1,1'-diacetylferrocene-derived antibacterial and antifungal thiocarbohydrazone, carbohydrazone, thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone have been prepared by condensing equimolar amount of 1,1'-diacetylferrocene with thiocarbohydrazide, carbohydrazide thiosemicarbazide and semicarbazide, respectively. these were used as ligands for the preparation of their cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) metal complexes. all the synthesized ligands and their complexes were characterized by ir, nmr, elemental analyses, molar conductances, magnetic moments and electronic spectral data. these synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, bacillus subtillis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi, and for antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glaberata using the agar-well diffusion method. all the compounds showed good antibacterial and antifungal activity which increased on coordination with the metal ions thus, introducing a novel class of organometallic-based antibacterial and antifungal agents.
bacterial adherence to titanium surface coated with human serum albumin.
hypothesis: an albumin coating on titanium implants will inhibit bacterial adhesion on the implant surface. background: bacterial, protein, and platelet adhesion on otologic implants and tympanostomy tubes is a major reason for implant sequelae and can eventually lead to implant removal. the role of albumin coating of the implant in prevention of protein adhesion on implant surface has already been tested by the authors. in the present study the authors examined the in vitro adherence of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa on an albumin-coated and uncoated titanium surface. methods: human serum albumin (hsa)-coated and uncoated titanium surfaces were exposed to viable s. aureus and p. aeruginosa and, after washings, photographed by fluorescence microscopy to quantify the adhered bacteria, which was stained with acridine orange. results: bacteria in the suspension adhered at a significantly lesser rate to the coated surfaces than to the uncoated surfaces, with overall bacterial adhesion dependent on bacterial concentration. binding of s. aureus on hsa-coated surfaces was inhibited significantly (from 82 to 95% depending on concentration). binding of p. aeruginosa was inhibited from 29 to 37%. conclusion: because albumin coating can reduce bacterial adherence on titanium surfaces in vitro, reduction is possible in bacterial contamination and infection of the hsa-coated titanium implant in vivo.
chemical composition and antibacterial activity of propolis collected by three different races of honeybees in the same region.
the chemical analysis and antibacterial activity of three types of propolis collected three different races of apis mellifera bee in the same apiary were investigated. propolis samples were investigated by gc/ms, 48 compounds were identified 32 being new for propolis. the compounds identified indicated that the main plant sources of propolis were populus alba, populus tremuloides and salix alba. the antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans was evaluated. ethanolic extracts of propolis samples showed high antibacterial activity against gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus aureus), but had a weak activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and yeast (candida albicans). propolis sample collected by apis mellifera caucasica showed a higher antibacterial activity than collected by apis mellifera anatolica and apis mellifera carnica.
effects of quorum sensing molecules of pseudomonas aeruginosa on organism growth, elastase b production, and primary adhesion to hydrogel contact lenses.
purpose: extracellular proteinase production and biofilm structure of pseudomonas aeruginosa are affected by acylated homoserine lactones (ahls) termed quorum sensing (qs) factors. c12- and c4-ahls of p. aeruginosa and a synthetic furanone signaling antagonist were evaluated for effects on growth, primary adhesion to hydrogel contact lenses, and elastase b production of p. aeruginosa strains, including qs mutants, and isolates of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. methods: acylated homoserine lactones and furanone were added to cultures of bacteria at various growth stages. primary adhesion of p. aeruginosa to lenses soaked in ahls and furanone was examined by adenosine triphosphate analysis. elastase b activity of cultures exposed to ahls and furanone was determined by an elastin congo red assay. results: acylated homoserine lactones had no significant effects on maximal cell densities or primary adhesion. adhesion of a lasi-rhli- qs mutant to lenses was significantly lower than its wild-type (wt) strain, regardless of added ahl or furanone. exogenous ahls had negligible effects on elastase production of wt p. aeruginosa but restored elastase production in qs-deficient mutants. the furanone was biocidal for staphylococci but enhanced growth of the lasi-rhli- qs mutant. the furanone decreased elastase production of wt strains but increased qs mutant elastase production. conclusions: exogenous ahls and the furanone were of minor importance in initial adhesion of p. aeruginosa to lenses. the furanone decreased staphylococci growth and elastase production of wt p. aeruginosa but increased growth and elastase production of qs mutants. the data further indicate strain diversity in p. aeruginosa and complexity of ahl systems.
results of an antimicrobial control program at a university hospital.
purpose: the results of the first five years of an ongoing antimicrobial control  program are reported. methods: in 1998, a multidisciplinary antimicrobial subcommittee of the pharmacy and therapeutics committee of a university hospital was formed and charged with making formulary interventions in an effort to reduce rising antimicrobial resistance rates and drug expenditures. in 1999, a number of measures were implemented for controlling antimicrobial use. selected antimicrobials with the potential for inappropriate use or whose inappropriate use had been documented were placed in the control of physicians in the infectious diseases (id) division. prior approval by an id physician was required before the pharmacy could dispense these agents. other key interventions included removal of ceftazidime and cefotaxime from the formulary, restriction of vancomycin and carbapenem use, and replacement of ciprofloxacin with levofloxacin as the sole fluoroquinolone on the formulary. data regarding antimicrobial use and expenditures between 1998 and 2002 were compared and analyzed. results: antimicrobial use was reduced by 80% for third-generation cephalosporins and 15% for vancomycin following the implementation of the new antimicrobial policies. antimicrobial-resistance patterns for many important gram-negative pathogens, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, demonstrated a reversal of previous increases. in addition, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus decreased by an average of 3% each year from 1999 to 2002. pharmacy expenditures for all antimicrobials, including antiviral, antifungal, and antibacterial agents, decreased 24.7%, with a cumulative cost saving of 1,401,126 us dollars, without inflation assumptions. conclusion: the implementation of an antimicrobial control program decreased the use of selected antimicrobial agents and resulted in substantial reduction of expenditures for antimicrobials.
phytochemical analysis and in vitro antimicrobial activity of two satureja species essential oils.
the phytochemical gc[sol ]ms analysis and in vitro antimicrobial activity of the  essential oils of the aerial parts of satureja montana l. and satureja cuneifolia ten., collected in croatia were performed. the major compound of s. montana oil was the phenolic monoterpene carvacrol (45.7%). other important compounds were the monoterpenic hydrocarbons p-cymene (12.6%), gamma-terpinene (8.1%) and the oxygen-containing compounds carvacrol methyl ether, borneol, thymol and thymol methyl ether. the volatile oil of s. cuneifolia was characterized as beta-cubebene (8.7%), limonene (8.3%), alpha-pinene (6.9%), spathulenol and beta-caryophyllene. the antimicrobial effects of s. montana and s. cuneifolia oils were found to have a broad spectrum activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens by the broth microdilution method. these oils were active against all the test strains, with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa. compared with s. cuneifolia, savory oil exhibited greater antimicrobial activity. the maximum activity of savory oil was observed against escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and against the yeast (candida albicans). the essential oil of s. cuneifolia was also found to inhibit the growth of medically important pathogens such as s. aureus and e. coli. fungicidal activity for both oils against c. albicans and s. cerevisiae was also observed.
[sequential microbiological monitoring of tracheal aspirates in intubated patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit].
objective: to evaluate, sequentially, tracheal aspirates from patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit and to associate these pathogens with length of hospital stay, previous use of antimicrobial therapy and diagnoses of ventilator-associated pneumonia. methods: the study population consisted of patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit, between november 2002 and december 2003, on ventilator support. three tracheal aspirates were collected serially from each patient. the first tracheal aspirate sample was obtained 6 hours after admission to the intensive care unit and the remaining samples were collected after 48 and 96 hours. results: one hundred patients aged from one day to 14 years were assessed. positive tracheal cultures were observed to have increased in the three tracheal aspirate samples collected from each patient for pseudomonas aeruginosa, from 6 to 22% (p = 0.002), and to have decreased for staphylococcus aureus, from 23 to 8% (p = 0.009). isolation of candida spp increased for the subset that had received previous antimicrobial therapy (p < 0.05). sixteen (23.5%) out of 68 patients admitted without pneumonia developed ventilator-associated pneumonia. positive tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained in 10 out of 16 of these patients: six were positive for staphylococcus aureus (three associated with acinetobacter baumanii), two for klebsiella spp (one associated with enterobacter spp), one for pseudomonas aeruginosa and one for candida spp. conclusion: sequential evaluation of tracheal aspirates may be useful to track changes in bacterial flora at pediatric intensive care units.
survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
some pharmacological properties of extracts of terminalia sericea roots.
terminalia sericea burch. ex. dc (combretaceae) extracts are used to treat bacterial infections, diarrhea, and diabetes. intermediate and polar extracts of the roots exhibited antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus anthracis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the petroleum ether extract was inactive. the extracts were mildly active against bacillus anthracis and pseudomonas aeruginosa but exhibited the highest activity against staphylococcus aureus. they also exhibited antifungal activity against candida albicans and aspergillus niger. an 80% aqueous ethanol extract of the roots did not have any effect on blood glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt), in mice (p>0.05). with the exception of the dichloromethane and petroleum ether extracts, all the intermediate and polar extracts were toxic to brine shrimps giving lc(50) (95% confidence intervals) values ranging from 5.4 (3.5-8.4) to 17.4 (11.4-26.5) microg/ml, while that of cyclophosphamide, a standard anticancer drug, was 16.3 (10.6-25.2) microg/ml. further work is in progress to isolate and identify active compounds in the extracts.
isatin-derived antibacterial and antifungal compounds and their transition metal  complexes.
a series of isatins incorporating thiazole, thiadiazole, benzothiazole and p-toluene sulfonyl hydrazide moieties, along with their cobalt(ii), copper(ii), nickel(ii) and zinc(ii) metal complexes have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, molar conductances, magnetic moments, ir, nmr and electronic spectral data. these compounds have been screened for antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, bacillus subtillis, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi, and for antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glaberata using the agar-well diffusion method. all the synthesized compounds have shown good affinity as antibacterial and/or antifungal agents which increased in most of the cases on complexation with the metal ions.
characterization and antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin 217 produced by natural isolate lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bgbuk2-16.
the strain lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bgbuk2-16. which was isolated from traditionally homemade white-pickled cheese, produces bacteriocin 217 (bac217; approximately 7 kda). the onset of bac217 biosynthesis was observed in the logarithmic phase of growth, and the production plateau was reached after 9 or 12 h of incubation at 37 and 30 degrees c, respectively, when culture entered the early stationary phase. biochemical characterization showed that bac217 retained antimicrobial activity within the range of ph 3 to 12 or after treatment at 100 degrees c for 15 min. bac217 antimicrobial activity also remained unchanged after storage at 4 degrees c for 6 months or -20 degrees c for up to 12 months. however, bac217 activity was completely lost after treatment with different proteolytic enzymes. bgbuk2-16 contains only one plasmid about 80 kb in size. plasmid curing indicated that genes coding for bac217 synthesis and immunity seem to be located on this plasmid. bac217 exhibited antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. interestingly, bac217 showed activity against salmonella sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853. the inhibitory effect of bgbuk2-16 on the growth of s. aureus in mixed culture was observed. s. aureus treatment with bac217 led to a considerable decrease (cfu/ml) within a short period of time. the mode of bac217 action on s. aureus was identified as bactericidal. it should be noted that the strain bgbuk2-16 was shown to be resistant to bacteriocin nisin, which is otherwise widely used as a food additive for fermented dairy products.
staphylococcus aureus serves as an iron source for pseudomonas aeruginosa during  in vivo coculture.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen often infecting the lungs of individuals with the heritable disease cystic fibrosis and the peritoneum of individuals undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. often these infections are not caused by colonization with p. aeruginosa alone but instead by a consortium of pathogenic bacteria. little is known about growth and persistence of p. aeruginosa in vivo, and less is known about the impact of coinfecting bacteria on p. aeruginosa pathogenesis and physiology. in this study, a rat dialysis membrane peritoneal model was used to evaluate the in vivo transcriptome of p. aeruginosa in monoculture and in coculture with staphylococcus aureus. monoculture results indicate that approximately 5% of all p. aeruginosa genes are differentially regulated during growth in vivo compared to in vitro controls. included in this analysis are genes important for iron acquisition and growth in low-oxygen environments. the presence of s. aureus caused decreased transcription of p. aeruginosa iron-regulated genes during in vivo coculture, indicating that the presence of s. aureus increases usable iron for p. aeruginosa in this environment. we propose a model where p. aeruginosa lyses s. aureus and uses released iron for growth in low-iron environments.
assessment of the antibacterial activity of tea tree oil using the european en 1276 and en 12054 standard suspension tests.
the activity of tea tree oil (tto) and tto-containing products was investigated according to the en 1276 and en 12054 european suspension methods. the activity of different concentrations of tto, a hygienic skin wash (hsw), an alcoholic hygienic skin wash (ahsw) and an alcoholic hand rub (ahr) was investigated. these formulations were assessed in perfect conditions with the en 12054 test, and in perfect conditions as well as in the presence of interfering substances with the en 1276 test, against staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. with the latter test, the activity of the same formulations without tto was also assessed as a control. with the en 1276 test, the ahr achieved a >10(5)-fold reduction against all four test organisms within a 1-min contact time. the ahsw achieved a >or=10(5)-fold reduction against a. baumannii after a 1-min contact time and against s. aureus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa after a 5-min contact time. the efficacy of tto appeared to be dependent on the formulation and the concentration tested, the concentration of interfering substances and, lastly, the organism tested. nevertheless, 5% tto achieved a >10(4)-fold reduction in p. aeruginosa cell numbers after a 5-min contact time in perfect conditions. tto (5%) in 0.001% tween 80 was significantly more active against e. coli and p. aeruginosa than against s. aureus and a. baumannii. with the en 12054 test, after a 1-min contact time, 5% tto in 0.001% tween 80 and the ahsw achieved a >10(4)-fold reduction in e. coli and a. baumannii cell numbers, respectively, and the ahr achieved a >4 log10 reduction against all organisms tested. the formulations used in this study are now being tested using a novel ex vivo method as well as the in vivo european standard handwashing method en 1499.
inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of helicobacter pylori.
aims: to examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on helicobacter pylori (hp) growth. methods and results: the effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. the inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and hp strains, and were method dependent. the caga status of hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. conclusions: helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. the success and progress of hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. significance and impact of the study: this study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. these results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.
allylthiosulfinate: beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex: preparation, characterization and microbiological activity.
an allylthiosulfinate: beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex was synthesized and characterized using x-ray crystallography, ir spectroscopy, thermal analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance. the microbiological activity of the complex was tested on available fungi (candida albicans atcc 10231, aspergillus niger atcc 16404) and bacteria (staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 9027). in small concentrations, the complex inhibited the growth of the microorganisms tested. the most susceptible microorganism was candida albicans atcc 10231, and the least susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 9027.
use of the 'ex vivo' test to study long-term bacterial survival on human skin and their sensitivity to antisepsis.
aims: to determine bacterial survival on human skin and their sensitivity to antisepsis. methods and results: an 'ex vivo' protocol which uses human skin samples placed into diffusion cells, and electron microscopy (em), were used to study the growth of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa inoculated onto skin samples over a 46-h incubation period at 32 degrees c. concurrently variation in skin ph was evaluated at different time intervals during this period. in addition the antimicrobial activity of three antiseptics against the incubated micro-organisms was assessed quantitatively with the 'ex vivo' test, while their detrimental effects against bacteria were observed by em. all three bacteria were still present in high number after 46 h inoculation on skin, although the concentration of e. coli and s. aureus were reduced by 2.74 and 1.58 log(10) reduction, respectively, over this period of time. electron micrographs showed clear evidence of cell division and some bacteria appeared to be embedded into the skin layers. the antiseptics tested had some antibacterial activity against bacteria incubated on skin for 3 and 10 h, and em evidence showed some morphological damages including cellular blebbing and the presence of fibrillar material around the cells. all micro-organisms had an acidifying effect on skin samples. conclusions: here, it was shown that bacterial pathogens can survive and grow when incubated on human skin. in addition, it is possible that they can penetrate the stratum corneum, which can provide some protection against antisepsis. significance and impact of the study: the apparent low bactericidal activity of biocides attributed in part to bacterial protection from skin layers is particularly important to assess in order to ensure antisepsis efficacy.
syntheses, in vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of a series of 3-substituted succinimides.
we have synthesized a series of 3-substituted succinimides and their in vitro antibacterial activities have been tested towards gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from the atcc collection. some of them possess significant antibacterial activity against gram-positive organisms (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) but all are poorly active or inactive against gram-negative organisms (escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853). the compounds with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations (esters of 3-hydroxy succinimides) are also the most cytotoxic against green monkey vero cell line (atcc ccl-81) and could explain that perhaps apoptosis should be implicated in eukaryotic cell cytotoxicity of succinimides.
[bacterial interaction and indirect pathogenesis of pseudomonas aeruginosa at the growth of mrsa].
bacterial interactions such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) growth inhibition or inactivation of anti-mrsa antibiotics by pseudomonas aeruginosa as an indirect pathogen were tested by in vitro assay. paired strains, p. aeruginosa and mrsa, used in this experiment were isolated from 63 respiratory samples at juntendo university hospital from 2002 to 2003. growth inhibitory activities against mrsa by p. aeruginosa were tested with reversed agar plate method. inactivation of anti-mrsa antibiotics by p. aeruginosa were assayed with disk diffusion method using agar over lay technique. fifty-six (88.9%) out of 63 samples showed the significant mrsa growth inhibitory activity by co-existed p. aeruginosa. anti-mrsa antibiotics such as trimetoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination (st), arbekacin (abk) and minocycline (mino) except vancomycin (vcm) and teicoplanin (teic) were inactivated by the co-existed p. aeruginosa. our data suggests that p. aeruginosa may play not only as a chronic respiratory pathogen but also as an indirect pathogen. further, the most p. aeruginosa with anti-mrsa activity isolated respiratory sample may play as a modulator of mrsa infection.
usnic acid, a natural antimicrobial agent able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on polymer surfaces.
in modern medicine, artificial devices are used for repair or replacement of damaged parts of the body, delivery of drugs, and monitoring the status of critically ill patients. however, artificial surfaces are often susceptible to colonization by bacteria and fungi. once microorganisms have adhered to the surface, they can form biofilms, resulting in highly resistant local or systemic infections. at this time, the evidence suggests that (+)-usnic acid, a secondary lichen metabolite, possesses antimicrobial activity against a number of planktonic gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. since lichens are surface-attached communities that produce antibiotics, including usnic acid, to protect themselves from colonization by other bacteria, we hypothesized that the mode of action of usnic acid may be utilized in the control of medical biofilms. we loaded (+)-usnic acid into modified polyurethane and quantitatively assessed the capacity of (+)-usnic acid to control biofilm formation by either s. aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa under laminar flow conditions by using image analysis. (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymers did not inhibit the initial attachment of s. aureus cells, but killing the attached cells resulted in the inhibition of biofilm. interestingly, although p. aeruginosa biofilms did form on the surface of (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymer, the morphology of the biofilm was altered, possibly indicating that (+)-usnic acid interfered with signaling pathways.
in vitro testing of antimicrobial activity of bone cement.
the purpose of this study was to establish a reliable and cost-effective microplate proliferation assay for in vitro antimicrobial testing of bone cement samples. cement samples devoid of antimicrobial agents, loaded with 2% gentamicin or with different concentrations of high-porosity silver, were incubated in a 96-well microplate with several staphylococcal, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecium isolates exhibiting different susceptibilities to gentamicin. after being rinsed, the samples were brought into a soy medium in which adherent cells on the cement surface either were killed by the antimicrobial surface or started to release clonal counterparts. the medium was monitored in real time by recording a time proliferation curve for each well. microplate testing revealed no antibacterial effect of plain bone cement. the antibacterial activity of gentamicin-loaded bone cement was shown by the microplate test to depend on the gentamicin susceptibilities of the strains. the effect of high-porosity silver was dose dependent. bactericidal activity against all tested strains was found for bone cement loaded with 1% high-porosity silver. the accuracy of this new proliferation assay was shown by the high correlation between the types of proliferation curves and antibiotic susceptibility. in contrast to routine agar diffusion testing, it assesses the dynamic response of microorganisms to antimicrobial agents in biomaterials and allows high-throughput screening and detection of antimicrobial properties of poorly water-soluble compounds like silver.
antibacterial and antifugal mono- and di-substituted symmetrical and unsymmetrical triazine-derived schiff-bases and their transition metal complexes.
a new series of antibacterial and antifungal triazine-derived mono- and di-substituted (symmetrical and unsymmetrical) schiff-bases and their cobalt(ii), copper(ii), nickel(ii) and zinc(ii) metal complexes have been synthesized and characterized by their elemental analyses, molar conductances, magnetic moments and ir and electronic spectral measurements. ir spectra indicated the ligands to act as tridentate towards divalent metal ions via a trazine-n, the azomethine-n and, indole-nh and deprotonated-o of salicylaldehyde. the magnetic moments and electronic spectral data suggest octahedral geometry for the co(ii), ni(ii) and zn(ii)complexes and square-pyramid for cu(ii) complexes. nmr spectral data of the ligands and their diamagnetic zinc(ii) complexes well-define their proposed structures/geometries. elemental analyses data of the ligands and metal complexes agree with their proposed structures/geometries. the synthesized ligands, along with their metal complexes were screened for their antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, bacillus subtillis, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi and for antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial/ antifungal against two or more species as compared to the uncomplexed schiff-base ligands.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). i. susceptibility distribution].
the bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 13 institutions in japan were supplied between august 2002 and july 2003. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. the number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). against staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (vcm) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/ml. the susceptibility of staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (ctm) was relatively good. against enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (abpc), imipenem (ipm), and vcm showed the strongest antibacterial activity (mic90: 2-4 microg/ml). in addition, the low sensitive strains (mic: > or = 256 microg/ml) to clarithromycin (cam) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (czop). the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially czop and cefpirome (cpr) showed the highest activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. the antibacterial activity of cephems to citrobacter freundii was generally low but czop and cpr had a strong acitivity (mic90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). the antibacterial activity of cephems to klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (cmx), cefixime (cfix), flomoxef (fmox), cpr, and czop showed stronger activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). against serratia marcescens, meropenem (mepm) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by cpr and czop. against proteus mirabilis, cmx, ceftazidime (caz), cpr, mepm, carumonam (crmn), and levofloxacin (lvfx) showed the strongest activity (mc90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). among other cephems, czop and cfix were also strong (mic90: 0.25 microg/ml). the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and mic90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/ml except ipm and amikacin (amk) having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of czop was relatively good (mic50: 8 microg/ml).
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2002)].
from october 2002 to september 2003, we collected the specimen from 476 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 584 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 578 strains were examined. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 77, streptococcus pneumoniae 103, haemophilus influenzae 95, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 61, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 23, klebsiella pneumoniae 36, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 29, etc. of 77 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (mpipc) [methicillin-susceptible s. aureus: mssa] was 34 strains (44.2%) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) was 43 strains (55.8%). against mssa, imipenem (ipm) and minocycline (mino) had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. although clindamycin (cldm) and aminoglycosides also had the potent activity, the resistant strains against those agents were detected. cefotiam (ctm) inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml without the low sensitive strains. against mrsa, vancomycin (vcm) showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. arbekacin (abk) also showed the relatively potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/ml. cefozopran (czop) also had a preferable activity (mic90: 1 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. in contrast, the resistant strains for cefaclor (ccl), erythromycin (em), cldm, and tetracycline (tc) were detected in 50.5%, 76.7%, 50.5%, and 80.6% of all the strains, respectively. against h. influenzae, lvfx showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of 92 of all the strains (96.8%) at 0.063 microg/ml. tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of czop was good and its mic90 against mucoid and non-mucoid strains was 8 and 16 microg/ml, respectively. czop and cefpirome (cpr) were the most potent against k. pneumoniae with 0.125 microg/ml of mic90. also, all the agents generally showed potent activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis and the mic90 of all drugs were 4 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (47.5%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. as for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 35.7 and 33.8% of all the patients, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. pneumoniae (22.6%). in contrast, s. aureus (16.6%) and p. aeruginosa (13.7%) were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were h. influenzae (24.5%) and s. pneumoniae (24.2%). in comparison of the isolated bacteria by pretreatment agents, p. aeruginosa was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with cephems or macrolides and h. influenzae was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with penicillins.
newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
four carbapenems have been available clinically in japan. these are imipenem/cilastatin (imip/cs) and panipenem/ betamipron (pani/bp) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (biap) and meropenem (mero). the latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. the antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against enterobacteriacae such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli containing the class c-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (pipc) and ceftazidime (ctaz). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to pipc and ctaz. high activities were also seen against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected. the first generation carbapenems showed better activity against e. faecalis than newer carbapenems. all four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (utis). however, pani/bp is less effective in utis caused by p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. mero showed better eradication rate of p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated utis, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis.
comparative analysis of antibiotic and antimicrobial biocide susceptibility data  in clinical isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa between 1989 and 2000.
aims: to analyse population minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) data from clinical strains of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa for changes over a 10-year period and to look for correlations between the antimicrobials tested. methods and results: data from the mic study of 256 clinical isolates of staph. aureus [169 methicillin-sensitive staph. aureus (mssa), 87 methicillin-resistant staph. aureus (mrsa)] and 111 clinical isolates of ps. aeruginosa against eight antimicrobial biocides and several clinically relevant antibiotics was analysed using anova, spearman-rho correlation and principal component analysis. comparisons suggest that alterations in the mean susceptibility of staph. aureus to antimicrobial biocides have occurred between 1989 and 2000, but that these changes were mirrored in mssa and mrsa suggests that methicillin resistance has little to do with these changes. between 1989 and 2000 a sub-population of mrsa has acquired a higher resistance to biocides, but this has not altered the antibiotic susceptibility of that group. in both staph. aureus and ps. aeruginosa several correlations (both positive and negative) between antibiotics and antimicrobial biocides were found. conclusions: from the analyses of these clinical isolates it is very difficult to support a hypothesis that increased biocide resistance is a cause of increased antibiotic resistance either in staph. aureus or in ps. aeruginosa. significance and impact of the study: the observation of negative correlations between antibiotics and biocides may be a useful reason for the continued use of biocides promoting hygiene in the hospital environment.
recovery of the susceptibility of isolated bacterium achieved by giving long-established antibiotics as prophylaxis against postoperative infections.
purpose: to evaluate the effectiveness of operative antibiotic therapy we changed the antibiotics and examined the susceptibility of the postoperative infection. methods: we studied 4 593 patients who underwent gastrointestinal surgery during the last 12.5 years, and examined the changes in intraoperative antibiotics, the return of bacteria isolated from infectious sites, the trends in frequency of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolation, and changes in the antibiotic susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacterioides fragilis. we changed the antibiotics to cefazolin (cez) for upper gastrointestinal tract surgery and cholecystectomy, and to cefotiam (ctm) for colonic, liver, and pancreatic surgery. we also reduced the period of drug administration. results: the rate of mrsa infections decreased, the rate of p. aeruginosa infections was always under 20% and the rate of b. fragilis infections increased. after the guidelines of drug susceptibility were prepared, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefsulodin (cfs) and piperacillin (pipc) for p. aeruginosa and of latamoxef (lmox) and pipc for b. fragilis, decreased. conclusion: the use of antibiotics considered comparatively old for the prophylaxis of postoperative infection prevented the emergence of mrsa-like resistant strains, influenced changes in gram-negative bacteria drug susceptibility, and led to an overall reduction in multiple drug resistance.
[antimicrobial activity of organic extracts isolated from aplysina fistularis (demospongiae: aplysinidae)].
organic extracts of the sponge aplysina fistularis (pallas 1766) were tested for  antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and toxic activity of extract were determined. susceptibility trials of organic fractions obtained by vlc: hexane, etoac and chcl3 showed that etoac fraction has antibacterial activity against e. coli, while chcl3 fraction inhibited e. coli and s. aureus growth. the later refractioning of etoac fraction and the biodirected assays showed that fractions f12 and f13 of etoac/hex and etoac f14 were bioactive against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. only etoac/meoh sf2 from subfractionig of etoac f14 produced inhibition for e. coli and s. aureus. in sf2 etoac/meoh, mic was moderate for s. aureus (mic > 256 g/ml). f4 chcl3/meoh produced a high inhibition in s. aureus (mic = 0.125 g/ml) and for e. coli (mic > 16 g/ml). f10 chcl3/meoh showed a moderate activity against s. aureus (mic > 128 g/ml) and low activity against e. coli (mic = 512 g/ml). f10 chcl3/meoh did no present toxic activity against artemia salina. the fractiorts f4 chcl3/meoh and sf2 etoac/meoh were toxic for this organism when the concentration was higher than 100 microg/ml. lc50 in both cases was 548.4 and 243.4 microg/ml respectively. secondary metabolites of medium polarity obtained from a. fistularis have a wide spectrum of anti bacterial activity. toxicity analysis suggests that only f10 chcl3/meoh has potential as an antimicrobial agent for clinical use.
microbiological data for patients with febrile neutropenia.
the pattern of bacterial infections and antimicrobial susceptibility has changed  significantly during the past 20-30 years. the causative organisms for bacteremia or fungemia identified at kinki university hospital in 1985-1996 were compared with the isolates identified during 1997-2002. the prevalence of gram-negative organisms decreased, whereas the prevalence of gram-positive organisms increased. staphylococcal species predominated in the second period, accounting for 22% of isolates, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) increased from 5% to 14% of isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked second, although the prevalence decreased in the second period compared with the first. candida species were also relatively frequent (11%). enterococcal species had an 8% prevalence. a comparison of all culture isolates showed that gram-negative isolates still predominated among the general patient population, whereas almost equal prevalence was observed in patients with hematological diseases. mrsa was the organism most frequently isolated in the general patient population, followed by p. aeruginosa. among staphylococcal species, mrsa accounted for as much as 90% of isolates.
synthesis and study of antibacterial and antifungal activities of novel 1-[2-(benzoxazol-2-yl)ethoxy]- 2,6-diarylpiperidin-4-ones.
some novel benzoxazolylethoxypiperidones have been synthesized and their antibacterial activity against streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus aand pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against candida-6, candida albicans, aspergillus niger, candida-51 and aspergillus flavus were evaluated. compounds 37, 38 and 39 exerted potent in vitro antibacterial activity against streptococcus faecalis while compounds 40 and 41 exhibited potent in vitro antifungal activity against candida-51.
a novel carrier molecule for high-level expression of peptide antibiotics in escherichia coli.
peptide antibiotics are often hard to express in engineered bacteria at high level. according to the properties of peptide antibiotics, a heterologous protein pap3.30, encoded by orf30 of pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage pap3, was selected as a carrier molecule. the gene of the carrier molecule was constructed into the plasmid pqe-32 to give rise to the vector pqe-pap30 for expression of peptide antibiotics in escherichia coli. a his-tagged fusion protein was genetically constructed with a peptide antibiotic at its carboxy terminus. the novel carrier molecule was used for high-level expression of six peptide antibiotics with different sizes and isoelectric points in e. coli, which are hpab-beta, msi-78, melletin, hbd-1, cecropin a, and an ovine anion peptide. and further, one of six peptide antibiotics, hpab-beta (an analog of a human peptide antibiotic), was taken as an example for studies of recovery of interesting products from the fusion partner, purification and antimicrobial activity evaluation. the results indicated that the expressed fusion protein existed as an inclusion body in the cytoplasm and the expression amounts of six peptide antibiotic fusions are all higher than 34% of the total cell protein. the expression products could be easily purified by ni-nta chromatography. cyanogen bromide was used to cut at the methionine linker between the carrier and hpab-beta peptide. hpab-beta was recovered from the fusion partner and purified to homogeneity with high s cation-exchange and bio-gel p6 gel chromatography. the bactericidal activities of the purified recombinant hpab-beta against p. aeruginosa are 31-64 microg/ml, and against staphylococcus aureus are > or = 128 microg/ml, being comparable to that of the chemical synthesis peptide. these results show that the carrier molecule can result in high-level expression of peptide antibiotics, and expression products can be easily recovered from their fusion partner and retain their bioactivity.
comparative in vitro and in vivo study of nine alcohol-based handrubs.
background: hygienic hand disinfection using alcohol-based handrubs (ahrs) is an  alternative method to conventional handwashing in hospital wards. because a documented choice of such products would consider data from in-care evaluation, we designed a comparative study of 9 ahrs both in vitro and in vivo in actual care conditions. methods: the bactericidal activity of ahrs was first measured in vitro against 4 hospital strains exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance: acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter aerogenes. in a second time, ahrs were tested in an intensive care unit for antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of personnel hands and for acceptance by the care personnel. results: the 9 ahrs could be classified in 3 groups on the basis of their in vitro activity: products of the first group showed a bactericidal activity higher than 4 log(10) against the 4 strains. only 1 of these products presented simultaneously an effective antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of care personnel hands and a good acceptance by the care personnel. conclusion: the in vitro study allowed the differentiation of the ahrs tested on the basis of bactericidal activity, but evaluation in an in-care situation allowed further discrimination through both antibacterial activity and acceptance. thus, the combination of in vitro and in vivo evaluations should provide helpful arguments in the choice of ahrs.
antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria most commonly isolated from bone related infections: the role of cephalosporins in antimicrobial therapy.
bone infections, which can be acute or chronic, often require aggressive antibiotic therapy, whether treated at home or in the community. surveillance programmes are essential tools in the monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and can act as a resource to maintain effective prescribing. the surveillance network (tsn), which collects organism and patient-specific data from a network of laboratories across the united states, was used to analyse susceptibility of common bacterial species isolated from bone infections during 2000-2002. narrow-spectrum antimicrobials such as vancomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid demonstrated good activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, and were active against 100% of isolates. however, gram-negative species were also commonly isolated from these sites of infection. later-generation cephalosporins, represented by ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and cefepime, exhibited a broad spectrum of activity including enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, but they were not active against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and showed variable activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. using ceftazidime as a marker for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) expression, less than 3% of escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae expressed this phenotype. based on current in vitro activity, the third-generation cephalosporins provide broad-spectrum coverage useful for the empirical therapy of suspected bone infections, especially for patients treated in the community or hospitalised with community-acquired infections.
effect of storage temperatures and time on the efficacy of multipurpose solutions for contact lenses.
purpose: to determine the effect of storage time and temperature on the efficacy  of four multipurpose solutions for soft contact lenses. method: aliquots of multipurpose solutions (opti-free express, renu multiplus, complete and solo-care) stored at different temperatures over a 3-month period, were challenged with contact lens-related ocular pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. results: the results showed that opti-free express had the best activity against ps. aeruginosa at all temperatures; renu multiplus performed well at 25 degrees c; complete barely achieved activity requirements at all temperatures, and lost efficacy after 2 months. solo-care maintained its activity best against ps. aeruginosa at 30 degrees c. storage at fridge temperature reduced activity of all solutions. regardless of storage temperature, activities of all solutions against s. aureus markedly decreased by 2 months. only opti-free express met fda requirements against c. albicans. conclusion: performance of multipurpose solutions is affected by time and temperature of storage. contact lens users should be aware that the efficacy of opened solutions may not be sustained for as long as 3 months. manufacturers should reconsider their recommendations to further safeguard the ocular health of contact lens wearers.
bacteriology of medically refractory acute otitis media in children: a 9-year retrospective study.
objective: to identify the causative organisms for medically refractory acute otitis media (aom) in children, and to recommend the appropriate antibiotics for these patients. study design: retrospective chart review. methods: the medical records for 671 children (1258 ears) undergoing myringotomies between january 1993 and december 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. "medically refractory" aom is defined as aom requiring emergency myringotomy because of toxicity persisting despite second-phase antibiotics. of these, 18 children were enrolled in our study, with 25 of the ears affected by medically refractory aom. myringotomy was performed for pus drainage, bacterial culture and susceptibility studies in all cases. clinical factors were analyzed to demonstrate possible relationships with microbiological findings. results: bacteria were recovered in specimens taken from 12 ears. the positive culture rate was 48%. bacteriological studies showed mostly growing gram-positive bacteria, such as coagulase negative staphylococcus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae (in decreasing order of incidence). the sensitivity rate to pre-myringotomy antibiotics was 85.7%. with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa and two ears with intracranial complications or pneumonia, all other isolated microorganisms were susceptible to first-generation cephalosporins. no statistically significant differences were noted between culture rates and clinical factors. conclusion: the distribution of organisms in our medically refractory aom cases differed from that for simple aom, with gram-positive bacteria having significantly higher rates of incidence. combining intravenous aminoglycoside with first-generation cephalosporin is considered an inexpensive and effective treatment covering all potential microorganisms. vancomycin or third-generation cephalosporins are only needed for major complications or other coincident infections extant during the initial presentation.
effect of monovalent and divalent cations on the photoinactivation of bacteria with meso-substituted cationic porphyrins.
it is well established that for successful photoinactivation (pi) of gram-negative bacteria a cationic photosensitizer is required. this requirement suggests a charge-dependent interaction between the photosensitizer and the gram-negative bacterium, which may be influenced by the presence of ions in the suspending medium. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of cations na+ and ca2+ on the efficacy of the pi of the gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus. the bacteria were suspended in buffer containing either meso-tetra(n-methyl-4-pyridyl)-porphyrin or meso-mono-phenyl-tri(n-methyl-4-pyridyl)-porphyrin as photosensitizer and various concentrations of na+ or ca2+. the cell suspensions were exposed to a broadband light dose of 9 j/cm2. in buffer without added cations, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were equally sensitive to pi. addition of cations strongly decreased the sensitivity of both bacteria to pi, with the pi of p. aeruginosa being much more decreased than that of s. aureus, and ca2+ being more effective than na+. the decreased sensitivity was accompanied by a reduced binding of the photosensitizers to the bacteria.
trends in the etiology of infectious corneal ulcers at the f. i. proctor foundation.
objective: we analyzed laboratory results from corneal ulcers seen from 1976 to 1999 at the francis i. proctor foundation, a referral center in san francisco, to determine the relative frequencies of pathogens and to analyze for trends in frequencies of the most common pathogens. the results were compared with a previous study of corneal ulcers seen from 1948 to 1976 at the same institution. methods: ulcers presenting to the proctor foundation were gram stained and cultured using standard techniques. herpetic corneal ulcers were excluded from the study. results: organisms were isolated from 427 ulcers, 38% of all cases. two hundred seventy-eight (59%) isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 145 (31%) gram-negative bacteria, 16 (3%) acanthamoeba spp., and 36 (8%) fungi. staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism, composing 20% of all isolates, followed by viridans group streptococci (12%), streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), moraxella spp. (5%), and serratia marcescens (4%). over the 24-year study period the proportion of positive cultures decreased and the incidence of s. marcescens increased significantly. comparing the period of 1948-1976 to 1976-1999, the frequency of s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa decreased, and that of s. marcescens increased significantly. conclusion: the common pathogens associated with corneal ulcers have changed over the past 50 years in northern california, with s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa being isolated relatively less often and s. marcescens being isolated with increasing frequency. the decrease in isolation of organisms over the 1976-1999 period may have resulted from increasing empiric antibiotic treatment by referring ophthalmologists.
whither triclosan?
triclosan has activity against many, but not all, types of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. it is bacteriostatic at low concentrations, but higher concentrations are bactericidal. pseudomonas aeruginosa is highly resistant, whereas methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains are inhibited over a range of approximately 0.1-2 mg/l. triclosan shows significant activity against some mycobacteria, but is not sporicidal. its growth-inhibitory properties result from an inhibition of enoyl reductase, fabi. membrane-destabilizing effects are likely to be responsible for bacterial inactivation by higher concentrations. resistance can arise from mutations in, and/or overproduction of, fabi, impermeability or efflux. whilst triclosan resistance in laboratory experiments may be associated with changes in antibiotic susceptibility, comprehensive environmental surveys have not demonstrated any association between triclosan usage and antibiotic resistance. triclosan has several important uses, and the future aim must be to retain these applications whilst eliminating the more frivolous and unnecessary ones.
antimicrobial activity in methanolic extracts of several plant species from northern argentina.
thirty-nine native plant species were collected from the provinces of chaco and formosa, in northern argentina, and were screened for antimicrobial activity. the plants were dried and extracted thoroughly with methanol. the dry extracts, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, were tested for inhibition of microbial growth via microplate assay with an oxidation-reduction dye. the test organisms were: escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. inhibition of respiratory activities in some of these microbial species was produced by the extracts of astronium balansae, geoffroea decorticans, peltophorum dubium, geoffroea spinosa, lantana balansae, prosopis kuntzei, prosopis ruscifolia and bulnesia sarmientoi, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 0.08 to 0.5 mg dry matter/ml. further in vitro experiments measuring the growth of s. aureus in liquid culture confirmed that all of the above extracts at 2 x mic were able to inhibit bacterial growth effectively, and that some of them (a. balansae, g. decorticans, p. dubium, g. spinosa, p. kuntzei and b. sarmientoi) were able to reduce the initial number of viable counts by at least one order of magnitude in 10 hours, indicating that these extracts should be investigated further for the possible presence of bactericidal components.
screening of antibacterial extracts from plants native to the brazilian amazon rain forest and atlantic forest.
more than 20% of the world's biodiversity is located in brazilian forests and only a few plant extracts have been evaluated for potential antibacterial activity. in the present study, 705 organic and aqueous extracts of plants obtained from different amazon rain forest and atlantic forest plants were screened for antibacterial activity at 100 microg/ml, using a microdilution broth assay against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. one extract, vo581, was active against s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=140 microg/ml and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc)=160 microg/ml, organic extract obtained from stems) and two extracts were active against e. faecalis, sm053 (mic=80 microg/ml and mbc=90 microg/ml, organic extract obtained from aerial parts), and my841 (mic=30 microg/ml and mbc=50 microg/ml, organic extract obtained from stems). the most active fractions are being fractionated to identify their active substances. higher concentrations of other extracts are currently being evaluated against the same microorganisms.
control of microorganisms in vitro by endodontic irrigants.
the aim of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and antimicrobial effectiveness by the direct exposure test of 4 endodontic irrigants [1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl), 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% calcium hydroxide (ca(oh)2; prepared with 1 g of ca(oh)2 and 100 ml of sterile distilled water), a solution of ca(oh)2 + detergent (hct20)] for s. aureus, e. faecalis, p. aeruginosa, b. subtilis, c. albicans and a mixed culture. microbial growth was analyzed by two methods: turbidity of the culture medium that was confirmed by gram stain and subculture in a specific nutrient broth. in the dilution test, naocl solution showed mic equal to 0.1% for s. aureus, e. faecalis, p. aeruginosa and c. albicans and equal to 1% for b. subtilis and the mixed culture. chx (2%) presented mic equal to 0.000002% for s. aureus, 0.02% for e. faecalis, b. subtilis, c. albicans and the mixed culture and 0.002% for p. aeruginosa. ca(oh)2 solution (1%) showed mic greater than 1% for all the microorganisms except p. aeruginosa for which it was equal to 1%. calcium hydroxide solution + detergent showed mic equal to 4.5 ml for s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, b. subtilis, c. albicans and the mixed culture and greater than 4.5 ml for e. faecalis. in the direct exposure test, naocl had better antimicrobial effectiveness for all microorganisms at all times. chx (2%) was effective for s. aureus, e. faecalis and c. albicans at all times, and ineffective for p. aeruginosa, b. subtilis and the mixed culture. the other solutions showed the worst results.
bacteraemia in europe--antimicrobial susceptibility data from the mystic surveillance programme.
the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms isolated from bacteraemic  versus non-bacteraemic patients was evaluated using data (1997-2001) from the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme. minimum inhibitory concentration values and susceptibility breakpoints of meropenem and other broad-spectrum antimicrobials were determined using standard methodology. three thousand one hundred and thirty-six blood culture (bc) isolates and 17261 non-bc isolates were obtained from 51 european mystic centres. gram-positive bacteria appeared to be more prevalent in bc isolates compared with other sources. escherichia coli, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated most frequently. antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from bacteraemic versus non-bacteraemic patients was similar. meropenem and imipenem were the most active agents against the majority of the gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin generally exhibited the lowest activities against the most commonly isolated organisms. meropenem was most active against p. aeruginosa and showed the highest potency and activity against all extended-spectrum and ampc beta-lactamase producers. these results are relevant to the choice of initial, empirical therapy for patients with suspected bacteraemia.
[nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.
identification of novel potent bicyclic peptide deformylase inhibitors.
screening of our compound collection using staphylococcus aureus ni-peptide deformylase (pdf) afforded a very potent pdf inhibitor with an ic(50) in the low nanomolar range but with poor antibacterial activity (mic). three-dimensional structural information obtained from pseudomonas aeruginosa ni-pdf complexed with the inhibitor suggested the synthesis of a variety of analogues that would maintain high binding affinity while attempting to improve antibacterial activity. many of the compounds synthesized proved to be excellent pdf-ni inhibitors and some showed increased antibacterial activity in selected strains.
a ribonuclease with antimicrobial, antimitogenic and antiproliferative activities from the edible mushroom pleurotus sajor-caju.
a 12 kda ribonuclease preferential for poly u and with much lower activity toward poly a, poly g and poly c was isolated from fresh fruiting bodies of the mushroom pleurotus sajor-caju. a purification procedure involving ion exchange chromatography on cm-cellulose, affinity chromatography on red-sepharose and heparin-sepharose, and fast protein liquid chromatography-gel filtration on superdex 75 was used. the ribonuclease was adsorbed on all of the first three types of chromatographic media. it exhibited some activity toward herring sperm dna and calf thymus dna. the ribonuclease activity was unaffected in the presence of kcl (10 and 100 mm) and nacl (100 mm and 1 m), but was strongly inhibited by cuso4 (0.01 and 0.1 mm) and less potently inhibited by other divalent salts including mgcl2, cacl2, zncl2, znso4 and feso4. the optimal ph was 5.5 and the ribonuclease was stable up to 60 degrees c for 1 h. the ribonuclease inhibited mycelial growth in the fungi fusarium oxysporum and mycosphaerella arachidicola with an ic50 value of 95 and 72 microm, respectively. out of the 12 species of bacteria tested, only pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus were inhibited in growth by the ribonuclease. viability of the tumor cells hepg2 (hepatoma) and l1210 (leukemia) was reduced with an ic50 of 0.22 and 0.1 microm, respectively in the presence of the ribonuclease. the ribonuclease inhibited translation in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system with an ic50 of 158 nm and 3h-methyl-thymidine uptake by murine splenocytes with an ic50 of 65 nm.
antimicrobial activity of a low-molecular-weight chitosan obtained from cellulase digestion of chitosan.
a water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. this 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (lmwc), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kda, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. lmwc has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including bacillus cereus, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does lmwc. accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against e. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of lmwc.
the synergistic effect of edta/antimicrobial combinations on pseudomonas aeruginosa.
aims: to demonstrate that the nonlinear concentration-dependent inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa to edta can be used to successfully model and predict the potentiation of antimicrobials by edta. methods and results: a model used successfully to describe the concentration-dependent inhibition of bacterial growth caused by many antimicrobials was unable to describe the inhibition of p. aeruginosa by edta. examination of the inhibition profiles for edta against p. aeruginosa revealed a biphasic inhibitory pattern suggesting different mechanisms of action at different concentrations. a modelled, two-stage inhibitory process was shown to fit the observations. this model was then used to examine the effect of combining edta with other antimicrobials. the apparent synergy of mixtures of edta with quaternary ammonium surfactants (qac) and specific antibiotics was successfully modelled. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the qac and that of oxacillin and cefamandole were reduced by a factor of 3-10, whereas ampicillin was reduced by a factor of 70 from an mic of 1524 to 21 mg l(-1) in the presence of 500 mg l(-1) of edta. conclusions: a nonlinear concentration-dependent inhibition of p. aeruginosa by edta gives rise to apparent observation of synergy with other antimicrobials. significance and impact of the study: this is a further example where the current methodology for the examination of antimicrobial synergy (the summed fractional inhibitory concentrations) leads to false conclusions.
treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis with topical trovafloxacin.
objective: to investigate the therapeutic role of trovafloxacin mesylate, a newer-generation fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum of activity, in the treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis. methods: susceptibility studies were performed on various strains of ocular isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, using the e-test method. pharmacokinetic studies were performed by a single topical administration of trovafloxacin to rabbit eyes with either an intact or denuded corneal epithelium. aqueous humor, vitreous, and corneal concentrations of trovafloxacin were determined at different time points. experimental bacterial keratitis studies were performed in rabbit eyes. three identical studies were conducted using staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. therapy groups included 0.5% trovafloxacin, 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. after 12 hours of drops administration, corneas were excised, homogenized, and serially plated. the main outcome measure was quantitative bacteriologic analysis for residual colony-forming units. results: in vitro susceptibility study findings indicated that the mic of trovafloxacin was significantly lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for staphylococcus epidermidis, and intermediate between ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for p. aeruginosa. pharmacokinetic studies showed a significant concentration of trovafloxacin in the treated corneas, especially in eyes with a denuded epithelium. all serum samples had undetectable trovafloxacin concentrations. experimental keratitis studies showed a statistically significant decrease of colony-forming units in trovafloxacin-treated eyes in the s. aureus model and a similar decrease in the s pneumoniae and p aeruginosa models. conclusions: topical 0.5% trovafloxacin proved to be an effective ocular medication for the therapy of gram-positive and gram-negative keratitis. clinical relevance trovafloxacin may provide an excellent therapeutic alternative in bacterial keratitis.
assessment of the antibacterial activity of selected flavonoids and consideration of discrepancies between previous reports.
activity of the flavonoids apigenin, baicalin and galangin against sensitive and  antibiotic resistant strains of staphylococculs aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. using an agar dilution assay, galangin was shown to have a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 25 to 50 microg/ml against all six strains of s. aureus but negligible activity against the othe species. apigenin displayed only marginal activity against s. aureus and no activity was detected from baicalin. in inhibition curve studies, galangin caused a 100,000-fold decrease in the viability of a growing population of s. aureus nctc 6571 within the first two hours of treatment. decreases in viability of s. aureus nctc 11561 and ncimb 9968 populations were also observed.
shifting trends in in vitro antibiotic susceptibilities for common ocular isolates during a period of 15 years.
purpose: to assess the in vitro susceptibility of the most common ocular bacterial isolates to several antibiotics and verify changing trends in the antibiotic susceptibility in a 15-year period. design: experimental study. methods: all cultures positive for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns), streptococcus sp, and pseudomonas sp in conjunctival (n = 4,585) and corneal (n = 3,779) samples from patients seen at the federal university of sao paulo from 1985 to 2000 were evaluated. cultures were performed in liquid and solid media, and susceptibility tests were done to amikacin, gentamicin, neomycin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, cephalothin, and chloramphenicol. results: amikacin and neomycin showed an improvement of their sensitivity during the study period (88%-95% and 50%-85%, respectively) for corneal and conjunctival samples. gentamicin and tobramycin revealed a decrease of sensitivity in time, from 95% to less than 80% in corneal and conjunctival samples. ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin had good sensitivity to all evaluated bacteria, better in conjunctiva (95%) than in cornea (90%). sensitivity of s. aureus to cephalothin decreased during the study but was still 98% for cns. chloramphenicol had good sensitivity to s. aureus (85% in corneal and 92%in conjunctival samples), cns (87% and 88.5%), and streptococcus sp (95% and 96%). conclusions: gentamicin, tobramycin, and cephalothin decreased their in vitro susceptibility to all tested pathogens. the fluoroquinolones remained a good choice in the treatment of ocular infections, with high suscep-tibility to all pathogens tested. chloramphenicol also revealed an increase in its susceptibility to all bacteria evaluated.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). ii. background of patients].
five-hundred thirty one bacterial strains isolated from 412 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied between september and december 2001. then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age, and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of bacteria isolation by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of antibiotics administration, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. with regard to the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of cases aged lower than 50 years was few and complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent in male patients. in females, the number of patients aged lower than 20 years was few. most of female patients aged lower than 80 years had uncomplicated utis. as for the relationship between type of infections and kind of bacteria, escherichia coli decreased as the infections were more complicated, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis increased as the infections were more complicated. in relation of these results to age of patients, isolation frequency of e. coli gradually decreased with aging in patients aged 20 years and older with uncomplicated utis. the isolation frequencies of e. faecalis decreased with aging in the patients with complicated utis without indwelling catheter while p. aeruginosa decreased with aging in the patients with complicated utis with indwelling catheter. e. coli was isolated a few after administration of antibiotics, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated after administration in the patients with all types of infections. as for type of causative organisms in utis and with or without surgical operation, e. coli was frequently isolated in the patients without surgery in the patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis without indwelling catheter, while p. aeruginosa was frequently isolated in the patients who underwent surgery in the patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis with indwelling catheter. in uncomplicated utis, isolation frequencies of klebsiella spp., p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis were significant in the patients with surgery. in complicated utis without indwelling catheter, klebsiella spp. was frequently isolated in the patients with surgery. in complicated utis with indwelling catheter, s. aureus and staphylococcus spp. were frequently isolated in the patients without surgery.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2001)].
from october 2001 to september 2002, we collected the specimen from 370 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of the isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 458 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 456 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 69, streptococcus pneumoniae 72, haemophilus influenzae 85, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 44, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 13, klebsiella pneumoniae 32, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 32, and others. of 69 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 43.5%. vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against mrsa as observed in 2000. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) was 59.7% and both rates of pisp and prsp were the highest after 1992. carbapenems had strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially, panipenem and imipenem inhibited the growth of all 72 strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. generally, all drugs had strong activities against h. influenzae with mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or less. the drug that had the strongest activity against h. influenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 80 of the 85 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. against p. aeruginosa mucoid strain, meropenem had a strong activity with mic90 of 0.5 microgram/ml while, against non-mucoid strain, tobramycin had a strong activity with mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and minocycline, and the mic90s were 4 micrograms/ml or less. particularly, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, and imipenem had the strongest activity (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml), and cefozopran had a strong activity, inhibiting the growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/ml. also, all drugs generally had strong activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic90s of all drugs were 4 micrograms/ml or less. the drug that had the strongest activity was minocycline and levofloxacin inhibiting all 32 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (40.5%). as for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 39.2% and 37.3% of all the patients, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (19.3%) and s. pneumoniae (19.9%). in contrast, h. influenzae (22.0%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (20.8%) and h. influenzae (21.5%). s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae decreased after the initiation of drug administration while s. aureus increased. the isolation frequency of p. aeruginosa was higher after than before the initiation of drug administration. the bacteria were frequently isolated from the patients who had already treated with cephems were s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. from the patients who had already treated with macrolides, s. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated while s. aureus was the most frequently isolated from the patients pre-treated with quinolones.
[activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in japan].
a survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 japanese medical institutions in 2000. a total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. a high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecium. isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa from uti accounted for 30-60%. however, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, moraxella catarrhalis, the enterobacteriaceae family, and haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). about 85% of p. aeruginosa isolated from rti were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among mrsa, enterococci, and p. aeruginosa isolated from uti, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and p. aeruginosa from rti as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
effects of low-level laser therapy (lllt) of 810 nm upon in vitro growth of bacteria: relevance of irradiance and radiant exposure.
objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the irradiance-dependency of  low-level laser therapy (lllt) effects on bacterial growth. background: lllt is applied to open wounds to improve healing; however, its effect on wound bacteria is not well understood. materials and methods: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were irradiated using a wavelength of 810 nm at irradiances of 0.015 w/cm2 (0-50 j/cm2) and 0.03 w/cm2 (0-80 j/cm2). bacteria were counted after 20 h of incubation. results: lllt effects varied significantly with species. p.aeruginosa growth decreased overall dependent on an interaction of irradiance and radiant exposure; greatest inhibition was produced using high irradiance delivering radiant exposures in the range of 1-20 j/cm2 (p = 0.001-0.04). in contrast, e. coli growth increased overall (p = 0.01), regardless of irradiance; greatest effects were produced using low radiant exposures (1-20 j/cm2). there was a main effect for irradiance (p = 0.03) on s. aureus growth; however, growth was not different compared with controls. additional analysis showed that there were differences in growth of p.aeruginosa when comparing samples that were matched by exposure times (66, 329, 658, 1316, 1974, and 2632 sec) rather than radiant exposure; this suggests that irradiance rather than exposure time was the significant factor in p. aeruginosa inhibition. conclusion: these findings have immediate relevancy in the use of lllt for infected wounds. exposure to 810-nm irradiation (0.03 w/cm2) could potentially benefit wounds infected with p. aeruginosa. however, increased e. coli growth could further delay recovery.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dk-507k, a novel fluoroquinolone.
the antibacterial activities of dk-507k, a novel quinolone, were compared with those of other quinolones: ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, and garenoxacin (bms284756). dk-507k was as active as sitafloxacin and was as active as or up to eightfold more active than gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and garenoxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. dk-507k was as active as or 4-fold more active than garenoxacin and 2- to 16-fold more active than gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, including clinical isolates and in vitro-selected mutants with known mutations. dk-507k inhibited all ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae at 1 microg/ml. a time-kill assay with s. pneumoniae showed that dk-507k was more bactericidal than gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. the activities of dk-507k against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and equal to or up to 32-fold higher than those of gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and garenoxacin. dk-507k was fourfold less active than sitafloxacin and ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa, while it was two to four times more potent than levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and garenoxacin against p. aeruginosa. in vivo, intravenous treatment with dk-507k was more effective than that with gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against systemic infections caused by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa in mice. in a mouse model of pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, dk-507k administered subcutaneously showed dose-dependent efficacy and eliminated the bacteria from the lungs, whereas gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin had no significant efficacy. oral treatment with dk-507k was slightly more effective than that with ciprofloxacin in a rat model of foreign body-associated urinary tract infection caused by a p. aeruginosa isolate for which the mic of dk-507k was fourfold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. oral administration of dk-507k to rats achieved higher peak concentrations in serum and higher concentrations in cumulative urine than those achieved with ciprofloxacin. these data indicate the potential advantages of dk-507k over other quinolones for the treatment of a wide range of community-acquired infections.
antimicrobial activity of gymnema sylvestre leaf extract.
the ethanolic extract of gymnema sylvestre leaves demonstrated antimicrobial activity against bacillus pumilis, b. subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and inactivity against proteus vulgaris and escherichia coli.
acylation of sc4 dodecapeptide increases bactericidal potency against gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant strains.
we have conjugated dodecyl and octadecyl fatty acids to the n-terminus of sc4, a  potently bactericidal, helix-forming peptide 12-mer (klfkrhlkwkii), and examined the bactericidal activities of the resultant sc4 'peptide-amphiphile' molecules. sc4 peptide-amphiphiles showed up to a 30-fold increase in bactericidal activity against gram-positive strains (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus anthracis), including s. aureus strains resistant to conventional antibiotics, but little or no increase in bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa). fatty acid conjugation improved endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) neutralization by 3- to 6-fold. although acylation somewhat increased lysis of human erythrocytes, it did not increase lysis of endothelial cells, and the haemolytic effects occurred at concentrations 10- to 100-fold higher than those required for bacterial cell lysis. for insight into the mechanism of action of sc4 peptide-amphiphiles, cd, nmr and fluorescence spectroscopy studies were performed in micelle and liposome models of eukaryotic and bacterial cell membranes. cd indicated that sc4 peptide-amphiphiles had the strongest helical tendencies in liposomes mimicking bacterial membranes, and strong membrane integration of the sc4 peptide-amphiphiles was observed using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy under these conditions; results that correlated with the increased bactericidal activities of sc4 peptide-amphiphiles. nmr structural analysis in micelles demonstrated that the two-thirds of the peptide closest to the fatty acid tail exhibited a helical conformation, with the positively-charged side of the amphipathic helix interacting more with the model membrane surface. these results indicate that conjugation of a fatty acid chain to the sc4 peptide enhances membrane interactions, stabilizes helical structure in the membrane-bound state and increases bactericidal potency.
argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
the in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period november 2001-march 2002. out of 418 enterobacteriaceae included in the study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. esbls putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of proteus mirabilis and 25% escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as esbls producers notably p.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for esbl producers. esbls producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. the isolates considered as amp c beta lactamase putative producers showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. noteworthy only 4% of the enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (mic(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against acinetobacter spp (mic(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). only 41.7% acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of haemophilus influenzae isolates (mic(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. the activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as e.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 e.faecium and 1 e.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. all the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed mics of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. among 34 viridans group streptococci only 67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (mic(90) 4 microg/ml).piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial drug to be used, preferably in combination (ie: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in argentina. caution must be taken for infections due to esbl producers considering that the inoculum effect mics can affect mic values.
staphylococcus aureus vaccine conjugate--nabi: nabi-staphvax, staphvax.
staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections and infections in kidney dialysis patients. over 90% of these infections are due to types 5 and 8. nabi, under a crada agreement with the us national institutes of health, is developing a bivalent vaccine against s. aureus types 5 and 8 [nabi-staphvax, staphvax]. the vaccine contains type 5 and type 8 s. aureus capsular polysaccharides conjugated to a protein carrier (recombinant exoprotein a, a genetically detoxified form of pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a). nabi changed its name to nabi biopharmaceuticals on 5 march 2002. staphvax is available for licensing (http://www.nabi.com). nabi's preference is for a licensee that can provide non-us marketing and regulatory capabilities in addition to financial resources to accelerate the vaccine's development. nabi intends to develop a second-generation version of staphvax that will include antigen from staphylococcus type 336. this would increase the vaccine's coverage of staphylococcal infection. nabi also intends to develop two combination vaccines. the first, staphvax+ will contain both staphvax and epivax trade mark in a single vial and the second, combivax, will contain components of staphvax, epivax trade mark and enterovax trade mark. the vaccine has completed phase ii clinical trials in chronic, ambulatory, peritoneal dialysis patients. nabi-staphvax completed a multicentre, phase iii trial in the us involving 1800 end-stage renal disease patients on haemodialysis. in september 2000, nabi announced preliminary results from the phase iii trial; these indicated that although nabi-staphvax elicited a significant decrease in s. aureus bacteraemias in the first 10 months after vaccination, statistical significance was not reached in the primary endpoint of the study, a decrease after 1-year follow up. as a result, the us fda indicated that us registration would require a second phase iii trial in which the primary endpoint is reached. following discussions with the us fda, nabi stated that the initiation of a second phase iii trial in collaboration with a corporate partner was likely. nabi intends to request either an accelerated- or fast-track review by the fda, on the basis that the vaccine prevents a fatal disease for which no other prophylactics are available. in the meantime, nabi initiated a boosting study of nabi-staphvax in july 2001. this trial is administering a second dose of nabi-staphvax to 100 patients enrolled in the phase iii trial. nabi plans to begin the confirmatory phase iii study of the vaccine, as requested by the us fda, in 3000 end-stage kidney patients in q4 2003. the primary endpoint will be a statistically significant reduction of s. aureus bacteraemia caused by type 5 and 8 s. aureus through 8 months post-vaccination, the peak efficacy point in the first phase iii trial. this trial will include a booster vaccination at 8 months and vaccinees will be followed up for up to 6 months after the booster to evaluate the vaccine's ability to generate antibodies, efficacy and safety. results from this study will be used to support eventual product registration, now planned for 2005. in july 2003, nabi reported that proceeds totalling 32.9 million us dollars from the private placement of its common stock to selected investors will enable the planned confirmatory phase iii trial to proceed. in june 2003, nabi biopharmaceuticals announced the start of a clinical trial (a bridging study) to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a newly manufactured lot of staphvax produced by the contract manufacturer, dow biopharmaceutical contract manufacturing, intended for use in a planned confirmatory phase iii trial later in 2003. the study demonstrated that the new batch of vaccine generated antibody levels that were equivalent to the levels generated by the vaccine produced at nabi's r&d pilot plant and used in previous phase iii studies.
relevance of soft-tissue penetration by levofloxacin for target site bacterial killing in patients with sepsis.
antimicrobial therapy of soft tissue infections in patients with sepsis sometimes lacks efficiency, despite the documented susceptibility of the causative pathogen to the administered antibiotic. in this context, impaired equilibration between the antibiotic concentrations in plasma and those in tissues in critically ill patients has been discussed. to characterize the impact of tissue penetration of anti-infective agents on antimicrobial killing, we used microdialysis to measure the concentration-versus-time profiles of levofloxacin in the interstitial space fluid of skeletal muscle in patients with sepsis. subsequently, we applied an established dynamic in vivo pharmacokinetic-in vitro pharmacodynamic approach to simulate bacterial killing at the site of infection. the population mean areas under the concentration-time curves (aucs) for levofloxacin showed that levofloxacin excellently penetrates soft tissues, as indicated by the ratio of the auc from time zero to 8 h (auc(0-8)) for muscle tissue (auc(0-8 muscle)) to the auc(0-8) for free drug in plasma (auc(0-8 plasma free)) (auc(0-8 muscle)/auc(0-8 plasma free) ratio) of 0.85. the individual values of tissue penetration and maximum concentration (c(max)) in muscle tissue were highly variable. no difference in bacterial killing of a select staphylococcus aureus strain for which the mic was 0.5 microg/ml was found between individuals after exposure to dynamically changing concentrations of levofloxacin in plasma and tissue in vitro. in contrast, the decrease in the bacterial counts of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic = 2 microg/ml) varied extensively when the bacteria were exposed to levofloxacin at the concentrations determined from the individual concentration-versus-time profiles obtained in skeletal muscle. the extent of bacterial killing could be predicted by calculating individual c(max)/mic and auc(0-8 muscle)/auc(0-8 plasma free) ratios (r = 0.96 and 0.93, respectively). we have therefore shown in the present study that individual differences in the tissue penetration of levofloxacin may markedly affect target site killing of bacteria for which mics are close to 2 microg/ml.
susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
the aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. we created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 january, 1990 through 31 december, 2000). improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. during the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). the mean annual number of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). the 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: escherichia coli (1494), staphylococcus aureus (1240), klebsiella pneumoniae (779), enterococcus spp. (631), pseudomonas aeruginosa (488), streptococcus pneumoniae (447), enterobacter spp. (338), acinetobacter spp. (298), proteus mirabilis (260) and candida spp. (254). no significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations) per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was e. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was candida (1, 0.3). forty percent of organisms (n=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ed), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (icus). trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ed enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the icu isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. the difference in susceptibility between ed and icu isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (p<0.001). a significant decrease in the susceptibility of e coli to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. in k. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of k. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. susceptibility of s. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (p<0.001). marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.
antimicrobial activity of some 2- and 3-pyridinyl-1h-benzimidazoles and their feiii, cuii, znii, and agi complexes.
2-(2-pyridinyl)- (li), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)- (lii), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-(liii), 2-(3-pyridinyl)- (liv), 2-(3-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-1h-benzimidazoles (lv) and their complexes with fe(no3)3, cu(no3)2, zn(no3)2, and agno3 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans. the methyl groups of liii increase the antimicrobial activity. the agi complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. some znii complexes show an antimicrobial effect against s. aureus and s. flexneri, although the ligands themselves have no effect. cuii complexes have a considerable antibacterial effect to s. aureus and s. epidermidis.
the biological activity of antibacterial substance produced by enterobacter cloacae b8.
an antibacterial substance was extracted and purified from the culture of enterobacter cloacae b8 and the antagonistic activities of the extract to 229 clinical pathogen strains was tested by the k-b paper-dish method. the extract of enterobacter cloacae b8 showed strongly antagonistic activity to all 146 tested stains of staphylococcus spp.; the antagonistic diameter was about 18-32 mm, averaging about 26.5 mm; showing especially strong antagonistic activity to all 87 tested strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the average antagonistic diameter was about 22.6 mm. the average antagonistic diameter of the extract of enterobacter cloacae b8 to 3 tested strains of escherchia coli and 8 tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae was about 14 mm and 13 mm, respectively; showing only antagonistic activities to 3 strains of acinetobacter spp. in 26 tested strains, and showing no antagonistic activities to all 25 tested strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of partially purified extract against mrsa was about 9.4 micrograms/ml determined by disc-diffusion method, and the mic of vancomycin was about 3.1 micrograms/ml as the control in this study.
inflammatory and microbiologic markers in induced sputum after intravenous antibiotics in cystic fibrosis.
induced sputum has been used to study airway inflammation. we sought to determine whether markers of infection and inflammation in induced sputum were a useful and safe outcome measure in cystic fibrosis. we hypothesized that bacterial density and inflammatory content of induced sputum would decrease after antibiotic therapy. induced sputum was assayed for bacterial density, cell count, and differential and inflammatory markers before and after treatment with intravenous antibiotics. fifty-five of the 72 subjects enrolled (mean age +/- sd 18.2 +/- 7.9 years) completed the study. fev1 increased by an average 0.3 +/- 0.3 l (10.4 +/- 8.7% predicted fev1), p<0.0001; density of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus decreased by 2.4 +/- 3.1 log10 cfu/g (p<0.0005) and 4.0 +/- 2.3 log10 cfu/ml (p<0.0001), respectively; neutrophil count decreased by 0.4 +/- 0.6 log10 cells/ml (p<0.0001), interleukin-8 concentration by 0.5 +/- 1.3 log10 pg/ml (p<0.05), and neutrophil elastase by 0.4 +/- 0.7 log10 microg/ml (p<0.005). seven of 127 (6%) sputum induction procedures showed a decrease in fev1 of 20% or more. we conclude that markers in induced sputum may be useful, noninvasive outcome measures to assess response to therapies in cystic fibrosis studies.
contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the united states.
grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. a total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae (mic(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). for pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (mic(90), 2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (mic(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. none of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same mic(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae. grepafloxacin was very active against haemophilus influenzae (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and legionella spp. (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). these results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.
composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils from invasive species of the azores, hedychium gardnerianum and pittosporum undulatum.
the compositions of the essential oils from the leaves and flowers of hedychium gardnerianum and from the leaves of pittosporum undulatum growing on san miguel island (azores) were investigated, and the compounds were identified by gc-ms analyses. the oils in the leaves and flowers of h. gardnerianum were rich in alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and alpha-cadinol, whereas that from p. undulatum was found to contain monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and alkanes, of which the sesquiterpenes, calamenene (41.4%), farnesol (10.9%), spathulenol (5.6%) and beta-selinene (5.2%) and the diterpene (8beta,13beta)-kaur-16-ene (10.7%) were the major components. their potential antimicrobial activities were tested against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and those with the highest activities against s. aureus and s. epidermis were from h. gardnerianum; none had activity against p. aeruginosa. additionally, the essential oils from pittosporum undulatum had good antithrombin activity whereas that from h. gardnerianum did not.
antimicrobial characterization of human beta-defensin 3 derivatives.
human beta-defensin 3 (hbd3) is a highly basic 45-amino-acid protein that acts both as an antimicrobial agent and as a chemoattractant molecule. although the nature of its antimicrobial activity is largely electrostatic, the importance of the molecular structure on this activity is poorly understood. two isoforms of hbd3 were synthesized: the first with native disulfide linkages and the second with nonnative linkages. in a third synthetic peptide, all cysteine residues were replaced with alpha-aminobutyric acid, creating a completely linear peptide. a series of six small, linear peptides corresponding to regions of hbd3 with net charges ranging from +4 to +8 (at ph 7) and lengths ranging from 9 to 20 amino acids were also synthesized. the linear full-length peptide showed the highest microbicidal activity against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, while all three full-length forms showed equal activity against candida albicans. the linear peptide also showed high activity against enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. peptides corresponding to the c terminus showed higher activities when tested against e. coli, with the most active peptides being the most basic. however, only the peptide corresponding to the n terminus of hbd3 showed any activity against s. aureus and c. albicans. further, n-terminal deletion mutants of native hbd3 showed diminished activities against s. aureus. thus, the antimicrobial properties of hbd3 derivatives are determined by both charge and structure.
comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.
ropivacaine 0.1% with sufentanil 1 microg/ml inhibits in vitro growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa and does not promote multiplication of staphylococcus aureus.
we investigated the effect of ropivacaine combined with sufentanil, a mixture frequently used for postoperative epidural analgesia, on the growth of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa at room temperature. aliquots of suspension of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa in saline were transferred into test tubes containing either a mixture of ropivacaine 0.1% and sufentanil 1 microg/ml (r+s) or saline (sa), with the latter serving as control. at 0, 3, 6, 24, and 48 h after inoculation, 1 ml of each solution was spread over standard blood agar. the plates were incubated at 22 degrees c for 48 h, and the numbers of colony-forming units (cfu) were counted. the growth ratio for both bacterial strains was calculated as cfu time (t(n))/cfu baseline (t(0)). the primary efficacy variable was the area under the curve (auc) in (cfu t(n)/cfu t(0)) x time, based on the growth ratios. the auc for p. aeruginosa was significantly less in r+s than in sa (p = 0.028). multiplication of p. aeruginosa (growth ratio >1) was observed for at least 6 h after inoculation in sa. growth of p. aeruginosa was significantly less in r+s than in sa at 3 h (p = 0.043) and 24 h (p = 0.012) after inoculation. the auc for s. aureus did not differ significantly between r+s and sa (p = 0.74). neither r+s nor sa promoted multiplication of s. aureus. forty-eight hours after inoculation, growth of s. aureus was significantly less in r+s than in sa (p < 0.0001). we conclude that r+s inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa and did not promote multiplication of s. aureus when compared with sa. implications: this laboratory study demonstrated that compared with saline, ropivacaine 0.1% with 1 microg/ml of sufentanil inhibited growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa and did not promote multiplication of staphylococcus aureus at room temperature. with respect to bacterial infection with these two strains, the mixture seems to be safe for continuous epidural administration if prepared under aseptic conditions and after alcohol hand rub.
antimicrobial activity and interference of tobramycin and chloramphenicol on bacterial adhesion to intraocular lenses.
the antimicrobial activities of tobramycin and chloramphenicol were evaluated by  determining minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, group a, group b and group g streptococci, klebsiella spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ciprofloxacin-resistant and -susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as by evaluating interference on adhesion of slime producer strains of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa to intraocular lens from tobramycin and chloramphenicol pharmaceutical products by scanning electron microscopy. chloramphenicol was more active against gram-positive bacteria than was tobramycin, which instead showed higher activity against ciprofloxacin-susceptible p. aeruginosa. treatment of lenses with the antimicrobial products eradicated the bacterial biofilm, which was already notably reduced after 5 min. this activity was more pronounced for chloramphenicol against s. aureus and for tobramycin against p. aeruginosa. bacterial adhesion was also significantly reduced when lenses colonized by p. aeruginosa were treated with chloramphenicol, even if they were resistant to this drug. in conclusion, the tested drugs showed marked antibacterial activity, particularly by interfering with bacterial biofilms. the data obtained in this study suggest a specific use of chloramphenicol in topical prophylaxis aimed at avoiding bacterial contaminations. however, further specific in vivo studies are needed to confirm these data.
in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.
a practical guide to the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections.
complicated skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) remain a common reason for hospitalisation. optimal management of complicated sstis begins with a physical examination, and obtaining the complete social and medical history of the patient. empirical intravenous antibacterial therapy is guided by expected pathogens, patient factors and diagnostic procedure reports, such as the gram-stained smear of discharge or exudates. the majority of community-acquired sstis are caused by staphylococcus aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci. on the basis of recent surveillance data, 80-90% of these pathogens remain susceptible to cefazolin or oxacillin. consequently, a first generation cephalosporin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin remains the first line empirical therapy for community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections. vancomycin may be an appropriate alternative when vancomycin-resistant s. aureus is highly suspected on the basis of patient history and co-morbid conditions. with the global emergence and spread of macrolide-resistant s. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci, clindamycin rather than a macrolide is the recommended agent for empirical antibacterial therapy of community-acquired sstis in penicillin-allergic patients. nosocomial complicated sstis are predominantly caused by s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae. piperacillin/tazobactam with or without vancomycin is the preferred agent for empirical treatment depending on local resistance statistics. the newer fluoroquinolones may have a role in the treatment of complicated sstis, especially in penicillin-allergic patients. more clinical studies are needed before a formal recommendation can be made. many of the newer antimicrobial agents such as the carbapenems, oxazolidinones and streptogramins have been shown to be effective for the treatment of complicated sstis. however, because of their proven activity against highly resistant organisms including methicillin-resistant s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (oxazolidinones and streptogramins), and gram-negative bacilli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (carbapenems), these antibacterials should be reserved for life-threatening situations and/or when resistant pathogens are suspected. complicated skin and soft tissue infections are often associated with exudates, ulcerations, fluid collections or abscesses. adequate debridement of devitalized tissues and drainage of abscesses and fluid collections in addition to systemic antibacterial therapy is an integral part of appropriate management.
an assessment of two carpobrotus species extracts as potential antimicrobial agents.
for centuries, indigenous people in south africa have used a variety of medicinal herbs to treat chronic infections. this investigation focused on two carpobrotus species belonging to the family, aizoaceae, in an attempt to assess their antimicrobial potential. extracts of varying polarities of the plants were prepared and tested against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and mycobacterium smegmatis. for the disc diffusion method, ciprofloxacin (40 microg/disc) served as positive control for s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and m. smegmatis, whereas amphotericin b (25 microg/disc) was the control for c. albicans. a sample concentration of 10 mg/ml was used. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by two-fold serial dilution. phytochemical analysis was completed to test for the presence of flavonoids, hydrolysable tannins, phytosterols and aromatic acids. the ethyl acetate extracts (21 microl of 95 mg/ml) were used for bio-autography, together with tlc analyses. carpobrotus muirii and carpobrotus quadrifidus showed antimicrobial activity against s. aureus and m. smegmatis in the disc diffusion method and inhibition against s. aureus and m. smegmatis was observed by clear zones on the tlc plate. this investigation confirms that extracts of these carpobrotus species that are used as indigenous medicines, exhibit anti-bacterial activity. this scientific information can serve as an important platform for the development of inexpensive, safe and effective natural anti-infective medicines.
target site bacterial killing of cefpirome and fosfomycin in critically ill patients.
we employed an in-vivo pharmacokinetic/in-vitro pharmacodynamic method to simulate bacterial killing in plasma and the interstitium of skeletal muscle tissue after intravenous administration of 2 g of cefpirome and 8 g of fosfomycin alone and in combination to patients with sepsis. interstitial antimicrobial concentrations were determined by use of in-vivo microdialysis. cfu/ml of staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (clinical isolate) decreased by approximately 2log(10) for plasma and muscle tissue 6 h after cefpirome and fosfomycin administration compared with the baseline, respectively. the simulation of plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics for the combined administration of these antibiotics resulted in complete eradication of s. aureus within 5 h after drug exposure. no bacterial re-growth occurred in any of the simulations within 6 h. the in-vitro simulation of in-vivo plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics of cefpirome and fosfomycin has shown that both antimicrobial agents kill s. aureus and p. aeruginosa strains effectively after single dose administration. this effect was most pronounced by the combined use of these antimicrobial agents. therefore, this data corroborates antimicrobial strategies of simultaneous administration of cefpirome and fosfomycin in patients with severe soft tissue infection.
synthesis, antibacterial and antifungal activities of electron-rich olefins derived benzimidazole compounds.
new benzimidazole derivatives were synthesised by electron-rich olefines (7, 8 and 9) with appropriate reagents. the compounds synthesised were identified by 1h nmr, 13c nmr, ft-ir spectroscopic techniques and elemental analysis. all compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains: enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853) and the yeasts candida albicans and candida tropicalis. eleven of the compounds inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis and s. aureus) at mic values between 50 and 400 microg/ml. none of the compounds exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (e. coli and p. aeruginosa) at the concentrations studied (6.25-800 microg/ml). nine of the tested compounds showed an antifungal activity with a range of the mics between 50 and 400 microg/ml.
in vitro antibacterial activity of a 7-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-nutanocoumarin from chaptalia nutans (asteraceae).
ethanolic crude extracts from the roots of chaptalia nutans, traditionally used in brazilian folk medicine, were screened against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa by using the disk diffusion test technique. s. aureus with 14 mm inhibition zone was considered susceptible. e. coli and p. aeruginosa without such a zone were considered resistant. as a result of this finding, the ethanolic crude extract was fractionated on silica gel column chromatography into five fractions. the ethyl acetate fraction was active against s. aureus and bacillus subtilis. further column chromatography separation of the ethyl acetate fraction afforded 30 fractions, which were assayed against s. aureus. fractions 16 and 17 showed inhibition zones with s. aureus, indicating the presence of active compounds, and were subjected to purification by repeated preparative thin layer chromatography. the pure compound 7-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-nutanocoumarin inhibited b. subtilis and s. aureus at concentrations of 62.5 g/ml and 125 g/ml, respectively. the antibacterial property of c. nutans appears to have justified its use for the treatment of wounds, which are contaminated through bacterial infections.
[cefepime (maxipime), large spectrum 4th generation cephalosporin, resistant to beta-lactamases].
as a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; activity against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter and klebsiella species; low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. its spectrum is very large being very active against gram-negative bacilii: enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, citrobacter, proteus mirabilis and less active against bacillus fragillis. cefepime is also very active against gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes. some of the methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; enterococcus is resistant. due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases cefepime (maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.
comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
in vitro activity of gatifloxacin alone and in combination with cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin and gentamicin against multidrug-resistant organisms.
objectives: to study the in vitro interaction of gatifloxacin in combination with gentamicin and with the beta-lactams cefepime, meropenem and piperacillin against clinical isolates of stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). methods: the activity of each drug alone was determined by an agar dilution method. chequerboard synergy testing was then performed against all the isolates. time-kill assays were done on selected isolates to assess correlation with the chequerboard results. results: synergy was demonstrated with the following combinations at achievable serum concentrations: gatifloxacin/piperacillin for 80% and gatifloxacin/cefepime for 60% of s. maltophilia; gatifloxacin/gentamicin for 60%, and gatifloxacin/cefepime for 50% of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, and in all drug combinations for 50-70% of p. aeruginosa. indifference was noted for the majority of b. cepacia and vre isolates. antagonism at therapeutic serum levels was observed with gatifloxacin/piperacillin against a single isolate of b. cepacia. no distinct trend in drug interaction was seen with the different drug combinations against mrsa. time-kill analyses against selected isolates confirmed the synergic activity of the following drug combinations seen in the chequerboard assays: gatifloxacin/cefepime and gatifloxacin/piperacillin against p. aeruginosa, gatifloxacin/gentamicin against b. cepacia, and gatifloxacin/gentamicin and gatifloxacin/meropenem against esbl-producing k. pneumoniae. conclusions: gatifloxacin was synergic with the beta-lactams piperacillin, cefepime and meropenem, and with gentamicin against some drug-resistant pathogens. some of the time-kill analyses against p. aeruginosa, b. cepacia and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae were in accordance with chequerboard results. time-kill analyses against s. maltophilia did not confirm the synergy seen in chequerboard testing.
in vitro antibacterial activity of omani and african honey.
the study aims to investigate the antibacterial activity of honey obtained from different parts of oman and compare it with that of honey obtained from elsewhere in africa. a total of 24 honey samples (16 from different parts of oman and eight from elsewhere in africa) were investigated for their antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus (nctc 6571), escherichia coli (nctc 10418) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (nctc 10662) using standard antimicrobial assays. marked variations in the antibacterial activity of the different honey samples were observed. fourteen of the 16 omani samples and five of the eight african samples showed antibacterial activity ranked as either fair, good or excellent to at least one of the three bacterial strains tested. both omani and african honeys possess in vitro antibacterial activity against the three bacterial strains tested, with 25% of the samples showing excellent antibacterial activity.
analysis of sequential aliquots of hypertonic saline solution-induced sputum from clinically stable patients with cystic fibrosis.
study objectives: sputum induction (si) is a noninvasive tool for sampling inflamed airways. the purpose of this study was to determine the optimal duration of collection in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). the hypothesis was that the duration of si collection would quantitatively and qualitatively alter the content of the induced sputum. methods: in 10 clinically stable patients with cf (mean +/- sd age, 28 +/- 7 years; mean fev(1), 2.6 +/- 0.7 l), si was performed with 3% hypertonic saline solution at five time points over 20 min. results: si was well tolerated, with an average maximum fall in fev(1) of 7 +/- 7%. the sample volumes, urea concentrations, interleukin-8 concentrations, total cell counts, and nonsquamous cell counts remained constant (p > 0.05). the percentage of neutrophils decreased from 89 +/- 5% to 86 +/- 4% (p = 0.03), and the percentage of alveolar macrophages increased 5 +/- 2% to 8 +/- 4% (p < 0.01). the mean quantitative microbiological counts of nonmucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus decreased over the 20-min time period each by half a log (p = 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). surfactant protein-a concentration increased from 1.6 +/- 0.3 to 2.4 +/- 0.4 ng/ml (log(10); p < 0.001). conclusions: we conclude that aliquots of induced sputum are similar in clinically stable patients with cf during 4-min intervals, although there is more alveolar sampling after 20 min. when induced-sputum samples are fractionated for research monitoring of inflammatory or microbiologic indexes, power calculations accounting for these variations over time are required.
in vitro activity of s-3578, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
the in vitro antibacterial activity of s-3578, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against clinical isolates was evaluated. the mics of the drug at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 4 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and 2 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, which were fourfold higher than and equal to those of vancomycin, respectively. the anti-mrsa activity of s-3578 was considered to be due to its high affinity for penicillin-binding protein 2a (50% inhibitory concentration, 4.5 micro g/ml). in time-kill studies with 10 strains each of mrsa and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, s-3578 caused more than a 4-log(10) decrease of viable cells on the average at twice the mic after 24 h of exposure, indicating that it had potent bactericidal activity. furthermore, in population analysis of mrsa strains with heterogeneous or homogeneous resistance to imipenem, no colonies emerged from about 10(9) cells on agar plates containing twice the mic of s-3578, suggesting the low frequency of emergence of s-3578-resistant strains from mrsa. s-3578 was also highly active against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), with a mic(90) of 1 micro g/ml, which was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. s-3578 also had antibacterial activity against a variety of gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa, though its activity was not superior to that of cefepime. in conclusion, s-3578 exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum and, particularly, had excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and prsp. thus, s-3578 was considered to be worthy of further evaluation.
[pathogen variance and drug-sensibility analysis of lower-respiratory-tract bacterial infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease].
we contrastively analyzed pathogens and their drug sensibilities of lower-respiratory-tract infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease in two different periods. the results were that the gram-positive cocci (gpc) was 43.8% and gram-negative bacilli (gnb) was 56.2% in group a (1985-1990); gpc was 24.6% and gnb was 75.4% in group b (1995-2000). the predominant bacteria were in the following order: preudomonas (21.9%), pneumococcal (18.8%), streptococcus (10.9%), acinetobacter (9.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), and klebsiella (7.8%) in group a; and preudomonas (30.7%), acinetobacter (12.3%), staphylococcus epidermidis (12.3%), klebsiella (10.5%), enteric bacilli (7.0%), and staphylococcus aureus (7.0%) in group b. the results suggest that gnb is the main pathogen in recent years; sensibility of most drugs in the 1990s fell in varying degrees compared with that in the 1980s, but antibacterial in common use is still available.
[isolation, purification and antibacterial activities of salivary histidine-rich  polypeptides].
objective: to isolate and purify salivary histidine-rich-polypeptides (hrps) and  observe their antibacterial activities. methods: by using of preparative acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (au-page), three major hrps(hrp-1, hrp-3 and hrp-5) were purified from parotid saliva collected from healthy adults. their antibacterial activities were tested in the ultrasensitive antibacterial assay, named radial diffusion assay. results: each fraction of the three purified hrps appeared as a single protein zone both in au-page and tricine-sds-page. their molecular weights are 3-5 kd as determined by tricine-sds-page. all the three major hrps showed potent bactericidal effects on streptococcus mutans mt6r and staphylococcus aureas atcc25923. as to escherichia coli ml-35p and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853, hrp-3 and hrp-5 also demonstrated significant antibacterial activities, whereas hrp-1 did not show any inhibitory effects on the viability of them. conclusion: the above results suggested that the method of preparative au-page we used in this study has the benefits of high resolution, simple manipulation and perfect results of purification. hrps are important components to prevent oral tissue from bacterial infections, therefore play a potent role in the maintenance of the oral health.
[comparative studies on activities on antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
the bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied between august 2000 and july 2001. then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined, and the results were compared with those obtained between 1992 and 1999. comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those in uncomplicated utis and those in complicated utis (including with or without indwelling catheter). e. faecalis showed good susceptibility to ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm), and the mic90s were 2 micrograms/ml. also, e. faecalis showed good susceptibility to vancomycin (vcm). however, the mic90, which was 2 micrograms/ml between 1992 and 1999, rose to 4 micrograms/ml in patients with complicated utis because the strains inhibited at 4 micrograms/ml increased more than before. the low susceptibility of s. aureus to arbekacin (abk) in complicated utis, as shown in 1998 and 1999, recovered in 2000, and no strains inhibited at > or = 4 micrograms/ml were detected. e. coli showed good susceptibility to ctm (mic90: 0.25-0.5 microgram/ml) and czop (mic90: < or = 0.125 microgram/ml) and was not resistant to those. e. coli also showed good susceptibility to the other drugs except to penicillins. decreases in susceptibility of e. coli to quinolones, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and sparfloxacin (spfx) were observed in the patients with complicated utis. the susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to all drugs did not significantly change in 2000 and was generally good except to penicillins. although the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to carbapenems was notable, the mic90 went up from 4 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in complicated utis compared with those observed in the previous year.
unsymmetrical 1,1'-disubstituted ferrocenes: synthesis of co(ii), cu(ii), ni(ii)  and zn(ii) chelates of ferrocenyl -1-thiadiazolo-1'-tetrazole, -1-thiadiazolo-1'-triazole and -1-tetrazolo-1'-triazole with antimicrobial properties.
condensation reactions of 1,1''-diacetylferrocene with different heteroaromatic amines such as, 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole, 5-aminotetrazole and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to form unsymmetrically 1,1'-disubstituted ferrocenes have been studied. the obtained compounds have been further investigated for their liganding and biological properties upon chelation with co(ii), cu(ii), ni(ii) and zn(ii) metal ions. the synthesized compounds have been characterized by physical, spectral and analytical data and have been screened against pathogenic bacterial strains e.g., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, showing moderate activity as antibacterials in vitro.
prevalence and drug susceptibility of pathogens causing bloodstream infections in northern italy: a two-year study in 16 hospitals.
the epidemiology of bacterial pathogens causing bloodstream infection was studied in 16 hospitals in lombardy (northern italy) over a 2-year period (1999 and 2000). overall, 2924 microorganisms causing significant bacteremia were collected. the most frequent isolates were escherichia coli ( n=663; 22.7%), staphylococcus aureus ( n=534; 18.3%), staphylococcus epidermidis ( n=242; 8.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa ( n=176; 6.0%). unlike escherichia coli, which was usually acquired from the community, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were usually acquired in hospitals. rates of resistance to oxacillin and its associated traits were significantly higher among hospital-acquired staphylococci as compared to those of isolates from the community. escherichia coli was highly susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, with a very low percentage of strains producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (esbls). on the contrary, production of esbl appeared to be an important mechanism of resistance among nosocomial isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae. resistance to ciprofloxacin was widespread in several members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with rates often exceeding 10%. moreover, with regard to ciprofloxacin, there were no significant differences between rates of resistance among enterobacteriaceae causing hospital-acquired infections versus those causing community-acquired infections. multidrug resistance was commonly observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the need for new antimicrobial agents that are more active against nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria. in conclusion, epidemiological studies of the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of blood isolates in northern italy appear to provide useful information for both empirical treatment of suspected infections and better management of patients.
keratinocyte expression of human beta defensin 2 following bacterial infection: role in cutaneous host defense.
human beta defensin 2 (hbetad-2) is thought to play an important role in cutaneous immune defense. we hypothesized that (i) keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2, measured by reverse transcription-pcr, would be upregulated in response to challenge with pathogenic bacteria, particularly highly adherent strains of streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) hbetad-2 would have potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic but not commensal organisms. expression of hbetad-2 was induced consistently by s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas strains of s. pyogenes were poor and variable inducers of hbetad-2. no correlation was found between levels of bacterial adherence and keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2. s. pyogenes was significantly more sensitive to killing by hbetad-2 than s. epidermidis. we conclude that the ability to induce hbetad-2 expression in combination with sensitivity to its antimicrobial effects may contribute to the rarity of skin infections with the gram-negative bacterial organisms, whereas lack of stimulation of hbetad-2 expression by s. pyogenes may be important in its ability to evade innate defenses and cause skin disease. induction of expression of hbetad-2 but relative tolerance to it may enable s. epidermidis to survive on the skin surface and modulate hbetad-2 expression when the stratum corneum barrier is disrupted.
antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of some essential oils.
in this study the composition and antimicrobial properties of essential oils obtained from origanum onites, mentha piperita, juniperus exalsa, chrysanthemum indicum, lavandula hybrida, rosa damascena, echinophora tenuifolia, foeniculum vulgare were examined. to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activities of these eight aromatic extracts; their in vitro antimicrobial activities were determined by disk diffusion testing, according to the nccls criteria. escherichia coli (attc 25922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (attc 27853 were used as standard test bacterial strains. origanum onites recorded antimicrobial activity against all test bacteria, and was strongest against staphylococcus aureus. for rosa damascena, mentha piperita and lavandula hybrida antimicrobial activity was recorded only to staphylococcus aureus. juniperus exalsa, and chrysanthemum indicum exhibited antibacterial activities against both staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. we also examined the in vitro antimicrobial activities of some components of the essential oils and found some components with antimicrobial activity.
antimicrobial studies on methanol extract of benincasa hispida cogn., fruit.
the methanol extract of wax gourd, the fruits of benincasa hispida cogn.(cucurbitaceae) was found to show no inhibition against three gram positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus subtilis and three gram negative bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia by cup-plate method whereas antifungal studies showed significant inhibition against candida albicans in the concentration of 30 mg/ml and there was no inhibition against aspergillus niger.
antimicrobial activity of feiii, cuii, agi, znii and hgii complexes of 2-(2-hydroxy-5-bromo/nitro-phenyl)-1h- and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl/chloro/nitro-1h-benzimidazoles.
antimicrobial activity of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-r5-1h-benzimidazoles, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-r5'-phenyl)-1h-benzimidazoles and their feiii, cuii, agi, znii and hgii nitrate complexes was tested toward staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, and proteus mirabilis. antifungal activity was tested against candida albicans. benzimidazole benzene ring substituents increase the antimicrobial activity, phenol ring substituents decrease it. the ligands show an antibacterial effect against only s. aureus whereas agi and hgii complexes of the ligands have a higher activity with respect to the other complexes to all the bacteria. on the other hand, feiii complexes show a considerable activity against s. aureus and s. epidermidis.
eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.
this study focused on the role of eggshell matrix proteins as a function of potential natural antimicrobial defenses of avian eggs. the electrophoretic profile of sds-page showed that the soluble eggshell matrix proteins had three major bands of 15 000, 36 000, and 66 000 and several minor bands comprising 17 000, 25 000, 30 000, and 75 000, while insoluble matrix proteins were consisting of various bands comprising at least 16 distinct migration bands between 10 000 and 200 000. three bacteria species, pseudomonas aureginosa, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus, were found to be inhibited in the presence of soluble eggshell matrix proteins (100 microg/ml). on the other hand, escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis were weakly inhibited at only an early stage of incubation time (up to 4 h). scanning electron microscopy revealed that eggshell matrix proteins might interact and disrupt the membrane integrity of bacteria. the present study clearly indicated that avian eggshell matrix proteins possess a potential of novel antimicrobial defensin mechanism.
respiratory tract pathogens isolated from patients hospitalized with suspected pneumonia in latin america: frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility profile: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
in spite of the recent medical advances, lower respiratory tract infections are still the most frequent infectious causes of mortality worldwide. the objective of this study was to determine the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates collected from hospitalized patients with pneumonia in latin american medical centers during the first four years of the sentry program. the five most frequently isolated species were (n/%): pseudomonas aeruginosa (659/26.3%), staphylococcus aureus (582/23.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (255/10.2%), acinetobacter spp. (239/9.6%), and enterobacter spp. (134/5.4%). p. aeruginosa demonstrated high rates of resistance to most of the antimicrobials tested. against p. aeruginosa, the most active agents were meropenem (mic(50), 1 microg/ml; 71.6% susceptible), amikacin (mic(50), 4 microg/ml; 71.0% susceptible), and piperacillin/tazobactam (mic(50), 16 microg/ml; 70.4% susceptible). imipenem (mic(50), 1 microg/ml; 84.1% susceptible) and meropenem (mic(50), 2 microg/ml; 84.9% susceptible) were the most active agents against acinetobacter spp. followed by tetracycline (mic(50), </=4 microg/ml; 52.3% susceptible). although the broad-spectrum cephalosporins had demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (mic(50)s range, </= 0.12 to 0.25 microg/ml), elevated rates of resistance (46.3%-58.5%) were observed. approximately 44.0% and 29.0% of k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates were considered esbl producers based on nccls criteria, respectively. overall, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus was 46.2%. the most active drugs against this pathogen were vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. in summary, the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program has detected a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and multidrug resistant non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli isolated from respiratory tract specimens of hospitalized patients with pneumonia in latin america. our results emphasize the importance of local surveillance programs in correctly guiding empiric therapy and local intervention programs in attempt to reduce antimicrobial resistance.
skin and soft tissue infections in latin american medical centers: four-year assessment of the pathogen frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.
we report the results of pathogen frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates collected from skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) in latin american medical centers during the first 4 years (1997-2000) of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. ten laboratories participated each year distributed among nine cities in six countries. a total of 1,789 bacterial isolates were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution at the coordinating central laboratory. results from isolates collected during the year 2000 were compared with those from isolates collected during the prior three years. selected carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa were genotyped by automated ribotyping to evaluate the occurrence of clonal, epidemic dissemination. the five most frequently isolated species were (n/%): staphylococcus aureus (584/32.8%), escherichia coli (233/13.1%), p. aeruginosa (211/11.9%), enterococcus spp. (137/7.7%), and klebsiella spp. (127/5.8%). the most problematic antimicrobial resistances were related to the high prevalence of multi-drug resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacilli. carbapenem resistance among non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli was much higher than that reported in other regions evaluated in the sentry program. only 74.9% of p. aeruginosa and 84.9% of acinetobacter spp. were considered susceptible to imipenem. the antimicrobial susceptibility rates of p. aeruginosa decreased during the study period for most antimicrobial agents evaluated. more than 40% of k. pneumoniae and nearly 10% of e. coli showed an extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype. only 73.4% of e. coli and 76.0% of enterobacter spp. were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. the molecular typing of carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa demonstrated clonal dissemination in two institutions. these reported results indicate that rates of resistance among isolates causing ssti continue to raise in latin america, with specific concerns for the high prevalence of mdr gram-negative bacilli. national and international surveillance programs as a guide to focusing intervention strategies should assist in the control of escalating antimicrobial resistance in this geographic area.
total synthesis and biological evaluation of (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid, an inhibitor of human topoisomerase i.
the naturally occurring (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid was synthesized stereochemically pure in six steps starting with commercially available 1,5-hexadiyne. the title compound was antimicrobial against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus (mic 80 microm) and streptococcus faecalis (mic 200 microm), but inactive against gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, the (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid completely inhibits human topoisomerase i at a concentration of 800 microm, while 5,9-hexadecadiynoic acid and hexadecanoic acid do not inhibit topoisomerase i (>1000 microm). this comparison reveals that the cis double bond geometry in the title compound is required for topoisomerase i inhibition. moreover, these results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid against either s. aureus or s. faecalis could be a result, at least in part, of the inhibitory activity of the acid against topoisomerases.
biological activity of palladium(ii) and platinum(ii) complexes of the acetone schiff bases of s-methyl- and s-benzyldithiocarbazate and the x-ray crystal structure of the [pd(asme)2] (asme=anionic form of the acetone schiff base of s-methyldithiocarbazate) complex.
palladium(ii) and platinum(ii) complexes of general empirical formula, [m(ns)(2)] (ns=uninegatively charged acetone schiff bases of s-methyl- and s-benzyldithiocarbazate; m=pt(ii) and pd(ii)) have been prepared and characterized by a variety of physicochemical techniques. based on conductance, ir and electronic spectral evidence, a square-planar structure is assigned to these complexes. the crystal and molecular structure of the [pd(asme)(2)] complex (asme=anionic form of the acetone schiff base of s-methyldithiocarbazate) has been determined by x-ray diffraction. the complex has a distorted cis-square planar structure with the ligands coordinated to the palladium(ii) ions as uninegatively charged bidentate ns chelating agents via the azomethine nitrogen and the mercaptide sulfur atoms. the distortion from a regular square-planar geometry is attributed to the restricted bite angles of the ligands. antimicrobial tests indicate that the schiff bases exhibit strong activities against the pathogenic bacteria, bacillus subtilis (mutant defective dna repair), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, b. subtilis (wild type) and pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungi, candida albicans (ca), candida lypotica (2075), saccharomyces cerevisiae (20341) and aspergillus ochraceous (398)-the activities exhibited by these compounds being greater than that of the standard antibacterial and antifungal drugs, streptomycin and nystatin, respectively. the palladium(ii) and platinum(ii) complexes are inactive against most of these organisms but, the microbe, pseudomonas aeruginosa shows strong sensitivity to the platinum(ii) complexes. screening of the compounds for their cytotoxicities against t-lymphoblastic leukemia cancer cells has shown that the acetone schiff base of s-methyldithiocarbazate (hasme) exhibits a very weak activity, whereas the s-benzyl derivative (hasbz) is inactive. however, the palladium(ii) complexes exhibit strong cytotoxicities against this cancer; their activities being more than that of the standard anticancer drug, tamoxifen. the [pt(asme)(2)] complex exhibits a very weak cytotoxicity, whereas [pt(asbz)(2)] is inactive against leukemic cells.
antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of clinically relevant blood culture isolates from nine surgical intensive care units, 1996-2000.
in order to elucidate trends in the incidence and susceptibility profiles of causative agents of bacteremia/fungemia in nine surgical intensive care units, a total of 744 isolates obtained during a 5-year period (1996-2000) were studied. the isolates included 698 bacteria and 46 fungi obtained from 523 positive blood cultures, representing 317 episodes of bacteremia/fungemia. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus accounted for 2.3 episodes per 1000 surgical icu admissions in 1996, 1.6 in 1997, 0.3 in 1998, 0.6 in 1999, and 1.7 in 2000. one enterococcus faecalis (vana) isolate resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin was recovered in 1996. ciprofloxacin resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased from 36% in 1996 to 20% in 2000, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins decreased from 40% in 1996 to 9% in 2000. in light of differences between these results and those found elsewhere, these findings might prove useful for making infection control policy decisions in intensive care units.
spectrum of antimicrobial activity and user acceptability of the hand disinfectant agent sterillium gel.
the antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based hand gels has been shown to be significantly less than liquid hand rubs probably because of a lower concentration of alcohol. sterillium gel is the first hand gel with 85% ethanol. its antimicrobial efficacy and user acceptability was studied. bactericidal activity was tested according to pren 12054 against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli (suspension test) and en 1500 (15 volunteers; four replicates), fungicidal activity according to en 1275 against candida albicans and spores of aspergillus niger (suspension test) and tuberculocidal activity against mycobacterium terrae using the dghm suspension test. virucidal activity was determined in suspension tests based on reduction of infectivity with and without interfering substances (10% fetal calf serum; 0.3% erythrocytes and 0.3% bovine serum albumin). ninety-six healthcare workers in hospitals in france and the uk used the gel for four weeks and assessed it by filling out a questionnaire. the gel was bactericidal (a reduction factor of > 10(5)-fold), tuberculocidal (reduction factor > 10(5)) and fungicidal (reduction factor > 10(4)) in 30 s. irrespective of interfering substances the gel inactivated orthopoxvirus and herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 in 15 s, adenovirus in 2 min, poliovirus in 3 min and papovavirus in 15 min by a factor of > 10(4)-fold. rotavirus and human immunodeficiency virus were inactivated in 30 s (without interfering substances). under practical use conditions it was as effective in 30 s as the reference alcohol in 60 s. most users described the tackiness, aggregation, skin feeling after use and smell as positive or acceptable. a total of 65.6% assessed the new gel to be better than a comparator irrespective of its type (gel or liquid). overall sterillium gel had a unique spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it is probably the first alcohol-based hand gel to pass en 1500 in 30 s. due to the excellent acceptance by healthcare workers it may significantly improve compliance for hand hygiene and thereby help to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection.
surveillance of infections acquired in intensive care: usefulness in clinical practice.
nosocomial infection surveillance is common in the usa and in some european countries but in italy few hospitals use it. in order to evaluate its usefulness in clinical practice we performed a one year prospective epidemiological study that included 178 patients, admitted to an intensive care unit (icu) for more than 48 h. median icu stay was 16 days. trauma and neurological diseases accounted for 65% of admissions. the selected population had high severity scores and required a large number of invasive procedures for diagnosis and therapy. the most common infections were: pneumonia 46/1000 ventilator-days; urinary tract infections 17/1000 catheter-days; central venous catheter infections 14.5/1000 catheter-days with 1.7/1000 cvc-related sepsis; bacteraemic sepsis 12/1000 icu-days. the most frequent pathogens were staphylococcus aureus,pseudomonas aeruginosa, other gram-negative aerobes and candida spp. antimicrobial resistance was substantial, with 68% methicillin-resistance in s. aureus and 76% of p. aeruginosa displaying antibiotic resistance. severe sepsis or septic shock occurred in 30 patients (8/1000 icu-days), and three patients died from septic shock of unknown origin (10% case fatality rate). there were no case fatalities for pneumonia and bacteraemic sepsis. overall, icu-acquired infections were not associated with an increased risk of death.
cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus. nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.
[in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate, a new injectable quinolone].
we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate (pzfx mesilate), a new injectable quinolone, and obtained the following results. 1) the mic50 and mic90 values of pzfx against clinically isolated gram-positive and -negative bacteria, ranged from 0.0125 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and 0.025 to 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. pzfx showed broad spectrum activity. the antibacterial activities of pzfx against quinolone-susceptible, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, extended spectrum beta-lactamase possessing klebsiella pneumoniae and imipenem/cilastatine (ipm/cs)-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa were superior to those of ceftazidime (caz), ceftriaxone, ipm/cs, meropenem and panipenem/betamipron. 2) pzfx showed superior bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa to those of caz and ipm/cs after treatment for 15 minutes at the drug concentration equivalent to that in human serum at clinical dose to be continued for 15 minutes. 3) caz and ipm/cs had no bactericidal activity at the 16 times of mic against p. aeruginosa in human polymorphonuclear leucocytes, while pzfx exhibited potent bactericidal activity in a dose-dependent manner against such bacteria. 4) pzfx inhibited both dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv from s. aureus at nearly the same level. pzfx showed poor inhibitory activity against topoisomerase ii from human placenta and showed high selectivity to bacterial topoisomerase. 5) pzfx mesilate showed superior therapeutic activity to that of caz with following infection model caused by s. aureus and p. aeruginosa or each; systemic infection with cyclophosphamide-treated mice, systemic infection in mice with high challenge doses, cmc pouch infection in rat, and calculus infection in rat bladder. 6) intravenous administration of pzfx with high plasma concentration just after administration, showed more excellent therapeutic effect against the rat intraperitoneal infection, than p.o. and s.c. administration.
multidrug pump inhibitors uncover remarkable activity of plant antimicrobials.
plant antimicrobials are not used as systemic antibiotics at present. the main reason for this is their low level of activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria. the reported mic is often in the range of 100 to 1,000 micro g/ml, orders of magnitude higher than those of common broad-spectrum antibiotics from bacteria or fungi. major plant pathogens belong to the gram-negative bacteria, which makes the low level of activity of plant antimicrobials against this group of microorganisms puzzling. gram-negative bacteria have an effective permeability barrier, comprised of the outer membrane, which restricts the penetration of amphipathic compounds, and multidrug resistance pumps (mdrs), which extrude toxins across this barrier. it is possible that the apparent ineffectiveness of plant antimicrobials is largely due to the permeability barrier. we tested this hypothesis in the present study by applying a combination of mdr mutants and mdr inhibitors. a panel of plant antimicrobials was tested by using a set of bacteria representing the main groups of plant pathogens. the human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were also tested. the results show that the activities of the majority of plant antimicrobials were considerably greater against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and bacillus megaterium and that disabling of the mdrs in gram-negative species leads to a striking increase in antimicrobial activity. thus, the activity of rhein, the principal antimicrobial from rhubarb, was potentiated 100- to 2,000-fold (depending on the bacterial species) by disabling the mdrs. comparable potentiation of activity was observed with plumbagin, resveratrol, gossypol, coumestrol, and berberine. direct measurement of the uptake of berberine, a model plant antimicrobial, confirmed that disabling of the mdrs strongly increases the level of penetration of berberine into the cells of gram-negative bacteria. these results suggest that plants might have developed means of delivering their antimicrobials into bacterial cells. these findings also suggest that plant antimicrobials might be developed into effective, broad-spectrum antibiotics in combination with inhibitors of mdrs.
identification and characterization of a novel murine beta-defensin-related gene.
beta-defensins comprise a family of cationic peptides, which are predominately expressed at epithelial surfaces and have a broad-range antimicrobial activity. we have assembled two bac-based contigs from the chromosomal region 8a4 that contain the murine defensins, and we have mapped six reported beta-defensin genes. in addition, we have isolated and functionally characterized a novel beta-defensin gene that deviates from the canonical six cysteine motif present in the mature functional peptide of all other beta-defensins. this defensin-related gene (defr1) is most highly expressed in testis and heart. the genomic organization is highly similar to defb3, 4, 5, and 6, and the exon 1 sequence is very highly conserved. a synthetic defr1 peptide displayed antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and burkholderia cepacia. the antimicrobial activity of defr1 against s. aureus, e.coli, and b. cepacia was found to be reduced in raised concentration of nacl, but its action against p. aeruginosa was independent of nacl concentration. this is the first report of a functional beta defensin that lacks one of the conserved cysteine residues in its predicted mature peptide. this study has major implications for the structure and functions of these important host defense molecules.
design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of beta-lactam-based prodrugs.
by use of pro-dual-drug concept the synthesis of 6-beta-[(r)-2-(clavaminio-9-n-yl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenylacetamido)]penicillanic acid (10), 6-beta-[(r)-2-(amino)-2-(4-(clavulano-9-o-yl)phenylacetamido)]penicillanic acid (13), (z)-4-[2-(amoxycillin-4-o-yl)ethylidene]-2-(clavulano-9-o-yl)-3-methoxy-delta(alp ha,beta)-butenolide (19), and 3-[(amoxicillin-4-o-yl)methyl]-7-(phenoxyacetamido)-(1-oxo)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (23) was accomplished. unlike penicillin g, ampicillin, or amoxicillin, these four heretofore undescribed compounds 10, 13, 19, and 23 showed notable activity against beta-lactamase (betal) producing microorganisms, staphylococcus aureus a9606, s. aureus a15091, s. aureus a20309, s. aureus 95, escherichia coli a9675, e. coli a21223, e. coli 27c7, pseudomonas aeruginosa 18s-h, and klebsiella pneumoniae a20634 tem. in comparison with amoxicillin (9), alpha-amino-substituted compound 10 and butenolide derivative 19 showed a broadened spectrum of antibacterial activity; yet they were found to be less active than 13 and 23. like clavulanic acid (7) or cephalosporin-1-oxide (21), the newly synthesized compounds 10, 13, 15, 16, 19, or 23 functioned as potent inhibitors of various bacterial betals.
effects of some plant extracts and antibiotics on pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from various burn cases.
objective: to determine the major groups of bacteria associated with burn infections, isolation of pseudomonas aeruginosa from burn cases, and the testing of antibacterial activity of some plant extracts in comparison with the standard antibiotics. methods: a total of 92 burn cases, covered with tetracycline (40 cases) and non-covered with tetracycline (52 cases) from both sex and various ages, were collected from various hospitals in basrah city, iraq on the year 2001. bacteriological investigation for isolation of bacterial pathogens especially pseudomonas aeruginosa was carried out. two methods were used to evaluate the anti-bacterial activity of various concentrations of aqueous extracts of leaves of myrtus communis and eucalyptus with comparison to 6 antibiotics, these methods were to determine the growth inhibition zones and minimal inhibitory concentration. results: from a total 92 cases, 78 (84.8%) gave positive cultures. one hundred and fifty eight isolates were identified as bacterial pathogens. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the predominant bacterial pathogen from 35.9% of the tetracycline covered burns and 42.3% of the non-tetracycline covered burns followed by other bacterial types in various percentages. aqueous leaves extracts of myrtus communis and eucalyptus gave an excellent effect on bacterial growth and their effects were located within the limits of antibiotic effects. conclusion: pseudomonas aeruginosa was the predominant bacterial isolate followed by staphylococcus aureus, then other type of bacterial was isolated in various percentage from each tetracycline covered burns and non-tetracycline covered burns. most concentrations of the extracts of the studied plants showed a high antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and showed significant differences between susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from each tetracycline covered burn and non-tetracycline covered burn.
screening of some siberian medicinal plants for antimicrobial activity.
the antimicrobial activity of crude ethanolic extracts of 16 siberian medicinal plants was tested against five species of microorganisms: bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans. of the 16 plants tested, 12 showed antimicrobial activity against one or more species of microorganisms. the most active antimicrobial plants were bergenia crassifolia, chelidonium majus, rhaponticum carthamoides, sanguisorba officinalis, and tussilago farfara.
coleonema album: studies of the pharmacological action on smooth muscle in vitro  and antimicrobial action of its essential oil.
the mode of action of the essential oil of coleonema album, a south african species from the cape region, was studied on smooth muscle in vitro using field-stimulated guinea-pig ileum. the oil produced an initial spasmogenic activity followed by spasmolysis, both actions being dose-dependent. the spasmolytic action was post-synaptic and not atropine-like and was unaffected by the adrenoceptor blockers phentolamine and propranolol. there was no evidence for the involvement of either cyclic guanosine monophosphate or cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the spasmolytic activity. the oil had some calcium channel blocking activity but this is not the primary explanation for its spasmolytic response. antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphyloccocus aureus and saccharomyces cerevisiae was very low and totally absent against enterococcus hirae, suggesting that the oil has no worthwhile potential in this area. however, as the oil has a very disagreeable odour in its undiluted form, it could be a powerful insect repellent, as its local usage suggests, and this remains to be investigated.
influence of mucin on the activity of the antiseptic lavasept against staphylococcus aureus.
background: lavasept, containing the polymeric biguanide polyhexanide, may be effective against staphylococcus aureus colonizing the nasal mucosa. to obtain basic data on its suitability for that purpose, its antimicrobial activity was examined in the presence of mucin. methods: a disk diffusion test was applied using mueller-hinton agar, and disks soaked with a therapeutic and a 10-fold higher concentration of lavasept. commercially available mucin preparations from porcine stomach were added to the test system. reference strains and 20 clinically isolates of s. aureus, and reference strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans were tested. results: supplementation of the test medium with 1% mucin completely abolished the activity of disks loaded with the therapeutically used concentration of the antiseptic. the neutralizing effect of mucin occurred with all test strains. conclusions: the inactivation of lavasept by mucin may hamper a reliable clearance of nasal s. aureus carriage.
comparative in-vitro activities of ertapenem against aerobic bacterial pathogens  isolated from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections.
the in vitro activities of ertapenem, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, and piperacillin-tazobactam were compared against 1018 aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated from 531 patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection. enterobacteriaceae accounted for 66.3% of the aerobic bacteria; escherichia coli was the most common isolate. the ertapenem minimal inhibitory concentration was < or = 2 microg/ml for 74.6% of isolates and > or = 8 microg/ml for 21.9% (including isolates of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). against enterobacteriaceae, ertapenem was the most potent and the most active drug evaluated (100% susceptible), followed by ceftriaxone (98% susceptible), piperacillin-tazobactam (96% susceptible), amoxicillin-clavulanate (80% susceptible), and ampicillin-sulbactam (64% susceptible). piperacillin-tazobactam was the only drug evaluated with clinically useful activity against p. aeruginosa. in summary, ertapenem was highly active in vitro against many clinically important aerobic intra-abdominal bacterial pathogens, especially enterobacteriaceae.
comparative in vitro activities of ertapenem against aerobic and facultative bacterial pathogens from patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections.
this study compared the in vitro activities of ertapenem (merck & co., inc.), ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 518 aerobic and facultative bacterial pathogens isolated from 340 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. ciprofloxacin was also tested against gram-negative isolates. gram-positive cocci accounted for 68.1% of the aerobic bacteria; staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate (45.6%). the ertapenem mic was < or = 2 microg/ml for 80.9% of isolates and > or = 8 microg/ml for 16.2% (including isolates of enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria). against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, ertapenem had the most potent activity. ertapenem was the most active drug against enterobacteriaceae (100% susceptible), whereas amoxicillin-clavulanate was least active (66% susceptible). piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active drug against p. aeruginosa (100% susceptible), followed by ciprofloxacin (87% susceptible). in summary, ertapenem was highly active in vitro against many aerobic and facultative bacterial pathogens commonly recovered from patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections.
synthesis and microbiological activity of some n-(2-hydroxy-4-substitutedphenyl)benzamides, phenylacetamides and furamides as the possible metabolites of antimicrobial active benzoxazoles.
the synthesis of some n-(2-hydroxy-4-substitutedphenyl)benzamides, phenylacetamides and furamides as the possible metabolites of benzoxazoles (ii1-15) was performed in order to determine their in vitro antimicrobial activity against three gram-positive bacteria, two gram-negative bacteria and the fungus candida albicans and their activities were compared with several control drugs. the compounds ii11, ii12, and ii13 were found active at a mic value of 12.5 microg/ml against the gram-negative microorganism pseudomonas aeruginosa. most of the compounds show antibacterial activity at mic a value of 25 microg/ml against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus. for the antifungal activity against c. albicans, compound ii10 was found more active than the other derivatives. the antimicrobial activity of some of these benzamides, phenylacetamides (ii1 and ii10) which are the possible metabolites of benzoxazoles, was also compared to their corresponding cyclic analogues iii-iv. compound ii10 possesses two dilutions better antifungal activity than its cyclic analogue, benzoxazole iv, against c. albicans.
[piperacillin/tazobactam--tazocin. a penicillin-based alternative to 3rd generation cephalosporins and carbapenems].
the antibiotic piperacillin/tazobactam has recently been licensed for use in denmark. piperacillin/tazobactam combines a well known beta-lactam antibiotitic, piperacillin, and an inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamase, tazobactam. the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam compared to piperacillin alone has an expanded antimicrobial spectrum, which includes klebsiellae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris resistant to ampicillin, as well as beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus aureus. as piperacillin in itself possesses antimicrobial activity against streptococci, enterococci, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin/tazobactam indicates that the combination may constitute an alternative to third generation cephalosporins and carbapenems in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections infections in critically ill patients and for the empirical treatment of acute neutropenic febrile patients, as indicated by clinical studies.
a novel type of conserved dna-binding domain in the transcriptional regulators of the algr/agra/lytr family.
sequence analysis of bacterial genomes revealed a novel dna-binding domain. this  domain is found in several response regulators of the two-component signal transduction system, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa algr, involved in the regulation of alginate biosynthesis and in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis; clostridium perfringens virr, a regulator of virulence factors, and in several regulators of bacteriocin biosynthesis, previously unified in the agra/come family. most of the transcriptional regulators that contain this dna-binding domain are involved in biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, fimbriation, expression of exoproteins, including toxins, and quorum sensing. we refer to it as the lyttr ('litter') domain, after bacillus subtilis lytt and staphylococcus aureus lytr response regulators, involved in regulation of cell autolysis. in addition to response regulators, the lyttr domain is found in combination with mhyt, pas and other sensor domains.
[antibiotic activity of p. aeruginosa against mrsa and candida albicans].
the antibiotic activity demonstrated by p. aeruginosa (bacillus pyocyaneus) has been reported more than one hundred years ago by emmerich et al (1899). studies on such bacterial interference between p. aeruginosa and other pathogenic bacteria or fungi have not been extensively reported in recent years. in this paper, we report on the anti mrsa activity and anti candida activity demonstrated by clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa (34 strains). the antibiotic activity was tested by reversed agar plate method, as previously reported, and the degree of the activity was expressed as the diameter of the zone of growth inhibition. the stability of both anti mrsa activity and anti candida activity was evaluated at the time after 24 and 48-hr incubation. also the effect of agar plate with or without 5% sheep blood on antibiotic activity was evaluated. strong anti mrsa activity and anti candida activity was shown at the time after 24-hr incubation. at the time after 48-hr incubation, anti mrsa activities were significantly suppressed but anti candida activities were persisted. the inhibitory activity was correlated with dye production of p. aeruginosa. some strains having non or weak dye production, showed the inhibitory activity by 48-hr incubation. result from these strains without suppression of anti candida activity by additional blood may suggest that the existence of a new factor produced by p. aeruginosa. because of frequent isolation of mrsa or candida from clinical materials, we must consider bacterial flora and bacterial interference against pathogenic bacteria at the time of the antibiotic choice for the patients infected or colonized with p. aeruginosa.
in vitro susceptibility of new generation of antibacterial antibiotics against pathogenic bacteria.
antibiotic susceptibility of ten bacteria i.e. neisseria catarrhalis, salmonella  typhi, s. enteritidis, haemophilus influenzae, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas fluorescence, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and e. coli to twenty antibiotics i.e. cefpirom (30 mcg), ceftriaxone (30 mcg), erythromycin (15 mcg), doxycycline (30 mcg) lomefloxacin (10 mcg), sisomicin (30 mcg), vancomycin (30 mcg), augmentin (30 mcg), ampicillin (30 mcg), cotrimoxazole (25 mcg), cefotaxime (30 mcg), chloramphenicol (30 mcg), cephalexin (30 mcg), tetracycline (30 mcg), ciprofloxacin (5 mcg), nitrofurantoin (300 mcg), nalidixic acid (30 mcg), pefloxacin (10 mcg), norfloxacin and ofloxacin (5 mcg) was studied to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of recently introduced second and third generation antibiotics. all the test strains were sensitive to pefloxacin, erythromycin, augmentin and chloramphenicol. maximum resistance to cefpirom excluding e. coli and s. typhi and co-trimoxazole except s. typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed, occasional resistance was seen against ceftriaxone, vancomycin and cefotaxime.
hospital-acquired respiratory tract infections: clinical experience with beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors.
the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia presents a major treatment challenge and one complicated by the rising prevalence of multidrug resistance among nosocomial pathogens. contemporary treatment strategies for nosocomial pneumonia, which is most often attributable to gram-negative bacilli or staphylococcus aureus, mandate early empiric therapy with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. the choice of agents for empiric therapy is fundamental to outcome, and the selection of inappropriate agents, to which pathogens are resistant, contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. the adoption of practice guidelines, such as those proposed by the american thoracic society, can help to guide antibiotic selection, especially when combined with knowledge of local patterns of infection and antimicrobial susceptibility. beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, particularly those with activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, are among the core antibiotic agents considered suitable for empiric therapy of nosocomial pneumonia. they are particularly suited to use in hospitals with high rates of beta-lactamase-mediated resistance, especially resistance due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, infections with acinetobacter spp. and those of mixed aetiology.
strategy of control of nosocomial infections: application of disinfectants such as povidone-iodine.
at morioka yuai hospital, the infection control division was set up 5 years ago,  and it has made efforts to actively control infections. in particular, the division succeeded in increasing the frequency of general round table discussions for patients with infections. we strongly recommend to frequently gargle with isodine at operations. recently, we have followed up patients with infections caused by mrsa, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia or carriers of these bacteria, and determined the drug sensitivities of clinical isolates. in addition, because of the current highly aged society, a high percentage of inpatients has various underlying diseases. in particular, there are quite a few cases in which pneumonia occurs as an opportunistic infection. from studies in these patients and patients of the dental department, it has been shown that oral microorganisms clearly decrease in count by careful tooth brushing and gargling with isodine, with prevention of pneumonitis caused by oral microorganisms. as we consider that antisepsis with povidone-iodine is useful for the prevention of nosocomial and opportunistic infections, we would like to report the findings of our study currently under way.
characterization of the mouse beta defensin 1, defb1, mutant mouse model.
beta defensins are small cationic antimicrobial peptides present in the respiratory system which have been proposed to be dysfunctional in the environment of the cystic fibrosis lung. defb1, a murine homologue to the human beta defensins, has also been found to be expressed in the respiratory system and, in order to examine the function of beta defensins in vivo, gene targeting was used to generate defb1-deficient (defb1(tm1hgu)/defb1(tm1hgu) [defb1(-/-)]) mice. the defb1 synthetic peptide was shown to have a salt-sensitive antimicrobial activity that was stronger against staphylococcus aureus than against escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa. defb1(-/-) mice were found, however, to be effective in the clearance of the cystic fibrosis relevant pathogen s. aureus from the airways after nebulization. although no overt deleterious phenotype was evident in the defb1(-/-) mice, the number of mutant mice found to harbor bacteria of the staphylococcus species in the bladder was significantly higher (p = 0.008) than that of controls, suggesting a role for these peptides in resistance to urinary tract infection.
hospital-acquired infections following the 1999 marmara earthquake.
in this study, medical records of all casualties admitted to our hospital following the marmara earthquake, which struck northwest turkey and resulted in the destruction of several towns in the marmara region, were evaluated retrospectively. the time buried under the rubble, demographic data, type of medical and surgical therapies performed, type of injury and data on infection were analysed. between 17 august and 25 september 1999, 630 trauma victims were received at our hospital and 532 (84%) of them were hospitalized. the mean age of hospitalized patients (312 males, 220 females) was 32 years (2-90 years). two hundred and twenty patients were hospitalized for more than 48 h. forty-one of them (18.6%) had 43 hospital-acquired infection (hai) episodes, which were mostly wound infections (46.5%). a total of 143 culture specimens was collected and 48 yielded the following potential pathogens: 15 acinetobacter baumanii (31.2%), nine staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), seven pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.6%), six escherichia coli (12.5%), six klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), two stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.2%) and three various pseudomonas spp. (6.3%). all s. aureus strains were found to be resistant to methicillin in vitro. two strains of a. baumannii and one p. aeruginosa were found to be resistant to all antimicrobials including carbapenems. fifty-three victims died (10%) and 36 of those died during the first 48 h because of severe injuries and multi-organ failure. after 48 h of hospitalization, the mortality rate was significantly higher in those patients with hai (14/41) than those without (3/179) (34.1% vs. 1.7%, p<0.05). in conclusion, trauma is the significant factor associated with hai and a high incidence of acinetobacter strains was responsible for hai in trauma patients.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel 2-(p-substituted-phenyl)-5-substituted-carbonylaminobenzoxazoles.
a series of 2-(p-substituted-phenyl)-5-substituted-carbonylamino benzoxazole derivatives (5-22) was synthesized and their antimicrobial activities determined in comparison to several control drugs. the synthesized compounds were tested in vitro against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis as gram-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli as gram-negative bacteria and the yeast candida albicans. microbiological results showed that the compounds possessed a diffuse spectrum of antibacterial activity against these microorganisms. compound 9 which bears a phenylacetamido moiety at position 5 and a 4-fluorophenyl group at the 2-position of benzoxazole ring was the most active derivative against s. aureus, s. faecalis and p. aeruginosa with a mic value of 12.5 microg/ml. compound 11 provided higher potency than the other tested compounds against b. subtilis at a mic value of 12.5 microg/ml. compounds 5-22 showed antifungal activity against c. albicans with mic values between 50 and 12.5 microg/ml.
ventilator-associated pneumonia.
ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) continues to complicate the course of 8 to  28% of patients receiving mechanical ventilation (mv). in contrast to infections of more frequently involved organs (e.g., urinary tract and skin), for which mortality is low, ranging from 1 to 4%, the mortality rate for vap ranges from 24 to 50% and can reach 76% in some specific settings or when lung infection is caused by high-risk pathogens. the predominant organisms responsible for infection are staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae, but etiologic agents widely differ according to the population of patients in an intensive care unit, duration of hospital stay, and prior antimicrobial therapy. because appropriate antimicrobial treatment of patients with vap significantly improves outcome, more rapid identification of infected patients and accurate selection of antimicrobial agents represent important clinical goals. our personal bias is that using bronchoscopic techniques to obtain protected brush and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the affected area in the lung permits physicians to devise a therapeutic strategy that is superior to one based only on clinical evaluation. when fiberoptic bronchoscopy is not available to physicians treating patients clinically suspected of having vap, we recommend using either a simplified nonbronchoscopic diagnostic procedure or following a strategy in which decisions regarding antibiotic therapy are based on a clinical score constructed from seven variables. selection of the initial antimicrobial therapy should be based on predominant flora responsible for vap at each institution, clinical setting, information provided by direct examination of pulmonary secretions, and intrinsic antibacterial activities of antimicrobial agents and their pharmacokinetic characteristics. further trials will be needed to clarify the optimal duration of treatment and the circumstances in which monotherapy can be safely used.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some new hydrazones of 4-fluorobenzoic acid hydrazide and 3-acetyl-2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazolines.
a series of hydrazide hydrazones and 1,3,4-oxadiazolines of 4-fluorobenzoic acid  hydrazide were prepared and evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents and were tested for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. from these compounds, 4-fluorobenzoic acid[(5-nitro-2-furanyl)methylene]hydrazide (1a) showed equal activity with ceftriaxone against s. aureus. in addition, the mic values of compounds 1c, 1d and 2a for the same strain were in the range of those reported for ceftriaxone according to nccls 1997.
antimicrobial activity of prenylflavanones.
among two flavanones [ys01, ys02] and eight prenylflavanones [ys03-ys10], preliminary screening with fifteen test bacterial strains showed that ys06 was the most active agent. ys06 exhibited highly significant antimicrobial action when tested against 228 bacterial strains comprising two gram-positive and six gram-negative genera. the in vitro susceptibility test was carried out by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ys06 by agar dilution technique. twenty-two out of fifty strains of staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at 25 to 50 micrograms/ml of the agent. ys06 also inhibited strains of salmonella, shigella and a few strains of escherichia coli strains were also highly sensitive to ys06, while kleibsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were much less sensitive. in in vivo study, ys06 offered significant protection (p < 0.001 according to chi-square test) to swiss albino mice (challenged with 50 minimum lethal dose (mld, virulent bacterium) at concentrations of 160 and 80 micrograms/mouse.
in vitro antibacterial activities of dq-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
the antibacterial activity of dq-113, formerly d61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (mic90s) of dq-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. moreover, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, with a mic90 of 0.25microg/ml. dq-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and dq-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with mic90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, dq-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a mic range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. dq-113 also showed a potent activity against haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (mic90, 0.015 microg/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.03 microg/ml). the activity of dq-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of enterobacteriaceae: the mics of dq-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. from these results, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
[current therapeutical management, new antibiotics and treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacterial ent-infections].
in bacterial infections of the sinuses and the middle ear streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated, whereas in tonsillopharyngitis streptococcus pyogenes is the most important pathogen. s. aureus is found in up to 40 % in acute and chronic sinusitis and causes severe complications in otitis media, therefore antibiotics used as empirical initial treatment should also be effective against this pathogen. to decrease duration of illness and to avoid serious complications antibiotic treatment of bacterial ent-infections is necessary. the new ketolides and the third and fourth generation quinolones are very effective and the second generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime axetil have proven excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in numerous clinical trials combined with an excellent resistance pattern over the years. efficacy of short course therapy (5 days) in sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis has been proven in clinical trials and is cost saving. in more severe infections treated in hospital sequential i. v./oral therapy offers pharmaco-economical benefits. both regimen demonstrate cost savings while maintaining high clinical efficacy. in more severe infections like otitis externa diffusa, otitis externa maligna, otitis media chronica and perichondritis pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen that has to be covered by initial antibiotic treatment. ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are widely used and effective. ciprofloxacin resistance has increased, while ceftazidime susceptibility is unchanged (> 90 %). a dose reduction study with ceftazidime in severe ent-infections showed equivocal efficacy between 3 x 1 g and 3 x 2 g daily that offers a cost benefit of 50 %.
use of a staphylococcus aureus conjugate vaccine in patients receiving hemodialysis.
background: in patients with decreased resistance to infection, staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of bacteremia and its complications. the capsular polysaccharides are essential for the pathogenesis of and immunity to s. aureus infection and are targets for vaccines. methods: in a double-blind trial involving patients with end-stage renal disease who were receiving hemodialysis, we evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a vaccine with s. aureus type 5 and 8 capsular polysaccharides conjugated to nontoxic recombinant pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a. between april 1998 and august 1999, 1804 adult patients at 73 hemodialysis centers were randomly assigned to receive a single intramuscular injection of either vaccine or saline. igg antibodies to s. aureus type 5 and 8 capsular polysaccharides were measured for up to two years, and episodes of s. aureus bacteremia were recorded. efficacy was estimated by comparing the incidence of s. aureus bacteremia in the patients who received the vaccine with the incidence in the control patients. results: reactions to the vaccine were generally mild to moderate, and most resolved within two days. the capsular polysaccharides elicited an antibody response of at least 80 microg per milliliter (the estimated minimal level conferring protection) in 80 percent of patients for type 5 and in 75 percent of patients for type 8. the efficacy during weeks 3 to 54 was only 26 percent (p=0.23). however, between weeks 3 and 40 after vaccination, s. aureus bacteremia developed in 11 of 892 patients in the vaccine group who could be evaluated for bacteremia, as compared with 26 of 906 patients in the control group (estimate of efficacy, 57 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 10 to 81 percent; nominal p=0.02). conclusions: in patients receiving hemodialysis, a conjugate vaccine can confer partial immunity against s. aureus bacteremia for approximately 40 weeks, after which protection wanes as antibody levels decrease.
antimicrobial drug use and resistance in dogs.
fifteen years (1984-1998) of records from a veterinary teaching hospital were analyzed to determine whether antimicrobial drug resistance in coagulase-positive staphylococcus spp. (s. aureus, s. intermedius) isolated from clinical infections in dogs has increased, and whether there has been a change in the species of bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections in dogs. in coagulase-positive staphylococcus spp., a complex pattern showing both increases and decreases of resistance to different classes of antimicrobial drugs was observed, reflecting the changing use of different antimicrobial drug classes in the hospital over a similar period (1990-1999). in canine urinary tract infections identified from 1984 to 1998, an increase in the incidence of multiresistant enterococcus spp. was apparent, with marginal increases also in incidence in enterobacter spp. and in pseudomonas aeruginosa, both of which, like enterococcus spp., are innately antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. a survey of directors of veterinary teaching hospitals in canada and the united states identified only 3 hospitals that had any policy on use of "last resort" antimicrobial drugs (amikacin, imipenem, vancomycin). evidence is briefly reviewed that owners may be at risk when dogs are treated with antimicrobial drugs, as well as evidence that some resistant bacteria may be acquired by dogs as a result of antimicrobial drug use in agriculture. based in part on gaps in our knowledge, recommendations are made on prudent use of antimicrobial drugs in companion animals, as well as on the need to develop science-based infection control programs in veterinary hospitals.
antimicrobial effect of resveratrol on dermatophytes and bacterial pathogens of the skin.
the phytoalexin resveratrol is commonly found in food and drinks, including red wine, grapes, and peanuts. many studies have shown that this compound has anti-inflammatory properties, and it has been ascribed as having health benefits that help to prevent cancer and coronary heart disease. a treatment that combines antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions may be desirable for alleviating many skin conditions that range in severity. therefore, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of resveratrol against bacteria and dermatophytes that are major etiologic agents of human skin infections. using the broth microdilution protocol of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) m7-a5, growth of the bacterial species staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited at 171-342 microg/ml of resveratrol in the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide. using the nccls protocol m38-p, activity against the fungal species trichophyton mentagrophytes, trichophyton tonsurans, trichophyton rubrum, epidermophyton floccosum, and microsporum gypseum was also tested. the growth of dermatophytes was inhibited at 25-50 microg/ml of resveratrol. thus, this study indicates a novel application for resveratrol, a molecule of plant defense, to combat human fungal pathogens. resveratrol and its analogs may have wide application to skin conditions that afflict a significant portion of our population, and may also have promising clinical potentials in diabetic wounds.
human beta-defensin-2 production in keratinocytes is regulated by interleukin-1,  bacteria, and the state of differentiation.
intact human epidermis resists invasion by pathogenic microbes but the biochemical basis of its resistance is not well understood. recently, an antimicrobial peptide, human beta-defensin-2, was discovered in inflamed epidermis. we used a recombinant baculovirus/insect cell system to produce human beta-defensin-2 and confirmed that at micromolar concentrations it has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, with the striking exception of staphylococcus aureus. immunostaining with a polyclonal antibody to human beta-defensin-2 showed that the expression of human beta-defensin-2 peptide by human keratinocytes required differentiation of the cells (either by increased calcium concentration or by growth and maturation in epidermal organotypic culture) as well as a cytokine or bacterial stimulus. interleukin-1alpha, interleukin-1beta, or live pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be the most effective stimuli whereas other bacteria and cytokines had little or no ability to induce human beta-defensin-2 synthesis. in interleukin-1alpha-stimulated epidermal cultures, human beta-defensin-2 first appeared in the cytoplasm in differentiated suprabasal layers of skin, next in a more peripheral web-like distribution in the upper layers of the epidermis, and then over a few days migrated to the stratum corneum. by semiquantitative western blot analysis of epidermal lysates, the average concentration of human beta-defensin-2 in stimulated organotypic epidermal culture reached 15--70 microg per gram of tissue, i.e., 3.5-16 microm, well within the range required for antimicrobial activity. because of the restricted pattern of human beta-defensin-2 distribution in the epidermis, its local concentration must be much higher. defensins and other antimicrobial peptides of inflamed epidermis are likely to play an important antimicrobial role in host defense against cutaneous pathogens.
the effects of charge and lipophilicity on the antibacterial activity of undecapeptides derived from bovine lactoferricin.
we have investigated the effects of charge and lipophilicity on the antibacterial activity of an undecapeptide (fkcrrwqwrmk) derived from the sequence of bovine lactoferricin. we prepared ten analogues that were modified by the incorporation of ala, tyr, trp, met and arg residues, which are amino acids known to be important for the antibacterial activity of longer derivatives of lactoferricins. all undecapeptides contained the native trp residues in positions 6 and 8, and the arg residues in positions 5 and 9. generally, the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus was more susceptible to these undecapeptides than the gram-negative bacteria, and a higher antibacterial activity was observed against escherichia coli than against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the only exception was the peptide undeca 9 (rrwyrwawrmr-nh2), which was almost equally active against all three test strains, displaying minimal inhibitory concentrations of 10 microg/ml (5.8 microm), 7.5 microg/ml (4.4 microm) and 5 microg/ml (2.9 microm) against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. the peptides undeca 6 (yrawrwawrwr-nh2) and undeca 7 (yrmwrwawrwr-nh2) were the two most active undecapeptides against staphylococcus aureus, both displaying a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2.5 microg/ml (1.5 microm). the study showed that a level was reached in which undecapeptides having a net charge above +4 and containing three or four trp residues all displayed a high antibacterial activity. all undecapeptides prepared were essentially non-haemolytic, but undecapeptides containing more than three trp residues displayed 50% haemolysis of human red blood cells at concentrations above 400 microg/ml (>230 microm).
synthesis and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some 2-[[alpha-(4-substituted benzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)- 1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
in this study, a new series of 1-[[alpha-(4-substitutedbenzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were obtained by condensation of 2-[(alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl or alpha-bromopropionyl)amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)1,3,4-oxadiazoles with sodium salts of 4-substituted benzoic acids. structures of the compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral data (uv, ir, 1h nmr, el ms) and elemental analyses. the antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538. staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans atcc 10231 were tested using disk diffusion method. compounds 4a, 4d and 4g were found to be active against s. aureus atcc 6538 (mic, 78, 39 and 78 microg ml(-1), respectively) and compound 4e against s. epidermidis atcc 12228 (mic, 156 microg ml(-1)).

cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.
present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.
in vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
the in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium were determined. the minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae. the antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). the clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. one strain of haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy. adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. in one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45 &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
clinical aspiration-related practice patterns in the intensive care unit: a physician survey.
objective: to characterize physician practice patterns regarding the clinical, microbiological, and antimicrobial-related events of suspected or documented aspiration and aspiration pneumonia within the intensive care unit. design: national mail survey. setting: university medical center. study population: critical care physician members of the society of critical care medicine. interventions: survey questionnaire. measurements and main results: the response rate was 645 (32%) of 2,000 mailed surveys; analysis of data represents completed questionnaires from 605 respondents. intensivists (42.3%), pulmonologists (22.6%), and surgeons (21.6%) represent the majority of respondents. altered level of consciousness (67.9%) in the intensive care unit was identified as the predominant predisposing factor for aspiration pneumonia. sixty-four percent of physicians used sputum specimens, rather than protected specimen brushes or bronchoalveolar lavage, as the diagnostic source of bacterial cultures in cases of suspected aspiration pneumonia. microbiological assessment of aspiration pneumonia revealed the absence of any predominant pathogen, although staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were cited in 40.1% of combined responses, whereas anaerobes represented the fifth most prevalent cultured bacteria. in cases of suspected and confirmed aspiration, 51.9% and 77.7% of respondents, respectively, would prescribe an antimicrobial agent in the absence of a definitive infectious process, with administration of dual antimicrobial therapy increasing from 28.9% to 46.0% in suspected vs. confirmed cases of aspiration. in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia, 27.6% of physicians preferred pathogen-specific therapy, whereas the remainder (72.4%) selected an empirical antibiotic regimen based on prior clinical experience. overall, a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor, followed by a cephalosporin, aminoglycoside in combination, or clindamycin, was most often selected for empirical therapy of all defined aspiration-related clinical diagnoses. conclusions: our study revealed a divergent approach to antimicrobial treatment of cases of aspiration in the intensive care unit. further investigation is warranted to determine why empirical antimicrobials are initiated frequently for noninfectious stages of aspiration.
the effect of an antimicrobial formulary change on hospital resistance patterns.
a university hospital formulary change that was designed to reduce the use of the third-generation cephalosporins ceftazidime and cefotaxime and replace them with the so-called "fourth-generation" cephalosporin cefepime was evaluated. a retrospective review of antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance during two 6-month periods before and after the formulary change was performed. all hospital patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), ceftazidime-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (crkp), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), piperacillin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (prpa), and ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa (crpa) infections were included in the study ceftazidime use decreased from 9600 g to 99 g, and cefotaxime use decreased from 6314 g to 732 g, which represented a combined decrease of 89%. use of cefepime increased from 0 g to 5396 g. infections from crkp decreased from 13% to 3%, prpa infections decreased from 22% to 14%, and crpa infections decreased from 25% to 15% (p<0.05 for all). infections from mrsa dropped insignificantly, and vre infections increased significantly. substituting cefepime for ceftazidime and cefotaxime while reducing the overall use of cephalosporins appears to decrease rates of crkp, prpa, and crpa.
control of wound infections using a bilayer chitosan wound dressing with sustainable antibiotic delivery.
a novel bilayer chitosan membrane was prepared by a combined wet/dry phase inversion method and evaluated as a wound dressing. this new type of bilayer chitosan wound dressing, consisting of a dense upper layer (skin layer) and a sponge-like lower layer (sublayer), is very suitable for use as a topical delivery of silver sulfadiazine (agsd) for the control of wound infections. physical characterization of the bilayer wound dressing showed that it has excellent oxygen permeability, that it controls the water vapor transmission rate, and that it promotes water uptake capability. agsd dissolved from bilayer chitosan dressings to release silver and sulfadiazine. the release of sulfadiazine from the bilayer chitosan dressing displayed a burst release on the first day and then tapered off to a much slower release. however, the release of silver from the bilayer chitosan dressing displayed a slow release profile with a sustained increase of silver concentration. the cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus in agar plates showed effective antimicrobial activity for 1 week. in vivo antibacterial tests confirmed that this wound dressing is effective for long-term inhibition of the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus at an infected wound site. the results in this study indicate that the agsd-incorporated bilayer chitosan wound dressing may be a material with potential antibacterial capability for the treatment of infected wounds.
treatment trial of subclinical mastitis with the herb persicaria senegalense (polygonaceae).
the possible remedial effect of persicaria senegalense in bovine subclinical mastitis was studied by in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial tests, using crude extracts and the leaf in different forms. the in vitro test showed that isolates of staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and corynebacterium bovis from subclinical cases and an isolate of pseudomonas aeruginosa from a clinical case of mastitis were all inhibited by the three crude extracts at 820 micrograms concentration. an in vivo trial feeding 1.5 kg of the cooked leaf per day for 5 days did not give a significant cure rate, whereas a second trial in which 0.77 kg of leaf powder, equivalent to 3 kg of wet leaf, was fed per day for 5 days resulted in an apparent cure rate of 92.8% (52.8% actual as there was a 40% spontaneous cure rate in the negative control group, in contrast to 80% (40% actual) in the positive control group treated with an intramammary antibiotic preparation. the difference in cure rate between the negative control group and the experimental group given 0.77 kg leaf powder was significant (p = 0.008).
effect of sulfur hexafluoride gas on antibacterial activity of antibiotics in vitro against agents causing endophthalmitis.
background: we conducted a study to evaluate the effect of sulfur hexafluoride gas (sf(6)) on the antibacterial activity of antibiotics in vitro against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are common endophthalmitis-causing agents. methods: in this experimental study, antibiotic susceptibility tests were prepared according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards macrobroth dilution method. muller-hinton broth was the test medium. standard p. aeruginosa (atcc 27853), s. epidermidis (atcc 12228) and s. aureus (atcc 29213) strains were studied. for p. aeruginosa ceftazidime, ofloxacin and tobramycin dilutions, and for s. epidermidis and s. aureus, cefazolin, ofloxacin and tobramycin dilutions were prepared identically in two sets of tubes. one set of tubes, into which pure sf(6) was injected, was defined as the sf(6) group. the other set of tubes, into which no sf(6) was injected, was taken as the control group. to determine the minimal bactericidal concentrations of the antibiotics, subcultures were made onto muller-hinton agar, and the colonies were counted after 18 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. results: the minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics in the sf(6) group were found to be identical with those of the control group. however, the minimal bactericidal concentrations of the antibiotics were found to be at least two dilutions lower in the sf(6) group than in the control group, except for the minimal bactericidal concentration of cefazolin for s. aureus, which was found to be one dilution lower in the sf(6) group. conclusion: sf(6) was found to potentiate the in vitro antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and tobramycin against s. aureus, s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa, ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa, and cefazolin against s. epidermidis. experimental animal studies are required to determine the role of sf(6) in the management of endophthalmitis.
bacterial adhesion to surface hydrophilic and hydrophobic contact lenses.
the aim of this paper was to determine the adhesion of two physico-chemically characterized bacterial strains to a surface hydrophilic (cl a, water contact angle 57 degrees) and hydrophobic (cl b, water contact angle 106 degrees) hydrogel contact lens (cl) with and without an adsorbed tear film in a parallel plate flow chamber. hydrophobicity (by water contact angles), charge (by particulate microelectrophoresis) and elemental composition (by xps) of the surfaces of seven bacterial strains were characterized, after which two strains were selected for further studies. on cl surfaces, hydrophobicity, elemental composition, and mean surface roughness (by afm) were determined, as well as the protein composition of tear films adsorbed on these lenses (by sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page)). bacterial cell surfaces were relatively uncharged and water contact angles on lawns of different strains ranged from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. after adsorption of tear film components, n/c elemental surface concentrations increased on cl a and cl b and differences in water contact angles between both lenses reduced to range from 57 degrees (cl a) to 69 degrees (cl b). however, different protein compositions were inferred. the surface roughness of cl a increased from 4 to 13 nm. while it remained 16 nm for cl b. adhesion of hydrophobic pseudomonas aeruginosa #3 was more extensive than of hydrophilic staphylococcus aureus 799, with no differences between both lenses. the hydrophobicity of p. aeruginosa #3 after cell surface damage decreased and its adhesion was reduced on cl a and strongly on cl b. in addition, passage of an air-liquid interface yielded more detachment of s. aureus 799 than of p. aeruginosa #3 from the cl surfaces. in conclusion, the hydrophobicity of cl surfaces dictates the composition of the adsorbed tear film and therewith plays an important role in bacterial adhesion to lenses. adhesion of hydrophobic p. aeruginosa #3 was more tenacious than of hydrophilic s. aureus 799.
evaluation of extracts of the root of landolphia owerrience for antibacterial activity.
ethanolic and aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of landolphia owerrience root parts (whole-root, root-bark and root-wood) were tested for activity against ten bacterial strains using agar-well diffusion and macro-broth dilution methods, respectively. the ethanolic extracts of the whole-root and root-wood were active against 100 and 80% of the test organisms, respectively. ethanolic and aqueous extracts of the root-bark were moderately active while the aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of the root-wood exhibited little or no activity. out of the nine extracts prepared, 66.7% were active against staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600, 55.6% variously against each of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 10145 and local clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, escherichia coli and salmonella typhi, 44.4% against proteus sp., 33.3% against bacillus subtilis atcc 6051 and 22.2% against e. coli atcc 11775. the agar-well-determined mic values for the ethanolic whole-root extract (0.78-50 mg/ml) were higher (indicating lower activity) than the corresponding macro-broth-determined values (0.39-50 mg/ml) probably because of slow diffusion rates of the active constituents of the extract in agar. on the other hand, the differences could be due to the effects of dmso used to dissolve the ethanolic extracts in the agar-well diffusion tests. similar discrepancies in the mic values detectable with the two test methods were apparent in the root-wood extract and the control drug, gentamycin, except that in the latter the agar-well-determined mic values (0.125-8.0 microg/ml) were lower than the macro-broth-determined values (0.125-64 microg/ml). the strong activity of the ethanolic extracts against known etiologic agents of diseases traditionally treated with l. owerrience root of similar preparations provides scientific justification for the use of the herb in ethnomedical practice in nigeria.
[nationwide sensitivity surveillance of various antibiotic activities against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections].
the susceptibility of 3,058 bacterial strains isolated between january and march, 1997 from patients with severe infections in japan to ciprofloxacin and other injectable antimicrobial agents was measured using broth microdilution method. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains were generally sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin and arbekacin, and resistant to cpfx and other antibacterial agents. mic90 of cpfx against streptococcus pneumoniae, to which mic of ampicillin was more than 4 micrograms/ml, was below 2 micrograms/ml. prsp (penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae), which was also resistant to cephalosporins and carbapenems, showed no cross-resistance to cpfx. the susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to cpfx was as high as that to carbapenems. especially, mic90 against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 micrograms/ml. 3 strains of isolated 446 p. aeruginosa strains had blaimp gene. cpfx and pazufloxacin demonstrated good susceptibility with 0.25 microgram/ml of mic to 2 strains of these 3 strains. the susceptibility rate of the most common isolates from patients suffering from lower respiratory tract infections excluding mrsa to cpfx was more than 80% (indication: % strains < pneumonia break point).
in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.
an in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
objective: to evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. study design: cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group b streptococcus and escherichia coli. results: in the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus, e coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. in the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group b streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/ml of gentamicin and toward e coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/ml of gentamicin. conclusion: a low-molecular substance with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1999)].
from october 1999 to september 2000, we collected the specimen from 430 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 17 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 515 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 506 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 78, streptococcus pneumoniae 101, haemophilus influenzae 104, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 58, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 41, klebsiella pneumoniae 18, etc. of 78 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or above of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 57.7%. vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against mrsa without detection of abk-resistant strain (mic: 64 micrograms/ml) and decrease of vcm-sensitive strains those were found in 1998. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) decreased to 34.7% from 46.0% in 1998. the frequency of prsp was 3.0%, being the least number after 1991. carbapenems showed strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 101 strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. generally, all drugs showed strong activities against h. influenzae with mic80s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. mics of ofloxacin ranged between 0.063 microgram/ml and 4 micrograms/ml in 1998, however, those were 0.125 microgram/ml or below in all h. influenzae in 1999 showing the strongest activity. tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed strong activities against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. number of isolated p. aeruginosa (mucoid) was little as 11, however, the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except for ampicillin with decreasing of low-sensitive strains compared to those detected in 1998. also, all drugs generally showed strong activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml or below. the drug which showed the strongest activity was imipenem inhibiting all 41 strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. on the patients' characteristics, the number of patients aged 80 years or older who had been increased was decreased in 1999 in the distribution by age. the percentage of the elderly patients aged 70 years or older was 47.0%, which occupied almost a half number of the total patients as in the last year. as for the incidence by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest. they were noted in 37.9% and 30.5% of the patients, respectively. in 1999, bronchial asthma was frequently observed as compared in recent years. it was noted in about 10% of the patients which is the same % as in bronchiectasis. we examined the number of strains from these patients with infections before and after administration of antibiotics. in patients with bacterial pneumonia, the number of isolated strains was almost the same between those before and after administration. however, in patients with chronic bronchitis, the number of strains remarkably decreased to less than the half of the total after administration of antibiotics in the last year, but it decreased to 2/3 of the total in 1999. on the administration of antibiotics and isolated bacteria by the day of administration, the bacteria which were isolated more before administration were h. influenzae in 28.4%, s. pneumoniae in 25.7%, m. (b.) catarrhalis in 12.0% and s. aureus in 10.6%. the frequency of s. aureus after administration over 15 days was almost the same as that before administration, but the frequency of p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was 36.8% which was higher than that before administration. the frequency of isolated s. pneumoniae was decreased after administration and none of them was isolated after completion of administration. however, that of h. influenzae was decreased to 7.1% after administration within 3 days, and many h. influenzae were isolated after completion of administration as 21.4%.
antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
the bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of august 1999 to july 2000. then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined and the results were compared with those obtained between 1991 and 1998. comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those with uncomplicated utis and those with complicated utis (including with or without indwelling catheter). about e. faecalis, increase of low sensitive strains noted in the former year showed a decreasing tendency, however, one strain each with mic of 4 micrograms/ml to vancomycin (vcm) was detected in patients with both uncomplicated and complicated utis. as for s. aureus, many sensitive strains to cephems, imipenem (ipm) and vcm were noted, and each mic50 was better than that in the former years. s. aureus strains showing low susceptibility to arbekacin (abk) were detected in patients with complicated utis in this year as well as in the former year, and one strain each with mic of 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml was detected. susceptibilities of e. coli were effective to all drugs except for penicillins and minocycline (mino). decrease of low sensitive strains was also noted in all drugs except for quinolones. each mic90 of ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and sparfloxacin (spfx) in patients with complicated utis against e. coli was 3 degrees classes lower than that in patients with uncomplicated utis. as for klebsiella pneumoniae, decrease of low sensitive strains to cephems was noted in patients with uncomplicated utis in 1998. in 1999, low sensitive strains decreased also in patients with complicated utis, and few were detected. susceptibilities of k. pneumoniae to quinolones were effective as compared with those in the former years with the mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below without detection of low sensitive strains. one low sensitive strain of k. pneumoniae with mic of 8 micrograms/ml was detected for gentamicin (gm). susceptibilities of p. aeruginosa to carbapenems were notable. the mic90 of meropenem (mepm) and ipm was 4 micrograms/ml each which was 2 degrees better than that in 1998. resistant p. aeruginosa strains to other drugs except for monobactams decreased in 1999.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). ii. background of patients].
five-hundred forty four bacterial strains isolated from 412 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of august 1999 to july 2000. then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of isolation of bacteria by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of administration of antibiotics, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. about the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of male patients aged less than 50 years was few, and complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent. in females, the number of patients aged less than 20 years was few. complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent among female patients aged between 40 to 59 years, in other age groups, uncomplicated utis was most frequent. as for type of infections and kind of bacteria, escherichia coli decreased when the infections became complicated, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis increased when the infection became complicated. considering this result by age of patients, isolation frequency of e. coli was gradually decreased with aging in patients aged more than 20 years with uncomplicated utis or complicated utis without indwelling catheter. the isolation frequencies of e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus were gradually increased with aging in complicated utis without indwelling catheter. in patients with complicated utis with indwelling catheter, there was no difference between age group, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated. as for type of causative organisms in utis before and after the administration of antibiotics, the isolation of bacteria was remarkably decreased after administration in patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis without indwelling catheter. e. coli decreased after administration of antibiotics, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis increased after administration in patients with all infections. as for type of causative organisms in utis and surgical procedures, e. coli were more frequently isolated in patients with uncomplicated utis when surgical procedures were experienced. also, klebsiella spp. and e. faecalis were more frequently isolated in patients with surgical procedures. however, in complicated utis, type of causative organisms had no relationship with surgical procedures.
antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from cinnamomum osmophloeum.
the antibacterial activities of the essential oils from leaves of two cinnamomum  osmophloeum clones (a and b) and their chemical constituents were investigated in this study. the nine strains of bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella sp., and vibrio parahemolyticus, were used in the antibacterial tests. results from the antibacterial tests demonstrated that the indigenous cinnamon b leaf essential oils had an excellent inhibitory effect. the mics (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of the b leaf oil were 500 microg/ml against both k. pneumoniae and salmonella sp. and 250 microg/ml against the other seven strains of bacteria. cinnamaldehyde possessed the strongest antibacterial activity compared to the other constituents of the essential oils. the mics of cinnamaldehyde against the e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, mrsa, k. pneumoniae, salmonella sp., and v. parahemolyticus were 500, 1000, 250, 250, 250, 250, 1000, 500, and 250 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that c. osmophloeum leaf essential oil and cinnamaldehyde are beneficial to human health, having the potential to be used for medical purposes and to be utilized as anti-bacterial additives in making paper products.
diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis.
acute osteomyelitis is the clinical term for a new infection in bone. this infection occurs predominantly in children and is often seeded hematogenously. in adults, osteomyelitis is usually a subacute or chronic infection that develops secondary to an open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue. the specific organism isolated in bacterial osteomyelitis is often associated with the age of the patient or a common clinical scenario (i.e., trauma or recent surgery). staphylococcus aureus is implicated in most patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli are commonly isolated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. for optimal results, antibiotic therapy must be started early, with antimicrobial agents administered parenterally for at least four to six weeks. treatment generally involves evaluation, staging, determination of microbial etiology and susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy and, if necessary, debridement, dead-space management and stabilization of bone.
potential impact of the vitek 2 system and the advanced expert system on the clinical laboratory of a university-based hospital.
a study was designed to assess the impact of the vitek 2 automated system and the advanced expert system (aes) on the clinical laboratory of a typical university-based hospital. a total of 259 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates of enterobacteriaceae members, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were collected and tested by the vitek 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and the results were analyzed by the aes. the results were also analyzed by a human expert and compared to the aes analyses. among the 259 isolates included in this study, 245 (94.6%) were definitively identified by vitek 2, requiring little input from laboratory staff. for 194 (74.9%) isolates, no inconsistencies between the identification of the strain and the antimicrobial susceptibility determined by vitek 2 were detected by the aes. thus, no input from laboratory staff was required for these strains. the aes suggested one or more corrections to results obtained with 65 strains to remove inconsistencies. the human expert thought that most of these corrections were appropriate and that some resulted from a failure of the vitek 2 system to detect certain forms of resistance. antimicrobial phenotypes assigned to the strains by the aes for beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, and glycopeptides were similar to those assigned by the human expert for 95.7 to 100% of strains. these results indicate that the vitek 2 system and aes can provide accurate information in tests for most of the clinical isolates examined and remove the need for human analysis of results for many. certain problems were identified in the study that should be remediable with further work on the software supporting the aes.
activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of a new carbapenem, e1010, and tentative disc diffusion test interpretative criteria.
the susceptibility of 705 bacterial isolates representing 46 different species to e1010 (er-35786), imipenem, meropenem and cefepime was determined by the nccls broth microdilution test. the mic(90)s for e1010 were < or =1.0 mg/l for enterobacteriaceae, fastidious gram-negative bacteria, streptococci and anaerobes. e1010 was two- to four-fold more active than imipenem and meropenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four-fold more active than the other carbapenems against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin-resistant enterococci and most enterococcus faecium were resistant to all four drugs tested. the nccls disc diffusion test was performed simultaneously on the non-fastidious organisms. assuming the mic breakpoints for e1010 will be the same as for the other carbapenems, the disc diffusion zone diameter breakpoints of imipenem and meropenem would also be applicable to e1010.
synthesis of some benzimidazole derivatives and their antibacterial and antifungal activities.
a number of new benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized by the reaction of benzimidazole with appropriate alkyl halides. the compounds synthesized were intensified by 1h-nmr, fourier transformation infrared (ft-ir) and micro analysis. all new and related compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains: enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853) and the yeasts candida albicans and candida tropicalis. eleven of the compounds were found effective to inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis and s. aureus) at mic values between 12.5-400 micrograms/ml. none of the compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (e. coli and p. aeruginosa) at the concentrations studied (6.25-800 micrograms/ml). all compounds (except compound 3) were significantly effective against c. tropicalis with mic values of 6.25-400 micrograms/ml. eight of the tested compounds showed an antifungal activity against c. albicans with a range of the mics between 50 and 400 micrograms/ml.
synergy between staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a rat model of complex orthopaedic wounds.
background: we observed an interaction in animals inoculated concomitantly with staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa during a study of the efficacy of surfactants for disinfection of orthopaedic wounds. this led us to investigate whether synergy could be demonstrated between staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a rat model of complex orthopaedic wounds. methods: a wire was implanted into the spinous process of a lumbar vertebra of sprague-dawley rats through a dorsal incision. animals were divided into two groups: group one was inoculated with either staphylococcus aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group two received a polymicrobial inoculation with both test organisms in varying concentrations. after inoculation, the wounds were irrigated and closed. on postoperative day 14, all animals were killed and specimens from the wounds were cultured. the number of colony-forming units (cfu) of staphylococcus aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa needed to cause infection in 50% of the animals (id50) was determined with use of the reed-muench method. the infection rate associated with each inoculum combination was calculated, and the two groups were compared. results: the id50 was 2.8 x 10(4) cfu for staphylococcus aureus and 4.8 x 10(5) cfu for pseudomonas aeruginosa. the combination of 10(3) cfu of staphylococcus aureus with low concentrations (10(2), 10(3), or 10(4) cfu) of pseudomonas aeruginosa yielded infection rates that were higher than those found with either organism alone at the same concentrations. the combination of 10(3) cfu of staphylococcus aureus and 10(3) cfu of pseudomonas aeruginosa yielded a 75% infection rate, which was significantly higher (p = 0.004) than that associated with 10(3) cfu of either organism alone. as the pseudomonas aeruginosa concentration was increased (to 10(5), 10(6), and 10(7) cfu), this trend reversed, and the infection rate decreased to 33% (p = 0.004). low concentrations of pseudomonas aeruginosa (0 to 10(5) cfu) combined with 10(6) cfu of staphylococcus aureus yielded infection rates ranging from 83% to 100%. at the higher concentrations of pseudomonas aeruginosa (10(6) and 10(7) cfu), however, the infection rate again decreased, to 33% (p = 0.005). only staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the cultures of the specimens from the animals that had received a polymicrobial inoculum. conclusions: synergy between staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa was demonstrated when low levels of each organism were present in the wound. as the pseudomonas aeruginosa concentration was increased, the infection rates fell well below what would be anticipated, suggesting that low concentrations of pseudomonas aeruginosa enhance the ability of staphylococcus aureus to cause infection in this orthopaedic wound model. at the same time, the presence of staphylococcus aureus in the ratios tested decreased the rate of infection by pseudomonas aeruginosa. clinical relevance: staphylococcus aureus is a pathogen commonly seen in orthopaedic patients. the pathogenicity of staphylococcus aureus was shown to be increased in the presence of anaerobic bacteria. this study is the first one that we are aware of that demonstrated synergy between staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, at low concentrations, in a wound model while at the same time showing that staphylococcus aureus lowers the rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4-pyrrolidinylthio carbapenems part iv. 2-alkyl substituents containing cationic heteroaromatics linked via a c-c bond.
the synthesis and biological activity of a novel series of 2-alkyl-4-pyrrolidinylthio-beta-methylcarbapenems containing a variety of cationic heteroaromatic substituents linked via a c-c bond is described. as a result of these studies, we selected fr21818 (in) as a candidate compound for development. fr21818 exhibited a well balanced spectrum of antibacterial activity, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), excellent urinary recovery, good stability against renal dehydropeptidase-i (dhp-i). no antigenicity and mutagenicity, weak toxicities, and good efficacy and therapeutic effect on mice systemic infections. affinities to pbp's, permeability of outer membrane, and plasma levels in mice, dog, and cynomolgous monkey of fr21818 are also reported.
in vitro activities of three nonfluorinated quinolones against representative bacterial isolates.
in vitro susceptibility tests were performed to document the inhibitory activities of three nonfluorinated quinolone (nfq) compounds (pge 9262932, pge 9509924, and pge 4175997) compared to those of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin against 3,030 bacterial isolates. the spectra of the nfq agents included most gram-positive species as well as quinolone-susceptible enterobacteriaceae. ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were inhibited by the nfq series at < or =1.0 microg/ml. the nfq compounds were not very active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and most other nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. against other species, the potency of the nfq agents was similar to that of trovafloxacin. continued investigation of the nfq compounds seems to be warranted.
buchu (agathosma betulina and a. crenulata, rutaceae) essential oils: their pharmacological action on guinea-pig ileum and antimicrobial activity on microorganisms.
the mode of action of essential oils from two buchu species (agathosma betulina and a. crenulata, rutaceae) from the cape region of south africa has been studied on smooth muscle in-vitro using guinea-pig ileum. at high concentration, the oils had an initial spasmogenic activity followed by spasmolysis. the spasmolytic action was post-synaptic, not atropine-like and did not involve adrenoceptor or guanylyl cyclase activation. in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram, the spasmolytic action of a. betulina was significantly increased whilst that due to a. crenulata was also increased but not to a significant level. these results suggested a mode of action for the oils involving cyclic adenosine monophosphate. in addition, a. betulina appeared to block calcium channels but this was not seen with a. crenulata, possibly because the initial spasmogenic activity complicated the study of its spasmolytic action. neither essential oil (10 microl, undiluted) demonstrated antimicrobial action against enterococcus hirae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but very low activity was observed against escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and staphylococcus aureus, suggesting little potential for these oils as antimicrobial agents/preservatives.
antibacterial effects of trisubstituted quinazoline derivatives.
five trisubstituted quinazolones and eight trisubstituted quinazoline-4-thiones have been tested for antibacterial effects by a microdilution method. four derivatives exerted a significant effect on e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and b. subtilis (ic50 < 100 mg/l). in the bacterium p. aeruginosa six quinazolines showed a higher antibacterial effect than ampicillin. the most sensitive to the effects of the quinazolines was s. aureus; a concentration of 100 mg/l of six derivatives induced a bacteriostatic effect on s. aureus. the quinazoline-4-thiones were generally more active than the quinazolones. all the tested concentrations of the four most effective quinazolines influenced the specific growth rate.
synthesis of mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
5-phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. the structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (ir, 1h-nmr, eims) methods. the antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans atcc 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found to be active against s. aureus atcc 6538 (mic: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/ml respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against s. flexneri (mic: both 312.5 micrograms/ml). the minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.
trauma, head injury, and neurosurgery infections.
patients with multiple trauma and head injuries are high-risk populations for developing nosocomial infections, which are the first cause of death after 3 weeks of admission. pneumonia caused by methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus is the most frequent infection in patients with a decreased level of consciousness. nevertheless, after 7 days of ventilation, pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most frequently isolated microorganism in ventilator-associated pneumonia. central nervous system infections represent only 4% of those experienced by trauma patients; however, if cerebrospinal fluid (csf) leakage exists, the incidence increases to 50%. the diagnosis of meningitis is difficult because csf biochemical data are not specific. patients with spinal cord injuries are at greater risk for developing infections caused by multiresistant microorganisms because of their prolonged hospital stay.
[diagnostic value of a novel nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of pathogens causing enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis].
a new nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of the causative agents of enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis was found to have advantages over endo medium in its differentiating and inhibiting properties. this medium permitted the easy differentiation of yersinia pseudotuberculosis from y. enterocolitica, as well as from escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. rhinoscleromatis, hafnia, enterobacter and citrobacter by color; from proteus inconstans by swarming. in addition, weakly swarming of p. vulgaris differed by their light bluish color and pseudomonas aeruginosa, by the brilliance and size of colonies. endo medium could be used only for differentiation of e. coli from lactose-negative yersinia colonies, klebsiella (by mucous growth) and, to a certain extent, all proteus species (by swarming). the medium under test and the control medium inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus. in contrast to endo medium, the medium under test partially inhibited the growth of k. rhinoscleromatis and the swarming of p. inconstans. the new medium is now introduced into practice.
antimicrobial use and susceptibility rates in isolates from intensive care unit and other nosocomial inpatient and outpatient areas.
our objective was to evaluate the relation between antimicrobial use and susceptibility in the intensive care unit (icu) and non-icu inpatient areas in the bolzano regional hospital. for the isolates of s. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococcus sp., p. aeruginosa and e. coli we found a pattern of significant stepwise decrease in the frequency of antimicrobial susceptibility to penicilloic beta-lactam antibiotics and first generation cephalosporins; the highest senitivity rates occurred among isolates from outpatients, followed in decreasing order by rates among isolates from non-icu inpatients and from icu-patients; the rate of use of this group of antimicrobial agents was relatively high in the intensive care unit (13,1%). for p. aeruginosa we observed significantly lower susceptibility-rates to second, third and fourth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and monobactams for non-icu inpatient areas than for outpatient or icu areas; this paralleled with the low use of this group of agents in the icu area (4,9%). also, for p. aeruginosa the prevalence of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin in inpatient areas was lower than in the outpatient or icu-areas; the rate of quinolone-use was relatively low in the icu area (4,2%).
isolation and bioactivities of epidioxysterol from the tunicate cynthia savignyi.
from a hexane extract of the tunicate cynthia savignyi, collected in morocco, epidioxysterol or 5,8-alpha-epidioxy-5alpha-cholest-6-en-3beta-ol has been isolated. this is the first example of epidioxysterol found in the tunicate c. savignyi. the structure of epidioxysterol has been characterised by nmr data (1h, 13c and 2d). epidioxysterol possesses antifungal activity against three tomato pathogenic fungi: botrytis cinerea, fusarium oxysporum and verticillium albo atrum and antibacterial activity against agrobacterium tumefaciens, escherichia coli, staphylococcusfaecalis, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa and cytotoxicity against artemia salina larvae.
in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
the antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (ah plus, sealapex, ketac endo, and fill canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (calen and calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 10541. there was a wild strain of streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with brain heart infusion agar and muller hinton medium seeded by pour plate. calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% ttc gel and inhibition haloes were measured. all bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. however, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by ah plus, fill canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. we conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% ttc gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
evaluation of a selective broth for detection of staphylococcus aureus using impedance microbiology.
experiments were conducted to evaluate a selective nutrient broth containing acriflavine and nalidixic acid for detection of staphylococcus aureus using an impedance microbiological method. nine species of bacteria, other than s. aureus, were evaluated using the selective broth to determine if these species could be inhibited. a total of 10 ppm of nalidixic acid inhibited the gram-negative species tested, with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa. similarly, 10 ppm of acriflavine suppressed the staphylococcus spp. examined; however, s. aureus retained the ability to proliferate. nutrient broth solution containing 10 ppm of nalidixic acid and 10 ppm of acriflavine (s. aureus impedance broth [sib]) inhibited multiplication of most of the bacterial species tested and allowed s. aureus to be detected in an average of 16.4 h. fresh chicken carcass rinses and cooked chicken rinses were inoculated with escherichia coli and s. aureus and assayed using sib in conjunction with impedance. results demonstrated that s. aureus could be detected in less than 11.5 h, although the presence of e. coli decreased detection times. additionally, impedance assays were conducted using five different poultry products to evaluate the sensitivity of the broth for detecting s. aureus. s. aureus could be detected on poultry products when present at low levels (10(1) cfu/ml) in less than 24 h. these studies demonstrated that sib may be used in conjunction with impedance for rapid detection of s. aureus. however, without further modification, this method should not be used for enumeration of s. aureus from samples containing mixed microflora.
[antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides in human parotid saliva].
two ultrasensitive antibacterial assays were applied to determine the antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides (hrps) in human parotid saliva. the results not only confirmed the potent antibacterial activity of hrps against streptococcus mutans mt6r, but also showed for the first time that hrps were effectively antibacterial to staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli ml-35p and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853. among hrps, hrp3, hrp5 and hrp6 were the major antibacterial components which were active against s. mutans, s. aureus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, whereas hrp1 was only effective against e. coli. s. sanguis was resistant to the action of hrps. these results suggest that hrps are actually a family of endogenous antibiotic peptides with broad antimicrobial spectrum including fungi, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and may play an important role in the prevention of various infection diseases in the oral cavity as well as in the resistance to caries.
in vitro and in vivo properties of ro 63-9141, a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
ro 63-9141 is a new member of the pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem series of  cephalosporins. its antibacterial spectrum was evaluated against significant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in comparison with those of reference drugs, including cefotaxime, cefepime, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. ro 63-9141 showed high antibacterial in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria except ampicillin-resistant enterococci, particularly vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium. its mic at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)) for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was 4 microg/ml. ro 63-9141 was bactericidal against mrsa. development of resistance to the new compound in mrsa was not observed. ro 63-9141 was more potent than cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) = 2 microg/ml). it was active against ceftazidime-susceptible strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and against enterobacteriaceae except proteus vulgaris and some isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. the basis for the antibacterial spectrum of ro 63-9141 lies in its affinity to essential penicillin-binding proteins, including pbp 2' of mrsa, and its stability towards beta-lactamases. the in vivo findings were in accordance with the in vitro susceptibilities of the pathogens. these data suggest the potential utility of ro 63-9141 for the therapy of infections caused by susceptible pathogens, including mrsa. since insufficient solubility of ro 63-9141 itself precludes parenteral administration in humans, a water-soluble prodrug, ro 65-5788, is considered for development.
antibacterial properties of human amnion and chorion in vitro.
objective: the purpose of the present study was to explore the direct effects of  amnion and chorion on bacterial growth in vitro including the antibacterial spectrum. chorioamniotic membranes were obtained under sterile conditions from 13 healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section at term. likewise, chorioamniotic membranes were obtained from 10 healthy women with spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. five strains of hemolytic streptococci group b (gbs) were tested and one clinical isolate of the following species or bacterial groups: hemolytic streptococcus group a, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and lactobacillus species. bacteriological media included (1) blood-agar medium; (2) a transparent agar medium for submerged cultures; and (3) a nutrient broth medium. results: an inhibitory effect of fetal membranes against a range of bacteria was found. consistent results were obtained in experiments with cultures on agar and cultures suspended in agar (membranes from eight women in both studies). in experiments with liquid cultures (seven women) only chorion showed a marginal inhibitory effect. all strains were inhibited, but the most pronounced inhibition was obtained for streptococcus group a, s. aureus and s. saprophyticus by both chorion and amnion. conclusion: this study demonstrated an inhibitory effect of the fetal membranes on a diverse panel of bacteria
[antimicrobial efficacy of a silver layer on hydrogel lenses] citation].
background: the high standard of hygiene required in using contact lenses requires regular sterilization, for which the application of a hydrogen peroxide system or storage in liquids containing antimicrobial agents are regarded as the most effective procedures. an approach to avoiding contamination could be to provide the lenses themselves with antimicrobial properties. for this purpose contact lenses equipped with a silver layer were examined for their effect on bacteria. materials and methods: the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver layer on weflex 55 hydrogellenses (watercontent 55%, nonionic) was investigated. the lenses were incubated at 37 degrees c for 1 h in suspensions (10(8) cfu/ml) with pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus and were rinsed afterwards. the detachment of the adherent bacteria took place by shaking the lenses in the presence of glass beads (diameter 0.5 mm). samples of these suspensions were taken, and microbial counts were performed before and after incubation of the contaminated lenses for 6 h and 24 h in a sterile solution of sodium chloride (0.9%, w/v). results: lenses with a silver layer showed markedly fewer test organisms than did unprepared lenses. however, this effect was detectable only when the contaminated lenses were kept in sodium chloride solution (0.9%) for several hours. after incubation for 67 at 25 degrees c the microbial numbers of p. aeruginosa were diminished by about 4 log steps, and those of s. aureus by about 1 log step. particularly in the case of p. aeruginosa the antimicrobial property of the silver layer was very effective. the microbial numbers of this species, which can cause serious infections of the eyes, were reduced after 24 h by more than 6 log steps. however, s. aureus showed a reduction of only 1.5 log steps. these results reflect the antimicrobial effect of silver ions which are dissolved from depots in the surfaces of the lenses only in traces because of their low dissolution properties. conclusions: these first investigations of preserved contact lenses indicate a new possibility for reducing lens-induced infections of the eyes. due to the weak efficacy against the gram-positive species s. aureus a silver layer probably cannot replace other sterilization procedures completely, but it may represent an additional protection from contamination. side effects to the eyes due to the negligible toxicity of oligodynamics silver concentrations, such are known to occur with high silver concentrations, should be not expected, but possible allergic reactions caused by the silver-ions should be investigated.
inhibition of neutrophil elastase prevents cathelicidin activation and impairs clearance of bacteria from wounds.
the host defense roles of neutrophil elastase in a porcine skin wound chamber model were explored. analysis of wound fluid by acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blot, and bacterial overlay confirmed that the neutrophil-derived protegrins constituted the major stable antimicrobial polypeptide in the wound fluid. the application to the wound of 0.10 and 0.25 mm n-methoxysuccinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-valine (aapv) chloromethyl ketone, a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor (nei), blocked the proteolytic activation of protegrins and diminished the associated antimicrobial activity as detected by radial diffusion assay against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans or by bacterial gel overlay against s epidermidis and e coli. the application of the related cathepsin g inhibitor (cgi), benzyloxycarbonyl-glycine-leucine-phenylalanine (zglf) chloromethyl ketone, had no effect. in wound chambers that received 10(6) colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml of s epidermidis, the presence of nei significantly decreased the 24-hour clearance of bacteria from the wound compared to wounds treated with cgi or solvent only. neither inhibitor, at 0.10 or 0.25 mm concentration, affected leukocyte accumulation or degranulation in the wound chambers. the in vitro microbicidal decrement due to nei was restored by an amount of the specific protegrin (pg-1), which was equivalent to the measured difference of protegrin between control and inhibited chambers. administration of 1 microg/ml exogenous pg-1 4 hours after chamber preparation was sufficient to normalize in vivo antimicrobial activity. although pharmacologic neis are promising candidates as anti-inflammatory drugs, they may impair host defense in part by inhibiting the activation of cathelicidins by neutrophil elastase.
assessment of the capacity of lactobacillus to inhibit the growth of uropathogens and block their adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells.
to gain insight into the mechanisms by which lactobacillus blocks the adherence of uropathogens to vaginal epithelial cells and inhibits their growth, 15 lactobacillus strains and 22 uropathogens were studied. lactobacilli from hemagglutination group iii, identified as lactobacillus crispatus, showed greater capacity to block uropathogen adherence than those from hemagglutination groups ii and i (61.9%, 49.5%, and 52.6% of blockage, respectively). pseudomonas aeruginosa pa5 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp7 were the uropathogens most susceptible to blockage, and staphylococcus aureus sa11 and proteus mirabilis pm1 were the most resistant. lactobacillus inhibited uropathogen growth better in liquid assays; the 3 lactobacillus groups showed similar inhibitory power (72.3%, 71.9%, and 74.2% of light transmittance). p. aeruginosa pa5 was the most inhibited, and enterococcus species e15 was the least inhibited. there is considerable variation among lactobacillus strains regarding their adherence to uroepithelium, blockage of uropathogen attachment, and inhibition of uropathogen growth. although these properties are independent, they may coincide and therefore allow for these strains to balance the vaginal ecosystem and to make them useful as probiotics.
assessment of in-vitro efficacy of 1% virkon against bacteria, fungi, viruses and spores by means of afnor guidelines.
peroxygenic acid, under the brand name virkon, has unleashed great debate following contradictory reports of its efficacy and spectrum of activity. the aim of this study was to test the biocidal activity of the compound against 10 different micro-organisms, following standard in-vitro test procedures. bactericidal, fungicidal and sporicidal activities were determined using quantitative suspension and germ carrier tests and virucidal activity was assessed using a simple dilution suspension test, following the association francaise de normalisation (afnor) guidelines. one percent virkon demonstrated bactericidal activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae and mycobacterium smegmatis in the suspension test and against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, s. aureus and e. hirae in the carrier test. one percent virkon showed virucidal activity against poliovirus in the suspension test. however, this concentration did not comply with sporicidal and fungicidal activity guidelines. in conclusion, 1% virkon is effective only against vegetative bacteria, yeasts and viruses, and should therefore be considered a low-level disinfectant.
[antibacterial activities of piperacillin for several resistant strains from respiratory infections--in reference to mrsa, prsp, blnar and p. aeruginosa].
we investigated antibacterial activities of piperacillin (pipc) for several resistant strains of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections from 1998 to 1999 in comparison with reference drugs and obtained the following results: 1. the majority of methicillin resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) showed high resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics including pipc. 2. mic90 of pipc was 1 and 4 micrograms/ml for penicillin intermediate and penicillin resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp/prsp), respectively. 3. mic90 of pipc was 0.25 microgram/ml for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae (blnar), showing higher antibacterial activity than the reference drugs. 4. pipc exhibited the mics of 8 micrograms/ml or less in 19 out of 40 ipm resistant (mic > or = 16 micrograms/ml) strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. from these results, pipc is proved to possess extremely favorable antibacterial activities for blnar, and it was suggested that pipc might be a drug of choice even for pisp/prsp and ipm resistant strains of p. aeruginosa.
ingested blood contributes to the specificity of the symbiosis of aeromonas veronii biovar sobria and hirudo medicinalis, the medicinal leech.
hirudo medicinalis, the medicinal leech, usually carries in its digestive tract a pure culture of aeromonas veronii bv. sobria. such specificity is unusual for digestive tracts that are normally colonized by a complex microbial consortium. important questions for the symbiotic interaction and for the medical application after microvascular surgery are whether other bacteria can proliferate or at least persist in the digestive tract of h. medicinalis and what factors contribute to the reported specificity. using a colonization assay, we were able to compare experimentally the ability of clinical isolates and of a symbiotic strain to colonize h. medicinalis. the symbiotic a. veronii bv. sobria strain proliferated well and persisted for at least 7 days inside the digestive tract. in contrast, the proliferation of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus was inhibited inside the animal compared to growth in the in vitro control, indicating that the ingested blood was modified within the digestive tract. however, both strains were able to persist in the digestive tract for at least 7 days. for an escherichia coli strain, the viable counts decreased approximately 1, 000-fold within 42 h. the decrease of viable e. coli could be prevented by interfering with the activation of the membrane-attack complex of the complement system that is present in blood. this suggests that the membrane-attack complex remained active inside h. medicinalis and prevented the proliferation of sensitive bacteria. thus, antimicrobial properties of the ingested vertebrate blood contribute to the specificity of the a. veronii-h. medicinalis symbiosis, in addition to modifications of the blood inside the digestive tract of h. medicinalis.
[sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
objective: the aim of this study, conducted in the french military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from nosocomial infection in intensive care units. patients and methods: a prospective study has been conducted from january to december 1998 in all the intensive care units of the french army. all the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie". results: a total of 849 strains are included in this study. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by escherichia coli (19%) staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (11%) and enterococci (7%). imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. resistance to iii generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blse) in 36% of cases. this blse could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. the most frequent species producing blse were enterobacter aerogenes (75% of blse) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). among the 172 p. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. seventy per cent of the 96 cons and 50.2% of the 126 s. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. a strain of s. aureus and 2 cons strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. twenty per cent of the 59 enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of e. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. one strain of e. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: the evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. high rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among p. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. the implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.
antimicrobial activity of extracts of eastern north american hardwood trees and relation to traditional medicine.
wood and bark extracts of 14 eastern north american hardwood tree species which were used traditionally as medicine by first nation's people were screened for antimicrobial activities with eight strains of bacteria and six strains of fungi. eighty-six percent of the bark extracts were active against methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus; 71% against bacillus subtilus and 79% against mycobacterium phlei. the bark extract of juglans cinerea was active against pseudomonas aeruginosa 187, salmonella typhiumurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the wood extracts were less active: 72% were active against s. aureus (methicillin-sensitive), 36% against b. subtilus and 43% against m. phlei. results from antifungal tests indicated that 36% of the extracts were active against at least one fungal strain and that bark extracts were more active than wood extracts. the bark extract from juglans cinerea had the broadest spectrum of activities against candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae, cryptococcus neoformans, trichophyton mentagrophytes, microsporum gypseum, and aspergillus fumigatus. in general, the extracts were more active against gram positive bacteria than gram negative bacteria and against filamentous fungi than yeast-like fungi. the study also demonstrated a correlation between frequency of traditional medicinal use by the first nations people and antimicrobial activity of extracts indicating that the traditional knowledge encompasses an understanding of aspects of chemical ecology.
design, synthesis, and sar of novel carbapenem antibiotics with high stability to xanthomonas maltophilia oxyiminocephalosporinase type ii.
racemic cis-6-(phenylacetamido)carbapenem (21), 2-hydroxycarbonyl-cis-6-(phenylacetamido)carbapenem (22), 2-methoxycarbonyl-cis-6-(phenylacetamido)carbapenem (30), 2-methoxycarbomethyl-cis-6-(phenylacetamido)carbapenem (33), 2-hydroxyethyl-cis-6-(phenylacetamido)carbapenem (34), and 2-acetoxyethyl-cis-6-(phenylacetamido)carbapenem (35) were synthesized. formation of the carbapenem nuclei in 21, 22, and 30 involved dehydrophosphonation of the corresponding 2-diphenylphosphono-6-(phenylacetamido)carbapenam precursors 14, 15, and 28 using trimethylsilyl triflate and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene in thf. syntheses of carbapenems 33-35 involved a wittig reaction of carbapenam 14 with methyl glyoxylate in the presence of lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine in thf. for the antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus fda 209p, s. aureus 95, escherichia coli atcc 39188, klebsiellapneumoniae nctc 418, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1101-75, and p. aeruginosa 18s-h, carbapenems (+/-)-21, (+/-)-22, (+/-)-30, and (+/-)-33-35 were found comparable with imipenem ((+)-3), yet they were notably more potent than (+)-3 against xanthomonas maltophilia gn 12873. on the other hand, unlike (+)-3, carbapenems (+/-)-21, (+/-)-22, (+/-)-30, and (+/-)-33-35 were stable to x. maltophilia oxyiminocephalosporinase type ii. their beta-lactamase inhibitory properties, however, were found to be more comparable with those of penicillin g ((+)-4) than to those of imipenem ((+)-3). a combination of imipenem ((+)-3) with (+/-)-21, (+/-)-22, (+/-)-30, and (+/-)-33-35 resulted in synergistic antibacterial activity against x. maltophilia gn 12873. results from the biological tests were correlated with the distribution of the electron density at c(2)=c(3) of carbapenems upon reaction with transpeptidases or beta-lactamases.
predominant staphylococcus aureus isolated from various skin diseases.
we examined predominant staphylococcus aureus isolated from lesions of various skin diseases, and during the past 3 years, 113 methicillin-sensitive and 31 methicillin-resistant s. aureus have been isolated. the predominant species isolated from almost all of the primary bacteriological cultures was s. aureus. the skin diseases from which cultures were most frequently prepared were atopic dermatitis, followed by ulcers. s. aureus was the predominant species in two-thirds or more of cases of all of the different skin diseases examined. the predominant species identified, other than s. aureus, included streptococcus species and pseudomonas aeruginosa. evaluation of the predominance of s. aureus is important to the determination of the severity of skin lesions and, if needed, appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
triphenyltin salicylate-antimicrobial effect and resistance--the pyrophosphatase  connection.
the effect of triphenyltin salicylate (tps) was tested against six bacteria, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi and five fungi, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus niger, rhodotorula spp. and saccharomyces spp. sensitivity tests were determined with 5-500 microg/ml of tps. all organisms were sensitive to the compound except klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, rhodotorula spp. and saccharomyces spp. the minimum dose of tps that can kill 50% of the susceptible microorganisms is in the range 5-50 microg/ml. membrane bound pyrophosphatase(s) from the organisms was non-competitively inhibited by 5 microm tps with ki values of 7.6, 18, 8.8 and 6.9 microm for escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, aspergillus niger, and aspergillus fumigatus, respectively. the physiological index of efficiency of the enzyme (vmax/km) for tps susceptible organisms was reduced by 17-68% in the presence of 5-10 microm of the compound. in contrast the index for the non-susceptible organisms was unaffected. the mode of action of tps is discussed.
rotation and restricted use of antibiotics in a medical intensive care unit. impact on the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
to test the hypothesis that a new program of antibiotic strategy control can minimize the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) caused by potentially antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, we performed a prospective before-after study in 3, 455 patients admitted to a single intensive care unit over a 4-yr period. regarding the bacterial ecology and the increasing antimicrobial resistance in our medical intensive care unit (micu), we decided to vary our choice of empiric and therapeutic antibiotic treatment, with a supervised rotation, and a restricted use of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin, which were widely prescribed before this scheduled change. for all patients, vap was diagnosed based on the results of quantitative culture of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens (>/= 10(4) cfu/ml). we studied 1,044 and 1,022 patients requiring more than 48 h of mechanical ventilation (mv), respectively, in the before-period (2 yr: 1995-1996) and the after-period (2 yr: 1997-1998). we observed a decrease from 231 consecutive episodes of vap in the before-period to 161 episodes of vap in the after-period (p < 0.01), particularly for vap occurring before 7 d of mv. the total number of potentially antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli responsible for vap such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, steno-trophomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter baumanii decreased from 140 to 79 isolated bacilli. the susceptibilities of these bacteria to the antibiotics regimen increased significantly, especially for p. aeruginosa and b. cepacia. the percentage of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus increased significantly from 40% to 60% of s. aureus responsible for vap. these results suggest that a new strategy of antibiotics use could be an efficient means to reduce the incidence of vap caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. nevertheless, further studies are needed to validate these data.
the lactoperoxidase system: the influence of iodide and the chemical and antimicrobial stability over the period of about 18 months.
the lactoperoxidase (lp) system is a natural antimicrobial system, the use of which has been suggested as a preservative in foods and pharmaceuticals. the effect of adding iodide to the lp system, the chemical stability and the change in antimicrobial effectiveness during storage was studied. addition of iodide with thiocyanate increased the fungicidal and bactericidal effect against candida albicans, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the same inhibition in the lp system with iodide and without iodide. storage of the lp system in completely filled airtight containers for 18 months caused a 35% loss of the initial thiocyanate concentration. the antimicrobial activity of this lp system was strong enough to kill inocula of 106 cfu ml-1 of the four test organisms within 2 h of contact time. during storage of the air-containing lp system, the concentration of thiocyanate was reduced below detection limit within 7 d, the concentrations of hypothiocyanite and hypoiodite within 350 d. after 516 d the antimicrobial activity of air-containing lp system was strong enough to kill inocula of 106 cfu ml-1 ps. aeruginosa within 2 h, staph. aureus within 4 h and candida albicans and e. coli within 1 week of contact time.
antimicrobial effects of novel siderophores linked to beta-lactam antibiotics.
as a strategy to increase the penetration of antibiotic drugs through the outer membrane of gram-negative pathogens, facilitated transport through siderophore receptors has been frequently exploited. hydroxamic acids, catechols, or very close isosteres of catechols, which are mimics of naturally occurring siderophores, have been used successfully as covalently linked escorting moieties, but a much wider diversity of iron binding motifs exists. this observation, coupled to the relative lack of specificity of siderophore receptors, prompted us to initiate a program to identify novel, noncatechol siderophoric structures. we screened over 300 compounds for their ability to (1) support growth in low iron medium of a pseudomonas aeruginosa siderophore biosynthesis deletion mutant, or (2) compete with a bactericidal siderophore-antibiotic conjugate for siderophore receptor access. from these assays we identified a set of small molecules that fulfilled one or both of these criteria. we then synthesized these compounds with functional groups suitable for attachment to both monobactam and cephalosporin core structures. siderophore-beta-lactam conjugates then were tested against a panel of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus strains. although several of the resultant chimeric compounds had antimicrobial activity approaching that of ceftazidime, and most compounds demonstrated very potent activity against their cellular targets, only a single compound was obtained that had enhanced, siderophore-mediated antibacterial activity. results with tonb mutants frequently showed increased rather than decreased susceptibilities. suggesting that multiple factors influenced the intracellular concentration of the drugs.
impact of quantitative invasive diagnostic techniques in the management and outcome of mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia.
objective: to assess how data obtained by invasive diagnostic techniques may affect management and outcome of patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap), in comparison with noninvasive qualitative techniques. design: prospective study. setting: an 18-bed medical and surgical intensive care unit. patients: a total of 91 patients suspected of having vap were randomized into two groups. in group a (n = 45), quantitative cultures obtained by either bronchoscopic or nonbronchoscopic techniques were performed, whereas in group b (n = 43), patients were treated based on clinical judgment and nonquantitative tracheal aspirates cultures. three patients were excluded because of the absence of follow-up. results: in patients with positive cultures, therapeutic changes were made in 20 patients. in four patients (three from group a and one from group b, p = ns), initial empirical antibiotic treatment was modified because the isolated microorganisms were not susceptible (all of them had late-onset pneumonia). the isolated organisms responsible for antibiotic modifications were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (three patients) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (one patient). in three patients, the antimicrobial therapy was considered inappropriate because the isolated microorganisms were multiresistant and treated with only one effective antibiotic. in 13 patients (ten from group a and three from group b, p < .05), treatment was changed to select a narrower spectrum antibiotic. no therapeutic modifications were made in patients with negative cultures based on the results of quantitative cultures. the overall mortality was 22.2% in group a and 20.9% in group b. there were no differences in intensive care unit stay or days of mechanical ventilation (23.67+/-3.15 vs. 22.42+/-3.01 and 19.99+/-2.88 vs. 19.24+/-3.04, respectively). conclusions: in our study population, the routine use of quantitative invasive diagnostic tools is not justified in the setting of ventilated patients clinically suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia.
[the antagonistic activity of the eubiotic maxilin towards wound infection and its effect on the antibiotic resistance of microorganisms].
antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria of strain n 2585 of "maxilin" probiotic in respect to the strains s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, e. coli, candida albicans and their effect on the level of sustainability of the antibiotic resistant strains s. aureus, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, which are extracted from the patients with open fractures of the mandible under various course of wound process, have been studied. the studies showed that lactic acid bacteria have suppressed growth of strains candida most actively, followed by p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and e. coli. the use of "maxilin" probiotic allowed reducing the epidemiological significance of pathogenetic strains already in 3 to 4 days. the sensibility studies showed high activity of the lactic acid bacteria in reducing antibiotic resistance of the strains investigated. it was revealed that "maxilin" probiotic affects ps. aeruginosa effectively, somewhat less st. aureus and e. coli. the extracted strains demonstrated sensibility to all investigated antibiotics already in 3 to 4 days.
[results of antimicrobial susceptibilities of strains clinically isolated at 8 institutions in hiroshima city to major oral antimicrobial drugs, mainly new quinolone drugs. hiroshima levofloxacin susceptibility surveillance group].
to evaluate the resistance for major oral antimicrobial agents, mainly new quinolones, we carried out a drug susceptibility surveillance of 3,050 strains of 11 microbial species clinically isolated at 8 institutions such as general hospitals and examination centers in hiroshima city. 10 antimicrobial agents were used: 3 new quinolone drugs, 5 beta-lactam drugs, minocycline and clarithromycin. among gram-positive bacteria, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecalis showed low susceptibility to the new quinolone drugs, while methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive to these drugs. among gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa showed high resistance for the new quinolone drugs, but enteric bacteria and haemophilus influenzae did not show marked resistance, maintaining almost good sensitivity to these drugs. to reduce the appearance of resistant bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial agents should be selected. drug susceptibility surveillance in the community will be also important in the future.
basis for nebulized antibiotics: droplet characterization and in vitro antimicrobial activity versus staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the aims of this study were to (1) quantify the particle size characteristics of  several antibiotics considered suitable for aerosol therapy after aerosolization with the pari is/2 nebulizer (pari gmbh, sarnberg, germany) and (2) determine the degree to which in vitro antimicrobial activity of these antibiotics is maintained after nebulization. the aerosolized drugs were tobramycin sulfate, streptomycin, and imipenem, with saline solution as the control. mean mass aerodynamic diameter of the nebulized drugs was 3.25 microns for tobramycin, 2.26 microns for imipenem, and 2.38 microns for streptomycin. in vitro tests showed that tobramycin and imipenem were unaltered in their bacteriostatic activity against strains of escherichia coli (american type culture collection [atcc] 25922) and staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213) as well as against pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853) with minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values less than 0.3 microgram/ml. nebulized streptomycin showed significantly higher mic values against p. aeruginosa (atcc 27853). these results suggest that tobramycin and imipenem may be prescribed as an aerosol generated by jet nebulization (pari is/2) to treat s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa infections without any risk of altering the drugs minimum bacteriostatic activity by the nebulization process. aerosolization of streptomycin with this nebulizer may not be as effective against p. aeruginosa because it seems to alter the bacteriostatic activity.
binding kinetics of triclosan (irgasan) to alloplastic vascular grafts: an in vitro study.
the aim of this study was to investigate the binding kinetics of triclosan (irgasan) to alloplastic vascular grafts and to examine its antimicrobial activity against various microbial pathogens in vitro. vascular grafts made by intergard (intervascular), fluoropassiv (vascutek), and gore-tex (gore) were examined. grafts were incubated in 10 g/l triclosan (irgasan), dried, sterilized, and incubated in rpmi medium. one-centimeter segments of the grafts were resected under sterile conditions at intervals of minutes, then hours, followed by days and up to 4 weeks. samples were stored frozen at -20 degrees c for the measurement of triclosan bound to the vascular graft by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). the binding kinetics under perfusion conditions were determined for intergard grafts, which were perfused with 50 ml of nutrient medium for 24 hr. samples were taken at various time intervals for the measurement of triclosan. the antimicrobial activity of triclosan against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans as well as enterococcus faecium was determined. triclosan effectively binds to vascular graft without the use of intermediate binding substances. it stayed on the graft for the duration of 4 weeks. under both static and perfusion conditions, the binding kinetics are similar. triclosan binds most effectively to intergard grafts, less so to fluoropassiv grafts, and not at all to gore-tex material. antimicrobial activity of triclosan is very effective against s. aureus and e. faecium but not against p. aeruginosa.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(alpha-haloacyl)amino] thiazoles and 5-nonsubstituted/substituted 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones.
4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(chloroacetyl/alpha-chloropropionyl/al pha- bromobutyryl/alpha-chloro-(alpha-phenylacetyl)amino]thiazoles (i-iv) were synthesized by reacting 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-aminothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride, alpha-chloropropionyl chloride, alpha-bromobutyryl bromide and alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl chloride, respectively. furthermore, i-iv were refluxed with ammonium thiocyanate to give 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (v-viii). v was refluxed with various aromatic aldehydes to give 5-arylidene-2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-t hiazolidinones (ix-xiv). the structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, hydrolysis, uv, ir, 1h-nmr and ei mass spectral data. the antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by microbroth dilution technique using mueller-hinton broth and mueller-hinton agar. in this study, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis and candida albicans atcc 10231 were used as test microorganisms. among the tested compounds, xi and xiv showed activity against s. aureus (mic: 78 micrograms/ml, 1.6 micrograms/ml), whereas compound v had an activity against s. flexneri (mic: 39 micrograms/ml) and compound i against c. albicans (mic: 125 (micrograms/ml). compounds i, iv-xiv were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv using the bactec 460 radiometric system and bactec 12b medium. only compounds i and xiv showed 86% and 67% inhibition in the primary screen.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1998)].
the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 18 institutions around the entire japan, 532 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 438 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1998 to september in 1999. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 85 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 96 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 75 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 6 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 38 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 26 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of 517 strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 60.0%. vancomycin (vcm) and arbekacin (abk) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. but one of mrsa showed resistance to abk with the mic of 64 micrograms/ml. the sensitive strains of mrsa to vcm have decreased. the frequency of penicillin (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) + pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) have increased in 46.0% for 1998 comparatively from 30.9% of 1997's. but prsp decreased, and pisp increased into 39.0% of 1998 years from 19.8% of 1997's. panipenem (papm), imipenem (ipm) and faropenem (frpm) showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. against h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis, almost all the drugs showed good activities. the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) decreased in 1997, but those have increased in 1998. inversely, the susceptibility of them against cefotiam (ctm) had been higher in 1997, but those have been lower in 1998. tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and nonmucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were active against k. pneumoniae. a quite few of k. pneumoniae showed low susceptibilities. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 48.6% of all the patients showing a slight increase in every year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases as follows: bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent with 40.2%. the ratio of it has increased slightly, and the increased rate was 10% in patients with ages over 70 years compared with the results in 1997. chronic bronchitis have decreased slightly with 27.6% in 1998. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these were almost same number in bacterial pneumonia. administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 26.7%, h. influenzae 23.8%, s. aureus 13.3% and m. (b.) catarrhalis 10.8%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 45.5% after administration over 15 days. the frequencies of s. pneumoniae decreased upon administration of antibiotics, these were only 4.5% over 15 days. the frequencies of h.

objective: to study the distribution, current trends, and patterns of resistance  to antimicrobial agents of bacterial keratitis isolates in south florida. design: retrospective, observational, case series. participants: the microbiology records of all patients with bacterial keratitis seeking treatment at the bascom palmer eye institute from january 1, 1990 through december 31, 1998 were reviewed. main outcome measures: in vitro laboratory minimum inhibitory concentration testing of the corneal isolates to the fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and to the aminoglycosides (tobramycin and gentamicin) was performed using the vitek (automatic microbial system biomerieux vitek, inc., hazelwood, missouri) method. results: during this 9-year period, 2920 consecutive corneal cultures were obtained, and a pathogen was recovered in 1468 cultures (50%). the number of corneal ulcers scraped, positive cultures, recovered bacterial isolates, and ratio of gram-positive to gram-negative isolates per year remained approximately equal throughout the study period. staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa represented 19.4% and 25.7%, respectively, of the total bacterial isolates during this period. however, we documented a gradual increase in the number of s. aureus keratitis isolates (29% of gram-positive organisms in 1990 versus 48% in 1998, p = 0.01) coupled with a decrease in the number of p. aeruginosa isolates (54% of gram-negative organisms in 1990 versus 46% in 1998). a decrease in the incidence of contact lens-associated keratitis and p. aeruginosa isolates in this group of patients was documented. serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa were most commonly isolated in contact lens-associated keratitis (18% each). there was increasing laboratory resistance of s. aureus keratitis isolates to the fluoroquinolones (11% in 1990 to 28% in 1998), but resistance patterns to the aminoglycosides remained unchanged. there was a three-fold increase in the percentage of resistant s. aureus isolates to fluoroquinolones between 1990 and 1994 and between 1995 and 1998. both fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides exhibited low in vitro effectiveness against p. aeruginosa throughout the study period. conclusions: the increased recovery of s. aureus keratitis isolates and decreased laboratory effectiveness against fluoroquinolones to these pathogens present an important therapeutic challenge.
[antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis. ii antibiotic strategy].
antibiotherapy is one of the main treatments of cystic fibrosis, contributing to  a better nutritional and respiratory status and a prolonged survival. the choice of antibiotics depends on quantitative and qualitative analysis of sputum, bacteria resistance phenotypes and severity of infection. haemophilus influenzae infection can be treated orally with the association of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or a cephalosporin. staphylococcus aureus generally remains sensitive to usual antibiotics; in case of a methicillin-resistant strain, an oral bitherapy or a parenteral cure can be proposed. treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa is different in case of first colonization or chronic infection: in first colonization, parenteral antibiotherapy (beta-lactams-aminoglycosids) followed by inhaled antibiotherapy may eradicate the bacteria; in chronic infections, exacerbations require parenteral bi-antibiotherapy (beta-lactams or quinolons and aminoglycosids) for 15 to 21 days, inhaled antibiotics between the cures being useful to decrease the number of exacerbation. a careful monitoring of antibiotherapy is necessary because of possible induction of bacterial resistance, nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminosids and allergy to beta-lactams.
[the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
[the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b. longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.
[the reciprocal effect of the causative agents in a mixed infection in burn injury].
in vitro experiments on the joint cultivation of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococci and in vivo experiments carried out on mice with the experimental mixed infection of a burn injury revealed the pronounced antagonistic action of p. aeruginosa with respect to staphylococci and e. coli. under the same conditions, in the joint cultivation of p. aeruginosa and fungi of the genus candida and in the mixed infection of a burn wound caused by the same microorganisms the mutual stimulation of multiplication and a considerable aggravation of the clinical course of a burn wound were observed. the mutual influence of associates in the mixed infection of a burn injury is manifested by an increase in the number of an antibiotic-resistance microorganisms in their populations and, so far as the macroorganism is concerned, in the aggravation of the course of the infectious process and the formation of the pronounced state of immunodeficiency.
bioactive 12-oleanene triterpene and secotriterpene acids from maytenus undata.
the aerial parts of maytenus undata yielded four new 12-oleanene and 3,4-seco-12-oleanene triterpene acids, namely, 3-oxo-11alpha-methoxyolean-12-ene-30-oic acid (1), 3-oxo-11alpha-hydroxyolean-12-ene-30-oic acid (2), 3-oxo-olean-9(11), 12-diene-30-oic acid (3), and 3,4-seco-olean-4(23),12-diene-3, 29-dioic acid (20-epi-koetjapic acid) (5), together with the known 3, 11-dioxoolean-12-ene-30-oic acid (3-oxo-18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid) (4), koetjapic acid (6), and the 12-oleanene artifact 3-oxo-11alpha-ethoxyolean-12-ene-30-oic acid (7). koetjapic acid (6) inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an mic range of 3.125-6.25 microg/ml. the new 3,4-secotriterpene acid 20-epi-koetjapic acid (5) potently inhibited rat neonatal brain microglia phorbol ester-stimulated thromboxane b(2) (ic(50) = 0.5 microm) and superoxide anion (ic(50) = 1.9 microm) generation.
screening of some palestinian medicinal plants for antibacterial activity.
antibacterial activity of organic and aqueous extracts of 15 palestinian medicinal plants were carried against eight different species of bacteria: bacillus subtilis, two escherichia coli species, staphylococcus aureus (methicillin resistant), two s. aureus (methicillin sensitive) species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus fecalis. of the 15 plants tested, eight showed antibacterial activity. each plant species has unique against different bacteria. the most active antibacterial plants against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were thymus vulgaris and thymus origanium. the organic and aqueous extract from the same plants showed different activities; the organic extract showed the same or greater activity than the aqueous extract. finally, the hole-plate diffusion method showed larger activity than the disc diffusion method.
[evaluation of the activity and effects of combinations of various antibacterial  agents against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in vitro].
mics of various antibacterial agents against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were measured. furthermore, we evaluated the effects of combinations of antibacterial agents against mrsa in vitro. in 24 cases out of 37, in which mrsa was isolated from inpatients, other microorganisms, such as candida spp., entrococcus spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were simultaneously isolated. from the results of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), obtained from micro broth-dilution method, of various antibacterial agents against mrsa, range of mics of arbekacin (abk), vancomycin (vcm) and teicoplanin (teic) were < or = 0.25-4.0, 0.5-1.0 and 0.25-4.0 micrograms/ml respectively, and no strains of mrsa showed resistance to abk, vcm and teic, so that we concluded that these three antibacterial agents were effective for mrsa infection. on the in vitro study of combination-effect of antibacterial agents, significant synergistic effects were achieved in the combination of vcm and flomoxef (fmox) (synergism rate was 97.3%) or vcm and imipenem (ipm) (synergism rate was 97.2%). from the results that the fractional inhibitory concentration index in the combination of vcm with ipm was smaller than that with fmox and that p. aeruginosa or enterococcus spp. were simultaneously isolated in high frequency in the mrsa-isolated cases, we thought that the combination of vcm with ipm is more useful, because ipm is effective against p. aeruginosa but fmox is not.
antibacterial activity of anesthetic solutions and preservatives: an in vitro comparative study.
purpose: to investigate the antibacterial activity of topical anesthetic solutions and their preservatives individually in vitro, to determine involvement with bacterial growth inhibition. material and methods: proparacaine and tetracaine (in concentrations of 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.50%), edetate disodium (edta), benzalkonium chloride, edta + benzalkonium chloride, and sterile saline solution were used. five microliters of each solution were applied to standard filter paper disks and placed in mueller-hinton agar previously inoculated with known strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. zones of growth inhibition were measured 24 hours later and analyzed. results: there were no zones of inhibition in the agar inoculated with p. aeruginosa to all tested solutions. benzalkonium chloride alone and associated with edta inhibited growth of s. aureus. all other solutions did not inhibit s. aureus. conclusion: preservative-free anesthetic solutions seemed not to interfere with bacterial development in culture media. benzalkonium chloride alone and associated with edta inhibited development of gram positive bacteria, s. aureus, but did not inhibit p. aeruginosa.
in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.
frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for pathogens isolated from latin american patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998).
the correct empiric choice of antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of pneumonia in hospitalized patients has established itself as a major therapeutic challenge to clinicians. selection of an inappropriate antimicrobial agent could lead to increased rates of mortality and morbidity. characteristics of pathogens responsible for this infection such as species prevalence, overall antimicrobial resistance rates, and mechanisms of detected resistance could serve as an invaluable resource to clinicians in making such therapeutic selections. this report addresses the aforementioned problems/needs by analysis of 712 strains isolated from the lower respiratory tract of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of pneumonia in 10 latin american medical centers in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998). the four most frequently isolated pathogens (no/% of total) were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (191/26.8%), staphylococcus aureus (171/24.0%), klebsiella spp. (86/12.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (75/10.5%); representing nearly 75.0% of all isolates. more than 40 antimicrobial agents (23 reported) were tested against these isolates by reference broth microdilution methodology, and susceptibility profiles were established. the nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria (p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp.) exhibited high levels of resistance to the agents tested. amikacin (77.5% susceptible) was the most active drug tested against p. aeruginosa 50.0% against the acinetobacter spp. isolates. based on published interpretive criteria, over 22.0% of the klebsiella spp. and 12.5% of the escherichia coli were classified as extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers. of the cephalosporin class compounds tested against the klebsiella spp. and e. coli isolates, cefepime demonstrated the highest rates of susceptibility (84.9% and 91.7%, respectively). this compound also fared well against the enterobacter spp. isolates, inhibiting 88.2% of the isolates tested, many of which were resistant to ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. resistance to oxacillin among the s. aureus isolates was nearly 50. 0%, with vancomycin, teicoplanin, and the streptogramin combination quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibiting all isolates. several clusters of multiply resistant organisms were also observed, and further characterization by ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis established possible patient-to-patient spread. the results of this study indicate that rates of resistance among respiratory tract pathogens continue to rise in latin america, with specific concerns for the high prevalence of nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria isolated, oxacillin resistance rates in s. aureus, and the epidemic dissemination of multiply-resistant strains in several medical centers. international surveillance programs (sentry) should assist in the control of escalating antimicrobial resistance in this geographic area.
antimicrobial activity and spectrum of the new glycylcycline, gar-936 tested against 1,203 recent clinical bacterial isolates.
the in vitro activity of gar-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and several other antimicrobial agents. a total of 1,203 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth or agar dilution methods. among the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, gar-936 was generally two- to four-fold more active than minocycline, and two- to 16-fold more active than tetracycline. all enteric bacilli mic90 results were < or = 4 microg/ml; the exception being proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (> or = 8 microg/ml). gar-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with 90% of the penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates inhibited at 0.03 microg/ml, while the same isolates had a mic90 of 8 and > 8 microg/ml for minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. all enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 0.25 microg/ml of gar-936 (mic90, 0.12 or 0.25 microg/ml). although gar-936 (mic50, 0.25 microg/ml) was two-fold less active than minocycline (mic50, 0.12 microg/ml) against oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, all isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. gar-936 demonstrated good activity against nonfermentative bacteria such as acinetobacter spp. (mic90, 2 microg/ml) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 microg/ml), but the compound exhibited only modest activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 8 microg/ml). haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 1-2 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.12 microg/ml), and various neisseria spp. (mic90, 0.12-0.5 microg/ml) were susceptible to gar-936. these results indicate that gar-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, and that several gram-positive and -negative isolates resistant to older tetracyclines and other drug classes remain susceptible to gar-936, the newest glycylcycline candidate for clinical use.
[in vitro activities of carbapenem antibiotics against the various clinical isolates].
the annual changes of antibacterial activities of beta-lactam antibiotics, mainly carbapenem antibiotics, were investigated against 5 bacterial species, s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had been isolated from the clinical materials at toho university omori hospital during the period of 1995 to 1997. in addition, antibacterial activities against other main bacterial strains isolated from the clinical materials during 1997 were also determined. the five bacterial species on which annual changes of the sensitivity were investigated did not show any remarkable trend to increase in resistance to the carbapenem antibiotics tested. the antibacterial activities of the carbapenem antibiotics against mrsa were weak, and mic90 values were between 25 and 50 micrograms/ml. in s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa on which high resistance by the production of metallo-beta-lactamase has become a problem in recent years, there were no remarkable changes in annual changes of sensitivities. especially, mic90 valuses of the carbapenem antibiotics against p. aeruginosa were between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, 4 to 8 times better than that of pipc, like the case of caz. furthermore, the carbapenem antibiotics showed strong antibacterial activities against clinically important 16 bacterial species, from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria.
in vitro activities of novel trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the in vitro activities of the novel 1beta-methylcarbapenems j-111, 225, j-114,870, and j-114,871, which have a structurally unique side chain that consists of a trans-3,5-disubstituted 5-arylpyrrolidin-3-ylthio moiety at the c-2 position, were compared with those of reference antibiotics. among isolates of both methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcons), 90% were inhibited by j-111,347 (prototype), j-111,225, j-114,870, and j-114,871 at concentrations of 2, 4, 4, and 4 microgram/ml (mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic(90)s]), respectively, indicating that these agents were 32- to 64-fold more potent than imipenem, which has an mic(90) of 128 microgram/ml. although these drugs were less active in vitro than vancomycin, which had mic(90)s of 1 and 2 microgram/ml for mrsa and mrcons, respectively, the new carbapenems displayed better killing kinetics than vancomycin. the potent anti-mrsa activity was ascribed to the excellent affinities of the new carbapenems for penicillin-binding protein 2a of mrsa. since the new carbapenems also exhibited good activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria including clinically important pathogens such as penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and clostridium difficile, as well as mrsa, the novel carbapenems are worthy of further evaluation.
[in vitro antibacterial activities of carbapenems against clinical isolates].
antibacterial activities of four carbapenems, imipenem, panipenem, meropenem, and biapenem, were determined using 353 strains belonging to 18 bacterial species which were isolated from clinical materials at ehime university hospital. the mic values of these carbapenems against mrsa were widely distributed between 0.1 and 100 micrograms/ml, and mic90 values of these 4 carbapenems were 25-50 micrograms/ml. any of these carbapenems prevented the bacterial growth of enterobacteriaceae of 8 bacterial species excluding s. macrescens at concentrations of 1 microgram/ml or less. the mic values against p. aeruginosa showed relatively wide distribution, being 0.39-25 micrograms/ml for imipenem, 0.2-25 micrograms/ml for panipenem, 0.1-12.5 micrograms/ml for meropenem, and 0.2-12.5 micrograms/ml for biapenem. from those results, it was confirmed that any of the carbapenems tested had a wide antibacterial spectrum and strong antibacterial activities.
disk diffusion susceptibility test development for the new glycylcycline, gar-936.
the in vitro activity of gar-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and the disk diffusion susceptibility test was assessed. nearly 700 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution and disk diffusion (two disk contents) methods. among the enterobacteriaceae, gar-936 was generally two- to 16-fold more active than other tetracyclines. all enteric bacilli mic90 results were < or = 4 micrograms/ml; the exception being proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (> or = 8 micrograms/ml). gar-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with enterococcus spp. (including vancomycin-resistant isolates) inhibited at 0.25 microgram/ml (gar-936 mic90, 0.12 or 0.25 microgram/ml) and the oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml. gar-936 demonstrated good potency against several non-fermentative bacteria, but possessed limited activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 8 micrograms/ml). in vitro susceptibility test methods were developed (disk diffusion versus reference mic results) and tentative breakpoints were proposed. using susceptibility criteria of either < or = 2 or < or = 4 micrograms/ml, gar-936 in vitro susceptibility tests demonstrated rare significant serious inter-method discords (< or = 1.2%) and an absolute agreement between test results of 92.3 to 96.2%. these results indicate that gar-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important rapidly growing pathogenic bacteria, and that this novel glycylcycline candidate for clinical use should be further developed.
the in-vitro activity and tentative breakpoint of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone.
the in-vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against a wide range (c. 700) of recent clinical isolates, was compared with that of three other fluoroquinolones and other relevant agents. gemifloxacin inhibited 90% of the enterobacteriaceae strains at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being serratia spp. (mic(90) 1 mg/l) and strains possessing a putative mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones. ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 4 mg/l. gemifloxacin had good activity against respiratory pathogens, with 90% of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis being inhibited by 0.06 mg/l or less. staphylococcus aureus (mssa) were highly susceptible (mic(90) 0.06 mg/l) but mrsa less susceptible (mic(90) 8 mg/l) to gemifloxacin. enterococcus spp. were markedly more susceptible to the study agent than to ciprofloxacin. gemifloxacin showed good activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and anaerobic cocci. a tentative in-vitro breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l was studied using a 1 microg disc content for all genera except pseudomonas where a 5 microg disc content was employed. the false sensitivity reporting rate was 0.5% and false resistance rate was 6.0%, which was considered acceptable. in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a highly active fluoroquinolone that should prove clinically useful in the treatment of a wide range of infections. susceptibility testing criteria have been developed that should prove robust in a clinical laboratory.
identification of an anti-mycobacterial domain in nk-lysin and granulysin.
nk-lysin and granulysin are homologous cationic anti-bacterial peptides produced  by pig and human cytolytic lymphocytes, respectively. the solution structure of nk-lysin comprises five amphipathic alpha-helices. to investigate the properties of a helix-loop-helix region postulated to be a membrane-docking part of nk-lysin, we synthesized 22- and 29-residue peptides reproducing this region for both nk-lysin and granulysin. cd spectroscopy of the synthetic peptides in a liposomal solution showed spectra typical of alpha-helical peptides. the peptides were active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with the two nk-lysin peptides showing higher anti-bacterial activities than the two from granulysin. one nk-lysin peptide was active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, two organisms against which nk-lysin is inactive. granulysin peptides were inactive against these bacteria, in contrast with granulysin, which is known to be active against them. both nk-lysin and all synthetic analogues killed mycobacterium tuberculosis and k562 tumour cells, but did not display haemolytic activity. these results identify a potent anti-mycobacterial domain in nk-lysin and granulysin consisting of a 22-residue (helix 3) sequence plus a disulphide-constrained loop.
united states geographic bacteria susceptibility patterns. 1997 ascp susceptibility testing group.
antimicrobial drug resistance in bacterial pathogens continues, with 1997 seeing  reports of staphylococcus aureus no longer fully susceptible to vancomycin occurring in the united states. to better deal with this rapidly developing problem, we present the third year of united states national data that highlights the geographic nature of increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. in 1997, we observed increasing numbers of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, more methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and an apparent spreading of penicillin resistance in pneumococci. the majority of reporting sites now indicates that over 20% of pseudomonas aeruginosa are fully resistant to ciprofloxacin, the only oral agent available for treating this pathogen. with increasing resistance coming at a time of decreasing available resources, it is more clear than ever before that the future of infectious diseases and clinical microbiology remains filled with challenge.
in-vitro activity of cefepime and other broad-spectrum antimicrobials against several groups of gram-negative bacilli and staphylococcus aureus.
the in vitro activity of cefepime was compared with that of amikacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam by using the e-test against five groups of carefully selected organisms: klebsiella pneumoniae (68 isololates), pseudomonas aeruginosa (62), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (60), and two groups of enterobacteriaceae (60 and 62 isolates, respectively). the bacteria were subdivided according to whether the infection was nosocomial or community-acquired, applying accepted and predefined criteria. these isolates were obtained from patients admitted to our medical center throughout 1998. we retrospectively compared antimicrobial susceptibilities of the study sample with those of the +/- 3000 bacterial strains isolated from blood stream infections since 1990: the study sample appeared to represent adequately the clinical databank. presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) was determined in all groups of enterobacteriaceae with the esbl screening e-test strip. of the 252 gram-negative bacilli tested, 242 (96%) were susceptible to cefepime, whereas only 168 (67%) were susceptible to ceftazidime, 211 (84%) to amikacin, and 220 (87%) to piperacillin-tazobactam (p < 0.001). imipenem was slightly superior to cefepime with only seven isolates resistant (3%), six of which were p. aeruginosa. cefepime was more active against enterobacteriaceae than ceftazidime (93% vs. 72%, p < 0.001). this superiority was most evident against nosocomial strains of k. pneumoniae, against which cefepime was > three times more active than ceftazidime. the high level of resistance seen in nosocomial isolates of k. pneumoniae is consistent with high rates of esbl production (69%, compared with 15-26% in other enterobacteriaceae). the mic90 of cefepime to methicillin-sensitive s. aureus was 1.5 micrograms/ml, whereas that of ceftazidime was 4 micrograms/ml; the susceptibility rate of both was 100%. in conclusion, cefepime possesses in vitro potencies against mssa and current clinical strains of gram-negative bacilli, many of which harbor resistance to other antimicrobial agents. hence, it seems very suitable for empiric coverage of serious nosocomial infections.
antimicrobial activities of several parts of pinus brutia, juniperus oxycedrus, abies cilicia, cedrus libani and pinus nigra.
in this study, the antimicrobial activities of several parts of various trees grown in the kahramanmaras region of turkey were investigated by the disc diffusion method. chloroform, acetone and methanol extracts of leaves, resins, barks, cones and fruits of pinus brutia ten., juniperus oxycedrus l., abies cilicia ant. & kotschy carr., cedrus libani a. rich. and pinus nigra arn. were prepared and tested against bacillus megaterium dsm 32, bacillus subtilis img 22, bacillus cereus fmc 19, escherichia coli dm, klebsiella pneumoniae fmc 3, enterobacter aerogenes ccm 2531, staphylococcus aureus cowan 1, mycobacterium smegmatis rut, proteus vulgaris fmc 1, listeria monocytogenes scoot a, pseudomonas aeruginosa dsm 5007, candida albicans ccm 314, candida tropicalis mdc 86 and penicillium italicum k. the results showed that antifungal effects were not observed for the whole extracts, e. coli was not inhibited by any of the plant extracts except by the chloroform and acetone extracts of the leaves of a. cilicia, which showed inhibition zones of 16-18 mm, respectively. all the plant extracts used in this study inhibited the development of the other bacteria studied. when the results of this study were compared with an ampicillin standard, it was found that the microorganisms studied were generally susceptible, intermediate or resistant to the extracts of species when compared with the ampicillin standard. on the other hand, the acetone and methanol extracts of juniperus fruits were found to be quite resistant.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1997)].
the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 17 institutions around the entire japan, 512 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 440 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1997 to september in 1998. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 100 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 81 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 85 strains of haemophilus influenzae. 71 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 27 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 33 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 17 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 55.0%. the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 67.3%. arbekacin (abk) and vancomycin (vcm) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml against s. pneumoniae. the frequency of penicillin (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp)+pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) had decreased gradually, that is, in 1995 the frequency of it was 40.3%, but that was 30.9% in 1997. against h. influenzae and m.(b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities. but the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) had decreased in 1997, compared those in 1995 and 1996. meropenem (mepm), ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). and tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were more active against k. pneumoniae in 1997 than that in 1996. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 45.5% of all the patients showing a slight increase year by year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases, not so particular changes were recognized as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 33.6% and 29.1%, respectively. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these had reversed in bacterial pneumonia. the tendency in bacterial pneumonia had been acknowledged since 1995. the increase of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid strains) isolated after administration of antibiotics, has suggested the decrease of the susceptibility of these strains against antibiotics. administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 24.5%, h. influenzae 21.4%, s. aureus 18.4% and p. aeruginosa 12.2%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 47.8% after administration over 15 days. from patients administered antibiotics of penicillins and cephems. s. aureus was mainly detected with 31.7-58.3%, and from patients administere
phenolic constituents of cassia seeds and antibacterial effect of some naphthalenes and anthraquinones on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
thirteen phenolic glycosides including six new compounds were isolated from seeds of cassia tora (leguminosae). the structures of the new compounds, rubrofusarin triglucoside (7), nor-rubrofusarin gentiobioside (9), demethylflavasperone gentiobioside (10), torachrysone gentiobioside (11), torachrysone tetraglucoside (12) and torachrysone apioglucoside (13), were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and chemical evidence. the effects of the phenolic glycosides, their aglycones and several other compounds structurally related to them on escherichia coli k12, pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and some strains of staphylococcus aureus were then examined. among them, torachrysone (15), toralactone (16), aloe-emodin (18), rhein (19) and emodin (20) showed noticeable antibacterial effects on four strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2-64 micrograms/ml. on the other hand, the phenolic compounds tested did not show strong antibacterial effects on e. coli and p. aeruginosa.
frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens associated with skin and soft tissue infections during 1997 from an international surveillance programme. sentry participants group.
the sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme was established to provide a coordinated, standardised, international surveillance on antimicrobial resistance. in one part of the programme, isolates from skin and soft tissue infections sent from 20 hospitals in 12 different european countries were investigated in the european coordinating centre. of 1013 isolates, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most significant species, constituting almost 50% of the referred isolates. methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus averaged 22% across europe, only slightly less than that in isolates derived from blood. less than 5% of the enterococcal isolates were resistant to vancomycin. piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active penicillin-derived beta-lactam compound against pseudomonas aeruginosa, inhibiting 91.3% of the isolates, while ceftazidime and cefepime were the most active cephalosporins, inhibiting 85.8% and 80.3% of the isolates, respectively. putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was not detected in escherichia coli and was found in only 5.1% of the klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. in general, strains of the family enterobacteriaceae remained mostly susceptible to carbapenems, cefepime, and amikacin.
an unusual structural motif of antimicrobial peptides containing end-to-end macrocycle and cystine-knot disulfides.
four macrocyclic cystine-knot peptides of 29-31 residues, kalata, circulin a and  b (cira and cirb), and cyclopsychotride, have been isolated from coffee plants but have undetermined physiological functions. these macrocycles and 10 of their analogs prepared by chemical synthesis were tested against nine strains of microbes. kalata and cira were specific for the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus with a minimum inhibition concentration of approximately 0.2 microm. they were relatively ineffective against gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, cirb and cyclopsychotride were active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in particular, cirb showed potent activity against e. coli with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.41 microm. all four cyclic peptides were moderately active against two strains of fungi, candida kefyr and candida tropicalis, but were inactive against candida albicans. these macrocycles are cytotoxic and lysed human red blood cell with a lethal dose 50% of 400 microm. modifying the arg residue in kalata with a keto aldehyde significantly reduced its activity against s. aureus whereas blocking the arg in cira produced no significant effect. the two-disulfide variants and their scrambled disulfide isomers exhibited antimicrobial profiles and potency similar to their native peptides. however, in high-salt assays (100 mm nacl), few of these macrocyclic peptides, natives or analogs, retained antimicrobial activity. these results show that the macrocyclic peptides possess specific and potent antimicrobial activity that is salt-dependent and that their initial interactions with the microbial surfaces may be electrostatic, an effect commonly found in defensin antimicrobial peptides. furthermore, their end-to-end cyclic structure with a cystine-knot motif represents a molecular structure of antimicrobials and may provide a useful template for the design of novel peptide antibiotics.
purification and properties of proline-rich antimicrobial peptides from sheep and goat leukocytes.
we purified three proline-rich antimicrobial peptides from elastase-treated extracts of sheep and goat leukocytes and subjected two of them, oabac5alpha and chbac5, to detailed analysis. oabac5alpha and chbac5 were homologous to each other and to bovine bac5. both exhibited potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity under low-concentration salt conditions. while the peptides remained active against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, and listeria monocytogenes in 100 mm nacl, they lost activity against staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans under these conditions. chbac5 was shown to bind lipopolysaccharide, a property that could enhance its ability to kill gram-negative bacteria. proline-rich bac5 peptides are highly conserved in ruminants and may contribute significantly to their innate host defense mechanisms.
comparison of castile soap, benzalkonium chloride, and bacitracin as irrigation solutions for complex contaminated orthopaedic wounds.
objective: the purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of cleaning a contaminated orthopaedic wound with different classes of wound irrigation solutions. study design: rats with a contaminated orthopaedic wound were randomized into treatment groups: normal saline (ns), castile soap (cs), benzalkonium chloride (bzc), bacitracin (abx), or sequential irrigation with bzc, cs, and ns. intervention: pseudomonas aeruginosa [p. aeruginosa; 1 x 10(6) colony-forming units (cfu)], or staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus; 1 x 10(6) cfu) were placed into a paravertebral wound (containing a wire implant placed through a spinous process) and allowed to incubate for fifteen minutes. the wound was then irrigated with three liters of either ns, 0.05 percent cs, 0.03 percent bzc, abx (33,000 units per liter) or underwent a sequential irrigation treatment (one liter each of bzc, cs, ns). main outcome measurements: the animals were observed daily for wound complications for fourteen days and then killed, and cultures of the wound were obtained. results: pseudomonas aeruginosa: both cs and the sequential irrigation treatment significantly lowered the rate of positive wound cultures when compared with ns (p < 0.05). irrigation with bzc resulted in a higher rate of positive wound cultures and complications. the sequential irrigation treatment prevented the wound complications associated with irrigation with bzc alone. staphylococcus aureus: only bzc irrigation significantly lowered the rate of positive wound cultures when compared with ns (p < 0.05). conclusion: the rate of positive wound cultures due to p. aeruginosa is effectively reduced by irrigation with cs alone or by the sequential irrigation treatment. when used alone, the antiseptic bzc results in a higher rate of positive wound cultures and wound complications. the wound complications seen with irrigation with bzc alone are prevented by the sequential irrigation treatment (bzc followed by cs and ns). the rate of positive wound cultures in this model due to s. aureus is not decreased by irrigation with cs; however, the rate of positive wound cultures is safely and effectively decreased with the use of bzc.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). iii secular changes in susceptibility].
susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, echerichia coli, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 hospitals during june 1997 to may 1998, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. e. faecalis the mic90s of quinolones for e. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated utis have changed better state during the latest period. among e. faecalis strains, those with high susceptibilities to ampicillin (abpc) and minocycline (mino) appeared to had decreased during period of 1995-1997, which recovered during the latest period. 2. s. aureus the sensitive strains of s. aureus to imipenem (ipm) and clindamycin (cldm) had increased during the period of 1996-1997, but those have decreased again during the latest period. 3. e. coli the susceptibilities of e. coli to mino have been better in the latest period with the mic90 was ranged from 2 to 4 micrograms/ml. the susceptibilities to quinolones of e. coli isolated from complicated utis had decreased during the period of 1995-1997, but those have recovered during the latest period. 4. klebsiella spp. among klebsiella spp. strains isolated from uncomplicated utis, those with low susceptibilities to almost cephems have increased in the latest period. to other antimicrobial agents, the susceptibilities of klebsiella spp. did not show any changes during the latest period. 5. p. aeruginosa the susceptibilities to most agents of p. aeruginosa did not show any changes, the decreased susceptibilities to cefozopran (czop), carbapenems and monobactams of p. aeruginosa observed in 1996 appeared to have been retrieved in 1997. these susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
effects of a perfluorochemical emulsion on the fate of circulating pseudomonas aeruginosa.
because mononuclear phagocytes take up perfluorochemical emulsions (pfce), we examined how prior treatment with pfce affects the fate of circulating bacteria. rats were preinjected with three daily intravenous injections of pfce (2.0 ml/100 g) containing 12.5% (vol/vol) of a 4:1 mixture of f-dimethyl adamantane and f-trimethylbicyclo-nonane, 2.5% (wt/vol) pluronic f-68 as the emulsifying agent, and 3% (wt/vol) hydroxyethyl starch as the oncotic agent. pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus were injected 4 h after the third pfce injection. pfce pretreatment decreased the rate and extent of vascular clearance of p. aeruginosa, with decreased uptake by the liver. importantly, there were significant decreases in killing of p. aeruginosa in the liver, lungs, spleen, and kidneys of pfce animals. pfce did not alter the clearance of s. aureus from the circulation. however, hepatic uptake was reduced, with concomitant increases in lung and kidney uptake. ultrastructure of kupffer cells revealed pfce inclusions and extensive vacuolization. these experiments demonstrate that the clearance kinetics and organ distribution of circulating p. aeruginosa and their subsequent killing are altered by pfce. diminished hepatic phagocyte function leads to a decrease in vascular clearance of circulating bacteria, increased uptake in other reticuloendothelial organs, and decreased bactericidal activity versus p. aeruginosa.
polyelectroylte complex composed of chitosan and sodium alginate for wound dressing application.
drug-impregnated polyelectrolyte complex (pec) sponge composed of chitosan and sodium alginate was prepared for wound dressing application. the morphological structure of this wound dressing was observed to be composed of a dense skin outer layer and a porous cross-section layer by scanning electron microscopy (sem). equilibrium water content and release of silver sulfadiazine (agsd) could be controlled by the number of repeated in situ pec reactions between chitosan and sodium alginate. the release of agsd from agsd-impregnated pec wound dressing in pbs buffer (ph = 7.4) was dependent on the number of repeated in situ complex formations for the wound dressing. the antibacterial capacity of agsd-impregnated wound dressing was examined in agar plate against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. from the behavior of antimicrobial release and the suppression of bacterial proliferation, it is thought that the pec wound dressing containing antimicrobial agents could protect the wound surfaces from bacterial invasion and effectively suppress bacterial proliferation. in the cytotoxicity test, cellular damage was reduced by the controlled released of agsd from the sponge matrix of agsd-medicated wound dressing. in vivo tests showed that granulation tissue formation and wound contraction for the agsd plus dihydroepiandrosterone (dhea) impregnated pec wound dressing were faster than any other groups.
evaluation of the in vitro activity of six broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents tested against over 2,000 clinical isolates from 22 medical centers in japan. japan antimicrobial resistance study group.
numerous broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents have been introduced into medical practice since 1985. although several of these compounds have advanced, infectious disease therapy resistances to them has also emerged world-wide. in 1997, a japanese 22 medical center investigation was initiated to assess the continued utility of these agents (oxacillin or piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, cefoperazone/sulbactam [c/s], imipenem). the participating medical centers represented a wide geographic distribution, and a common protocol and reagents were applied. three control strains and a set of challenge organisms were provided to participant centers. etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) strips were used in concurrent tests of these organisms and a qualitative determination of participant skills in the identification of resistant and susceptible phenotypes was established. the quantitative controls demonstrated 97.7-99.2% of mic values within established qc limits, and the qualitative (susceptibility category) controls documented a 97.3% agreement of participant results with that of reference values (1,320 total results). only 0.2% of values were false-susceptible errors. after the participant quality was assured, a total of 2,015 clinical strains were tested (10 strains from 10 different organism groups including methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci [cons], escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., indole-positive proteae, serratia spp., acinetobacter spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the staphylococci were uniformly susceptible to all drugs tested except ceftazidime (mic90, 24 micrograms/ml) that had a potency six- to 12-fold less than either cefepime or cefpirome. only 3.7 and 45.1% of s. aureus and cons were susceptible to ceftazidime, respectively. among e. coli and klebsiella spp. the rank order of antimicrobial spectrum was imipenem = "fourth-generation" cephalosporins > ceftazidime > c/s > piperacillin. possible extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes were identified in 2.9-8.6% of these isolates. isolates of c. freundii, enterobacter spp., proteae, and serratia spp. that were resistant to ceftazidime and piperacillin remained susceptible to imipenem (0.0-4.5% resistance) and cefepime (0.0-5.0%). acinetobacters were inhibited best by c/s (99.5% susceptible) and least susceptible to piperacillin (mic90, > 256 micrograms/ml; 21.7% susceptible) activity. p. aeruginosa isolates were most susceptible to cefepime (83.6%) and this zwitterionic cephalosporin also had the lowest level of resistance (9.1% of mics at > or = 32 micrograms/ml). several multi-resistant organisms were identified in participant medical centers including s. marcescens strains resistant to cefepime, imipenem, or both observed in six hospitals. clonal spread was documented in two medical centers; one hospital having two distinct epidemic clusters. also a multi-resistant e. cloacae was found in two patients in the same hospital. evaluations of carbapenem resistance in four species discovered only two strains (in same hospital) among 40 p. aeruginosa isolates (5.0%) with a metallo-enzyme, with nearly all of the remaining strains inhibited by an ambler class c enzyme inhibitor (brl42715) indicating a hyperproduction of a chromosomal cephalosporinase. these results indicate that most newer beta-lactams remain widely useable in medical centers in japan, but emerging often clonal, resistances have occurred. the overall rank order of antimicrobial spectrum against all ten tested bacterial groups favors the "fourth-generation" cephalosporin, cefepime (96.4% susceptible) as an equal to imipenem (95.9%) > c/s (90.9%) = cefpirome (90.0%) > ceftazidime (75.1%) = penicillins, either oxacillin or piperacillin (76.4%).
prediction of the antimicrobial effects of trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin on staphylococci using an in-vitro dynamic model.
to compare the pharmacodynamics of trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin, three clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus with different mics (0.03, 0.15, 0.6 and 0.1, 0.25, 1.25 mg/l, respectively) were exposed to decreasing concentrations of the quinolones according to their half-lives of 9.25 and 4 h, respectively. with each organism, single doses of trovafloxacin and twice-daily doses of ciprofloxacin were designed to provide 8-fold ranges of the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve (auc) to the mic, 58-466 and 116-932 (mg x h/l)/(mg/l), respectively. the antimicrobial effect was expressed by its intensity: the area between the control growth in the absence of antibiotics and the antibiotic-induced time-kill/regrowth curves (i(e)). linear relationships established between i(e) and log auc/mic were bacterial strain-independent but specific for the quinolones (r2 = 0.99 in both cases). at a given auc/mic ratio, the i(e)s of trovafloxacin were greater than those of ciprofloxacin, suggesting that the antimicrobial effect of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin against staphylococci may be even greater than might be expected from the difference in their mics. these data were combined with previous results obtained with three gram-negative bacteria. again, i(e) correlated well with the log auc/mic of trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin in a strain- and species-independent fashion (r2 = 0.94 and 0.96, respectively). on this basis, a value of the auc/mic of trovafloxacin which might be equivalent to schentag's auc/mic = 125 (mg x h/l)/(mg/l) reported as the breakpoint value for ciprofloxacin was estimated at 71 (mg x h/l)/(mg/l) with the respective mic breakpoint of 0.27 mg/l. based on the i(e)-log auc/mic relationships, the i(e)s were plotted against the logarithm of trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin dose (d) for hypothetical representatives of s. aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa with mics corresponding to the mic50s. these i(e)-log d relationships allow prediction of the effect of a given quinolone on a representative strain of the bacterial species.
in vitro activities of designed antimicrobial peptides against multidrug-resistant cystic fibrosis pathogens.
the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens renders antibiotics ineffective in the treatment of lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). designed antimicrobial peptides (daps) are laboratory-synthesized peptide antibiotics that demonstrate a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity. optimal conditions for susceptibility testing of these peptides have not yet been established. medium composition is clearly a major factor influencing the results and reproducibilities of susceptibility tests. using time-kill assays, we tested the effects of different media and buffers on the bactericidal activities of the peptides d2a21 and d4e1 on staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853. each peptide at 1 and 5 microm was incubated with bacteria in the different media and buffers. both peptides were most active in tris-hcl buffer against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. among the more complex media tested, modified rpmi medium was the medium in which the peptides demonstrated the highest activity, while it supported the growth of the bacteria. the broth microdilution technique was used to test the activities of d2a21 and d4e1 in modified rpmi medium against multidrug-resistant pathogens from patients with cf. the mics of daps for methicillin-resistant s. aureus ranged from 0.25 to 4 microg/ml, those for multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa ranged from 0.125 to 4 microg/ml, those for stenotrophomonas maltophilia ranged from 0.5 to 32 microg/ml, and those for burkholderia cepacia ranged from 32 to >/=64 microg/ml. when the activity of peptide d2a21 was compared with that of the tracheal antimicrobial peptide (tap), d2a21 had greater potency than tap against p. aeruginosa. in addition, no difference in the mics of d2a21 was seen when it was tested in nutrient broth supplemented with nacl at different concentrations. thus, daps are a class of salt-insensitive antibiotics potentially useful in the treatment of cf patients harboring multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa.
effects of cytokines and endotoxin on the intracellular growth of bacteria.
patients with unresolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) have persistently elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs and circulation and increased rates of bacterial infections. phagocytic cells hyperactivated with lipopolysaccharide (lps), which induces high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in monocytic cells, are inefficient in killing ingested bacteria despite having intact phagocytic activity. on the other hand, phagocytic cells that are activated with an analogue of lps that does not induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines effectively ingest and kill bacteria. we hypothesized that in the presence of high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, bacteria may adapt and utilize cytokines to their growth advantage. to test our hypothesis, we primed a human monocytic cell line (u937) with escalating concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), and il-6 and with lps. these cells were then exposed to fresh isolates of three common nosocomial pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an acinetobacter sp. in human monocytes primed with lower concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (10 to 250 pg) or lps (1 and 10 ng), intracellular bacterial growth decreased. however, when human monocytes were primed with higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (1 to 10 ng) or lps (1 to 10 micrograms), intracellular growth of the tested bacteria increased significantly (p <0.0001). these results were reproduced with peripheral blood monocytes obtained from normal healthy volunteers. the specificity of the cytokine activity was demonstrated by neutralizing the cytokines with specific antibodies. our findings provide a possible mechanism to explain the frequent development of bacterial infections in patients with an intense and protracted inflammatory response.
influence of organic matter, cations and surfactants on the antimicrobial activity of melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil in vitro.
the effect of some potentially interfering substances and conditions on the antimicrobial activity of melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil was investigated. agar and broth dilution methods were used to determine minimum inhibitory and cidal concentrations of tea tree oil in the presence and absence of each potentially interfering substance. activity was determined against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and candida albicans. minimum inhibitory or cidal concentrations differed from controls by two or more dilutions, for one or more organisms, where tween-20, tween-80, skim-milk powder and bovine serum albumin were assessed. these differences were not seen when assays were performed in anaerobic conditions, or in the presence of calcium and magnesium ions. the effect of organic matter on the antimicrobial activity of tea tree oil was also investigated by an organic soil neutralization test. organisms were exposed to lethal concentrations of tea tree oil ranging from 1-10% (v/v), in the presence of 1-30% (w/v) dry bakers' yeast. after 10 min contact time, viability was determined. at > or = 1%, organic matter compromised the activity of each concentration of tea tree oil against staphylococcus aureus and c. albicans. at 10% or more, organic matter compromised the activity of each tea tree oil concentration against pseudomonas aeruginosa. organic matter affected 1 and 2% tea tree oil, but not 4 and 8%, against escherichia coli. in conclusion, organic matter and surfactants compromise the antimicrobial activity of tea tree oil, although these effects vary between organisms.
[evaluation of a multi-hospital cooperative study on the efficacy and safety of panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) on elderly patients of respiratory infections].
the efficacy and safety of panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) on elderly patients of  respiratory infections was examined at 17 hospitals in a cooperative study. among the 95 case, we examined the efficacy of the medication in 86 cases, and the safety in all 95 cases. efficacy was confirmed in 81.3% of pneumonia patients, 57.7% of secondary-infection patients of chronic respiratory diseases, and 74.4% of the total. no significant difference was observed among each group according to age, comparing patients > or = 65 years old grouped by 5 years, or when broadly comparing groups < 75 years and > or = 75 years of age. the microbiological efficacy was 100% for streptococcus pneumoniae, 80% for staphylococcus aureus, 80% in klebsiella pneumoniae; therefore, a very good disappearance rate of symptoms could be obtained in all major respiratory etiologic agents except pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this study, we also examined other factors considered to affect the course of treatment for elderly patients of infectious diseases, namely the presence of absence of underlying diseases, the distinctness of infectious symptoms, the patient's condition before the appearance of infectious symptoms, and previous history of treatment with antimicrobial agents. for safety, the incidence rate of side effects was 14.7%, which was similar to the 16.9% in the developmental study. these two findings were also similar in content. no significant difference was observed among each age group, comparing patients > or = 65 years old grouped by 5 years, or comparing groups < 75 years and > or = 75 years of age. from the above evaluation, we consider papm/bp to be an effective drug for normal adult patients as well as elderly patients of respiratory infections.
antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for pathogens isolated from patients in latin american medical centers with a diagnosis of pneumonia: analysis of results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997). sentry latin america study group.
pneumonia is the most common fatal hospital-acquired infection, with attributable mortality rates ranging from 30 to 60%. rapid initiation of optimal antimicrobial therapy is essential for obtaining treatment success. in this report the antimicrobial susceptibility of 556 strains from the lower respiratory tract were collected by the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997). these strains were isolated from hospitalized patients with pneumonia in 10 latin american centers (6 countries) as part of this 68-center worldwide program. the isolates were susceptibility tested against more than 70 drugs (35 reported) by the reference broth microdilution method. klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli phenotypically consistent with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production were characterized further by ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the five most frequently isolated species were (n/%): pseudomonas aeruginosa (149/26.8%), staphylococcus aureus (127/22.8%), acinetobacter spp. (66/11.9%), klebsiella spp. (56/10.1%), and enterobacter spp. (40/7.2%). p. aeruginosa demonstrated high rates of resistance to a majority of the antimicrobial drugs tested. carbapenems, amikacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam demonstrated the highest susceptibility rates (73.8-77.2%) against p. aeruginosa, however the lowest resistance rate was observed for cefepime (6.7%). acinetobacter spp. also showed very high rates of resistance and the most active compounds were imipenem and meropenem (89.0% susceptibility) followed by the tetracyclines. cephalosporin susceptibilities among klebsiella spp. were low: cefoxitin, 73.0%; ceftazidime, 69.4%; and ceftriaxone, 65.9%. approximately 37% and 28% of k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates, respectively, were considered esbl producers based on nccls criteria. ceftriaxone was active against only 52.5% of enterobacter spp. isolates, whereas cefepime was active against 90.0% of isolates (mic50, < or = 0.12 microgram/ml). oxacillin resistance was detected in nearly 50% of s. aureus isolates. the most active drugs against s. aureus were vancomycin, teicoplanin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). in summary, our study of pneumonias in latin american medical centers demonstrated a greatly increased prevalence of acinetobacter spp. and higher resistance rates among gram-negative bacilli when compared with similar controlled studies from north america.
synthesis and characterization of bactericidal oligopeptides designed on the basis of an insect anti-bacterial peptide.
defensin from a beetle, allomyrina dichotoma, is known to have anti-bacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. this peptide, which comprises 43 amino acid residues, was effective against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. we identified the active site of beetle defensin by measuring anti-bacterial activity against s. aureus of 64 overlapping 12-mer peptides with either a free carboxylate or a free amide group at their c-termini. an lcaahclaigrr-nh2 (19l-30r-nh2) fragment showed the greatest activity of the synthetic oligopeptides. the 19l-30r-nh2 fragment was effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. cd spectra showed that the 19l-30r-nh2 fragment formed an alpha-helical structure in the lipidic environment. the anti-bacterial effect of the 19l-30r-nh2 fragment was due to its interaction with bacterial membranes, judging from the leakage of liposome-entrapped glucose. its anti-bacterial activity was increased when certain amino acid residues were replaced. truncated peptides having had some amino acids removed from the n-terminus of the 19l-30r-nh2 fragment (8-10-mer peptides) still had strong anti-bacterial activity. deleting some amino acids from the c-terminal region of the fragment dramatically reduced activity, indicating that the c-terminal region of the 19l-30r-nh2 fragment, i.e. rr-nh2, is important for exerting anti-bacterial activity. the ahclaigrr-nh2 (22a-30r-nh2) fragment and its analogues exhibited about 3-fold and 9-12-fold higher activity against s. aureus than did the 19l-30r-nh2 fragment, and these analogues were effective against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from patients. these oligopeptides showed no haemolytic activity and did not inhibit the growth of murine fibroblast cells.
in vitro activity of trovafloxacin (cp 99,219), a new fluoroquinolone against hospital isolates.
the susceptibility of 492 enterobacteriaceae, 227 other gram-negative bacteria, 448 gram-positive bacteria and 108 anaerobic organisms was determined by the agar dilution method against trovafloxacin and other antibiotics. trovafloxacin was highly active against most of the enterobacteriaceae including enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)90 <1 mg/l], acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 = 0.25 and 2 mg/l, respectively). the antimicrobial activity was extended to the gram-positive bacteria including streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus with mic90 <1 mg/l. enterococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were inhibited (mic90 = 2 mg/l; sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were 16 and 64 mg/l, respectively). almost all anaerobic organisms were inhibited by trovafloxacin (mic90 = 1 mg/l).
the preliminary isolation of several antibacterial compounds from combretum erythrophyllum (combretaceae).
freeze dried ground leaves of combretum erythrophyllum were extracted with different extractants to determine if they contain inhibitors of pathogenic bacteria. acetone yielded the most compounds inhibiting the growth of staphylococcus aureus using bioautography of thin layer chromatography plates. acetone also extracted many different compounds and group separation was attempted by solid phase extraction on reverse and normal phase silica gel. both techniques separated the bioactive components to a degree. the best group separation results, however, were obtained using liquid/liquid extraction. the six fractions obtained inhibited the four test organisms to different degrees. s. aureus was the most sensitive (100%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (36%), escherichia coli (11%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%). with s. aureus as test organism, the chloroform soluble fraction contained by far the largest quantity of inhibiting components (100%), followed by the fractions soluble in water (23%), 35% methanol in water (18%), butanol (5%), carbon tetrachloride (2%) and hexane (traces). the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration for s. aureus was 0.05 mg/ml at this stage of purification compared to mic values of 0.08 and 0.16 mg/ml for ampicillin and chloramphenicol. there were at least 14 different inhibitors with a wide range of polarities present in the different fractions. the polar components apparently did not contain polysaccharides and were probably basic according to the chromatographic behaviour.
susceptibility of adherent organisms from pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from burn wounds to antimicrobial agents.
to assess the bactericidal effects of ciprofloxacin, netilymicin, and polymyxin b on adherent pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms and also the bactericidal effects of ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin on adherent staphylococcus aureus cells, a simple end-point microplate assay, based on the method described by miyake et al. was used in the present study. as results of the assay, the minimal inhibitory concentration (micadh) values are taken, which express the susceptibility of the bacterial cells spontaneously released from the surface of adherent microcolonies to antimicrobial agents. also, a minimal bactericidal concentration (mbcadh) value was read, which is defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration required to kill the sessile bacterial cells. for twenty p. aeruginosa strains and nineteen s. aureus strains isolated from burn wounds, an enhanced resistance against bactericidal action of the applied antibiotics was observed when bacterial cells were attached to polystyrene surface. the micadh values were comparable with the conventional mic values only for ciprofloxacin and netilmicin for p. aeruginosa strains. the mbcadh values exceeded many times the conventional mbc values for the majority of strains. the validity of the assay was estimated in the experiment designed to determine the concentration of ciprofloxacin that should be released topically from the collagen dressing to prevent the biomaterial from microbial colonization and allow the decontamination of the wound.
ofloxacin. a reappraisal of its use in the management of genitourinary tract infections.
ofloxacin is an established fluoroquinolone agent which achieves good concentrations in genitourinary tract tissues and fluids. it has good in vitro activity against most enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus saprophyticus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis and haemophilus ducreyi, intermediate activity against ureaplasma urealyticum and most enterococci, but limited or no in vitro activity against enterococci, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and many anaerobes. however, high concentrations achieved in the urine ensure its activity against most urinary tract pathogens. ofloxacin demonstrates consistent efficacy in a broad range of urinary tract infections, achieving bacteriological response rates in excess of 80% in uncomplicated and 70% in complicated infections. the efficacy of ofloxacin was similar to that of all comparators tested including other fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). ofloxacin is also effective as a single-dose regimen in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea, as a 7-day regimen in uncomplicated c. trachomatis infections, and as monotherapy in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). again, ofloxacin demonstrated similar efficacy to alternative treatments in each type of infection. the availability of an intravenous formulation and near-complete oral bioavailability allow ofloxacin to be administered as a sequential regimen without loss of activity. the tolerability and drug interaction profile of ofloxacin is consistent with that of other fluoroquinolones. the most commonly reported adverse events with ofloxacin are gastrointestinal, neurological and dermatological. it was associated with a lower incidence of photosensitivity and tendinitis and higher incidence of some neurological events than some other fluoroquinolones. ofloxacin seems to have a lower propensity to interact with xanthines than other fluoroquinolones. conclusion: ofloxacin has established efficacy in the treatment of a wide variety of urinary tract infections, although, like other fluoroquinolones, it should be used rationally to preserve its activity. currently, ofloxacin also holds an important place among fluoroquinolones in the treatment of c. trachomatis infections and uncomplicated pid, although its acceptance as monotherapy in pid is likely to depend on clarification of the causative role of anaerobic pathogens in this infection.
effect of therapeutic concentrations of nitric oxide on bacterial growth in vitro.
objectives: besides its vasodilative actions, nitric oxide (no) is also involved  in host defense on a cellular level. we studied the antimicrobial properties of no in concentrations used with inhaled no therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in neonates. design: in vitro study of bacterial growth of five species, with and without no exposure. setting: level iv neonatal intensive care unit at a university children's hospital. subjects: in vitro bacterial cultures. interventions: we tested ten different strains of five bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group b streptococcus [gbs/streptococcus agalactiae], escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), derived from the tracheal isolates of ventilated premature and term infants. cultures were exposed to three different concentrations of no (40, 80, and 120 parts per million [ppm]) and bacterial growth was compared with the same strains incubated in ambient air for 24 hrs. after incubation (with or without no), colony-forming units were counted. measurements and main results: bacterial growth of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa was not reduced with the no concentrations applied. the number of colony-forming units of s. aureus increased at 80 ppm of no. growth of s. epidermidis and gbs was significantly affected at 120 ppm, resulting in decreased numbers of colony-forming units as compared with controls exposed to ambient air. conclusions: we conclude that no has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of those bacteria most commonly cultured in tracheal specimens of premature infants and neonates. this effect appears to be dose-dependent and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled no therapy. however, in the range of dosages applied in ongoing controlled trials of inhaled no in neonates and premature infants (1 to 80 ppm), a bacteriostatic effect of no is not to be expected.
analysis of protease activity in human otitis media.
chronic otitis media is a common problem associated with a nonintact tympanic membrane frequently involving staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the virulence of pseudomonas bacteria is related to the production of two matrix metalloproteinases, elastase and alkaline protease. serine proteases, such as neutrophil elastase, are produced by the host inflammatory response. these proteases are thought to contribute to tissue destruction and assist bacterial invasion during infection. this preliminary study was done to identify protease activity in otorrhea samples from patients with otitis media and a nonintact tympanic membrane and to examine the ability of selective protease inhibitors to decrease protease activity. ilomostat (galardin) is a synthetic, specific inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases including p. aeruginosa elastase and alkaline protease, whereas alpha1-antitrypsin inhibits serine proteases including neutrophil elastase. samples were collected and cultured from 20 patients with otorrhea resulting from tympanic membrane perforations or pressure-equalization tubes. a protease assay that used azocasein as the substrate was used to quantify protease activity, with and without addition of selective protease inhibitors. cultures revealed p. aeruginosa alone in 7 samples, p. aeruginosa plus other organisms in 10, and s. aureus alone in 3. protease activity was detected in 15 (75%) of the samples. a statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in protease activity was seen with the addition of alpha1-antitrypsin or ilomostat plus alpha1-antitrypsin, but not with ilomostat alone. analyzing the 10 samples with the highest protease activity, a statistically significant decrease in activity was seen with ilomostat or alpha1-antitrypsin alone and with both ilomostat and alpha1-antitrypsin together. bacteriologic type, source of sample, age and gender of the subject, and duration of infection were not significantly related to protease activity. this is the first study to quantify protease activity and inhibition by selective protease inhibitors in human otorrhea. protease inhibitors effectively decrease protease activity in most cases and in addition to standard antibiotic therapy might prove beneficial in the treatment of otitis media with a nonintact tympanic membrane. this study supports future clinical investigations into the role of proteases and inhibition of protease activity in the treatment of otitis media.
antimicrobial resistance in bacterial chronic sinusitis.
recent reports describe the emergence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in acute sinusitis and an increased incidence of enteric gram negative bacilli in chronic sinusitis. the objective of this cross sectional study is to identify the emergent resistance patterns in bacterial chronic sinusitis. specifically, this article seeks to characterize the bacteriology of outpatient chronic sinusitis, then to compare the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the bacterial isolates with standard culture data from a tertiary care center. between march and august, 1994, 113 new outpatients presented with chronic sinusitis at a major teaching institution. of these patients 34 underwent endoscopically guided aerobic culture of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavities. of the 48 total cultures, there were 43 positive cultures yielding 72 isolates. thirty-eight cultures had two or fewer isolates; four cultures had three plus isolates, and one culture grew out normal flora. the most frequently isolated organisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (scn), 20 (28%); pseudomonas aeruginosa, 12 (17%); and staphylococcus aureus, 9 (13%). within the limited sample size for each isolate, staphylococcus coagulase negative, pseudomonas, and pneumococcus demonstrated higher antimicrobial resistance compared to the medical center's corresponding nonurinary isolates. additionally, three of six patients with pseudomonal aeruginosa (50%) had a quinolone resistant strain. these preliminary data suggest that both an increased incidence of antimicrobial resistance and of enteric gram negative bacilli may exist in these outpatient, tertiary care center patients with chronic bacterial sinusitis.
inhibition of bacterial adherence to a high-water-content polymer by a water-soluble, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug.
deposition and aggregation of lachrymal proteins on the contact lens surface can  promote bacterial adherence. lysozyme is the major tear protein and is also mainly responsible for the formation of protein deposits on contact lenses. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) prevent protein aggregation. the effect of a water-soluble nsaid drug on bacterial adherence to high-water-content/ionic disposable contact lenses was examined in a radiolabeling study. dose-related inhibition of adherence of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa on both pretreated lenses and after adding the drug to the medium was investigated. when the drug was added to the media, maximal inhibition of s. aureus adherence was observed in trypticase soy broth (59-98% at the lower and higher drug concentrations, respectively); inhibition progressively decreased in calf aqueous humor (48-75%), lysozyme (34-63%), and saline (12-20%) solutions. inhibition of adherence varied with the three bacterial species; it was maximal with s. aureus, intermediate with s. epidermidis, and minimal with p. aeruginosa. when lenses were pretreated with the drug, consistent, and even higher, inhibitory effects were observed. the results suggest that water-soluble nsaids could be used in preventive treatments for conjunctivae and corneal infections in contact lens wearers, and may provide a clue as to which compounds might inhibit protein interaction and bacterial adhesion.
bacterial pathogens (non-mycobacterium) from sputum culture and antimicrobial susceptibility.
sputum culture of patients at siriraj hospital, bangkok was 49.84% positive for bacterial pathogens in 1994 and 40.95% in 1995. the average incidence of gram-negative rods was 3.11 fold more than the combination of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci. the most common gram-negative rod was pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by either klebsiella pneumoniae or acinetobacter anitratus depending on year. the most common coccus was staphylococcus aureus. from both years, the number of haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and nocardia spp isolated were 122, 93, 13 and 11 strains respectively. for antimicrobial susceptibility, p. aeruginosa was sensitive to ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, netilmicin, ciprofloxacin (range 56-89%). s. aureus (mssa) was sensitive to common used drugs. s. aureus (mrsa) was sensitive to co-trimoxazole, fosfomycin, vancomycin (range 57-100%) and resistant to most drugs.
isolation, cdna cloning and gene expression of an antibacterial protein from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, oryctes rhinoceros.
an antibacterial protein, designated rhinocerosin, was purified to homogeneity from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, oryctes rhinoceros immunized with escherichia coli. based on the amino acid sequence of the n-terminal region, a degenerate primer was synthesized and reverse-transcriptase pcr was performed to clone rhinocerosin cdna. as a result, a 279-bp fragment was obtained. the complete nucleotide sequence was determined by sequencing the extended rhinocerosin cdna clone by 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends. the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature portion of rhinocerosin was composed of 72 amino acids without cystein residues and was shown to be rich in glycine (11.1%) and proline (11.1%) residues. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of rhinocerosin with those of other antibacterial proteins indicated that it has 77.8% and 44.6% identity with holotricin 2 and coleoptrecin, respectively. rhinocerosin had strong antibacterial activity against e. coli, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus but not against pseudomonas aeruginosa. results of reverse-transcriptase pcr analysis of gene expression in different tissues indicated that the rhinocerosin gene is strongly expressed in the fat body and the malpighian tubule, and weakly expressed in hemocytes and midgut. in addition, gene expression was inducible by bacteria in the fat body, the malpighian tubule and hemocyte but constitutive expression was observed in the midgut.
controlled comparative evaluation of bact/alert fan and esp 80a aerobic media as  means for detecting bacteremia and fungemia.
during a one-year period, a total of 6,305 blood cultures were processed in a tertiary-care teaching hospital; 6 to 12 ml of blood was inoculated into both a bact/alert fan aerobic bottle and an esp 80a aerobic bottle. the fan aerobic bottle contains an antimicrobial-absorbing material; the 80a aerobic bottle does not. bottles were processed on their respective continuous-monitoring blood culture instruments for up to five days of incubation. four hundred thirty-three cultures (6.9%) representing 301 septic episodes in 235 different patients yielded 490 bacteria or yeasts thought to be clinically significant. two hundred seventy-five of the 433 presumed clinically significant positive cultures (63.5%) representing 195 septic episodes and yielding 301 isolates were positive in both fan and 80a bottles. one hundred nine significant positive cultures (25.2%) (i.e., cultures positive with an organism judged to be of probable clinical significance) from 70 septic episodes yielded 126 isolates only in fan bottles. conversely, the 80a bottle was exclusively positive in 49 instances (11.3%), representing 36 septic episodes and yielding 63 isolates. the higher rates of significant positive blood cultures, numbers of septic episodes documented, and numbers of isolates recovered in fan bottles versus 80a bottles were all statistically significant (p < 0.05). enhanced rates of detection of presumed clinically significant isolates in fan bottles were largely accounted for by staphylococcus aureus, members of the enterobacteriaceae, and non-pseudomonas aeruginosa miscellaneous gram-negative bacilli from patients receiving antimicrobial therapy at the time blood cultures were obtained. enhanced recovery of one organism group, the beta-hemolytic streptococci, occurred in 80a. with one exception, detection times were essentially equivalent in the two systems. the single exception pertained to streptococci and enterococci, which were recovered significantly faster in 80a bottles. three hundred thirty-eight of the 6,305 blood cultures evaluated in this study (5.4%) were judged likely to be contaminated. the percentages of probable contaminated cultures were as follows: 26.6% fan and 80a; 42.3% fan only; 31.1% 80a only (p < 0.05). finally, the instrument false-positive rates for the two systems were 0.7% with fan and 3.0% with 80a (p < 0.05). we conclude that while contamination rates were slightly higher with fan than with 80a, use of fan aerobic bottles in conjunction with the bact/alert system will yield significantly higher numbers of clinically significant blood culture isolates than 80a bottles and the esp system. furthermore, this enhanced detection is most conspicuous in patients receiving antimicrobial therapy at the time blood cultures are performed, probably due to the presence of an antimicrobial-absorbing material in fan aerobic bottles.
toxicity of hydrogen peroxide produced by electroplated coatings to pathogenic bacteria.
the ability of various electroplated coatings (cobalt, zinc, copper, and cobalt-containing alloys of nickel, zinc, chromium, etc.) to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria (gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) was determined by a drop-method antibacterial experiment. the amounts of h2o2 produced and metal ions dissolved from the surfaces of various electroplated coatings were measured and it was found that the inhibitory ability of coatings corresponded to the amounts of h2o2 produced. the more significant the inhibition of the coating to bacterial growth, the greater the amount of h2o2 production. in addition, the bacterial survival rates on the surfaces of coatings were almost zero when h2o2 was produced in amounts greater than 10(-6) mmol/cm2. however, the dominant concentrations of metal ions dissolved from coatings were outside of the bacterial lethal range.
in vivo activity and pharmacokinetic evaluation of a novel long-acting carbapenem antibiotic, mk-826 (l-749,345).
mk-826 (formerly l-749,345), is a potent 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long half-life and broad spectrum of activity. this compound is presently in phase-ii clinical trials. its activity against a number of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was compared to those of imipenem (ipm) and eight other beta-lactam agents in two in vivo murine infection models. the distribution in tissue and pharmacokinetic properties of mk-826 and ceftriaxone (ctrx) were also evaluated in cd-1 mice following a single intraperitoneal dose (10 mg/kg of body weight). in addition, concentrations in plasma as well as biliary and urinary recovery of mk-826 were compared to that of ctrx in a cannulated rat model. in a localized murine thigh infection model, mk-826 and ipm were superior to a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics in reduction of staphylococcus aureus cfu compared with results from nontreated controls (eliminating >/=4 log10 cfu). similar activities of ipm and mk-826 were observed in a gram-positive bacterial murine systemic infection model. while ipm demonstrated greater efficacy than mk-826 against enterobacter cloacae (50% effective doses [ed50s] of 0.062 and 0.227 mg/kg, respectively) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (ed50s of 0.142 and 3.0 mg/kg, respectively) systemic infections, mk-826 was 8- to 350-fold more efficacious than ipm against all other gram-negative organisms in this infection model. in mice, mk-826 demonstrated a higher peak concentration in serum (62.8 versus 42.6 microg/ml) and a larger area under the curve (auc) (150.8 versus 90.0 microg . hr/ml) than ctrx. the concentrations of mk-826 and ctrx in serum declined slowly, with levels of 3.6 and 2.0 microg/ml remaining, respectively, at 6 h posttreatment. the rat pharmacokinetic model showed the average auc of mk-826 to be greater than that of ctrx (284 versus 142 microg . hr/ml) following a single 10-mg/kg dose. also, a half-life of mk-826 longer than that of ctrx (3.2 versus 2.3 h) was observed in this species. the total amount of drug excreted in the bile in 8 h was greater for ctrx (55 to 64% of the dose) than for mk-826 (6 to 12.5% of the dose). urinary recovery was similar for both antibiotics, with 16 to 18% of the dose recovered over an 8-h period. this excellent broad-spectrum in vivo efficacy of mk-826, together with advantageous pharmacokinetics, supports the argument for its further clinical development.
bacterial eradication by clinafloxacin, ci-990, and ciprofloxacin employing mbc test, in-vitro time-kill and in-vivo time-kill studies.
bactericidal activities of clinafloxacin, ci-990 and ciprofloxacin were examined  and compared for a small collection of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. in-vitro antimicrobial activities were measured by mic, mbc and time-kill studies; in-vivo efficacy of each drug was assessed in an acute lethal mouse infection model that monitored median protective dose, eradicative dose and time-kill in blood. in general, for all test methods, activity of clinafloxacin exceeded that of ci-990, which in turn exceeded that of ciprofloxacin. improvement in clinafloxacin and ci-990 activity over ciprofloxacin was more apparent against gram-positive cocci; differences were less noticeable against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. clinafloxacin activity was notably high against staphylococcus aureus and, against ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, this high activity was maintained in vitro and measurable activity was demonstrated in vivo.
synthesis and microbiological activity of some novel 5- or 6-methyl-2-(2,4-disubstituted phenyl) benzoxazole derivatives.
the synthesis of a new series of 5-or 6-methyl-2-(2,4-disubstituted phenyl) benzoxazoles (4, 5) is described in order to determine their antimicrobial activities and feasible structure-activity relationships. the synthesized compounds were tested in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria, three gram-negative bacteria and the yeast candida albicans, in comparison with several control drugs. microbiological results exhibited that the synthesized compounds possess a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms. the compounds 4b and 4c indicated some antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus having a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 12.5 micrograms/ml. moreover, the compound 5a revealed a significant antibacterial activity against the enterobacter pseudomonas aeruginosa showing a mic value of 25 micrograms/ml, i.e. more potent than the control drugs tetracycline and streptomycin. for the antimycotic activity against the yeast c. albicans, the derivative 4c was found to be more active than the other synthesized compounds with a mic value of 12.5 micrograms/ml, but one-fold less potent than the control drugs oxiconazole and haloprogin.
bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (united states and canada, 1997).
the sentry program was established in january 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the united states (30 sites), canada (8 sites), south america (10 sites), and europe (24 sites). during the first 6-month study period (january to june 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (bsi) were reported by north american sentry participants (4,119 from the united states and 939 from canada). in both the united states and canada, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common bsi isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10 most frequently reported species in both the united states and canada. although the rank orders of pathogens in the united states and canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several pathogens. overall, u.s. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from canada. the differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (meca, vana, and vanb) in the canadian microbial population. among u.s. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.
effects of copper and zinc ions on the germicidal properties of two popular pharmaceutical antiseptic agents cetylpyridinium chloride and povidone-iodine.
the effects of copper and zinc ions on the rate of killing of gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus and fungal yeast candida albicans by antiseptic agents cetylpyridinium chloride and povidone-iodine (betadine) were investigated. in the 48 test cases copper and zinc ions clearly potentiated the antiseptic agents in 28 (58.3%) cases and exhibited an improved (not clear potentiation) activity in 15 (31.3%) cases. in five (10.4%) cases there was no change in the antiseptics' antimicrobial activity. in general zinc potentiated the antiseptic agents more than copper. if an 'improved activity' was the only criterion for this study, then a more rapid antimicrobial effect was observed in 43 out of the 48 test cases, i.e., 90%.
synthesis, antimicrobial activity and bleaching effect of some reaction products  of 4-oxo-4h-benzopyran-3-carboxaldehydes with aminobenzothiazoles and hydrazides.
the synthesis of the biologically active novel systems derived from reaction of 3-formylchromones with three types of amino derivatives, 6-r2-2-aminobenzothiazoles, 6-amino-2-r3-thiobenzothiazoles and hydrazide derivatives (derived from cyanoacetic, isonicotine, salicylic and gallic acids) was carried out. the structures of the prepared compounds have been proved by elemental analysis, 1h nmr and ir spectra. antimicrobial activity was studied against the following microorganisms--bacteria g+ (staphylococcus aureus 29/58, bacillus subtilis 18/66), g- (escherichia coli 326/71, pseudomonas aeruginosa); yeasts: candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae; moulds: microsporum gypseum, aspergillus niger, scopulariopsis brevicaulis; and against typical and atypical mycobacteria: mycobacterium tuberculosis (h37rv), mycobacterium kansasii (pfg 8), mycobacterium avium (my 80/72), mycobacterium fortuitum (1021). the hereditary bleaching effect on the plastid system of euglena gracilis, a unique phenomenon of the biological activity of chromone derivatives, is reported. the bleaching test on e. gracilis is used for detecting extranuclear mutations.
antimicrobial activity of antiseptic-coated orthopaedic devices.
antimicrobial coating of medical devices, including fracture fixation devices, has evolved as a potentially effective method for preventing device-related infections. we examined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of titanium cylinders coated with the antiseptic combination of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol. the coated devices provided zones of inhibition against staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and candida albicans, at baseline and up to 8 weeks after incubation of the coated cylinders in human serum at 37 degrees c. this durable antimicrobial activity was attributed to the relatively slow leaching of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol from the coated cylinders as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. these results suggest that antiseptic-coated orthopaedic devices may provide broad-spectrum and durable antimicrobial protection against device-related infection.
comparative in-vitro activity of cefpirome against isolates from intensive care and haematology/oncology units. belgian multicentre study group.
the susceptibility of 389 enterobacteriaceae, 231 other gram-negative bacilli (including 150 pseudomonas aeruginosa) and 233 gram-positive organisms was determined by the nccls reference microdilution technique against cefpirome and other antibiotics. cefpirome and cefepime were the most active compounds against enterobacteriaceae, including potentially beta-lactamase-inducible species. the mic90 of cefpirome against potentially inducible and non-inducible species of enterobacteriaceae was 2 mg/l and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime, cefpirome and cefepime had similar activity against p. aeruginosa, with mic90s of 64 mg/l, 64 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively. cefpirome and cefepime had similar activity against gram-positive cocci, with mic90s of 1 mg/l and 2 mg/l, respectively, against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and 64 mg/l and 128 mg/l, respectively, against enterococcus spp.; both had an mic90 of 1 mg/l against streptococcus pneumoniae. this study shows that fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefpirome, could be useful in haematology/oncology units and, in particular, icus where high resistance rates are observed.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996), iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 hospitals during june 1996 to may 1997, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. e. faecalis among e. faecalis strains, those with high susceptibilities to ampicillin and minocycline appeared to have decreased in the latest study period. 2. s. aureus to almost antimicrobial agents, s. aureus isolated from uncomplicated utis showed low susceptibilities. but the mic50s of those agents for s. aureus from complicated utis have changed better state. particularly, the mic50s of imipenem and clindamycin were 0.125 microgram/ml or below in the latest period for the first time in our history. 3. e. coli the susceptibilities to piperacillin and quinolones of e. coli isolated from uncomplicated utis were better than those isolated from complicated utis. 4. klebsiella spp. the susceptibilities to almost antimicrobial agents of klebsiella spp. have been better during the latest period, compared to those during period of 1995-1996, but to ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin have appeared to have been lower. 5. p. aeruginosa the susceptibilities to quinolones of p. aeruginosa have been better during the latest period compared those during periods of 1995-1996. but, the susceptibilities to cefozopran, carbapenems and monobactams of p. aeruginosa isolated from complicated utis appeared to have been lower. these susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
antibacterial activity of rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium tripodal phosphine complexes.
twenty-eight rhodium, iridium, or ruthenium complexes were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonaa aeruginosa atcc 27853. ten compounds showed an antibacterial activity against enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 with a range of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) between 16 and 125 micrograms/ml. none of the compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative strains e. coli atcc 25922 or pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 29213 with a concentration range between 4 and 500 micrograms/ml.
[the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefozopran against clinically isolated bacteria].
the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefozopran (czop) against recent clinical  isolates was evaluated and compared with those of ceftazidime (caz), cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), cefotaxime (ctx), sulbactam/cefoperazone (s/c), imipenem (ipm), oxacillin (mpipc), and flomoxef (fmox). mic80 values of czop for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, n = 41), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, n = 57), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 45), enterococus faecalis (n = 49), enterobacter cloacae (n = 50), citrobacter freundii (n = 45), serratia marcescens (n = 45), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 100) were 1, 32, 2, 16, 4, 1, 0.25, 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. czop was more active than cpr against p. aeruginosa and exhibited similar activity to cpr against other species. czop was especially active against s. marcescens with mic values lower than 1 microgram/ml against all strains tested. czop was similarly active to or more active than cfpm against all species except for c. freundii. czop was not active against mrsa. thus, we investigated the in vitro combination effects of czop/vancomycin (vcm) and czop/arbekacin (abk) using the checkerboard method. the interaction between czop and vcm ranged from additive activity (0.5 < fic index < or = 1.00, n = 37) to synergistic activity (fic index < 0.50, n = 1), except for one strain showing indifference (1.00 < fic index < or = 2.00). the interaction between czop and abk ranged from additive activity (n = 22) to synergistic activity (n = 1). these date suggest the potential effect of combination therapy of (czop) and vcm or abk against mrsa. the combined therapy is suggested to be useful to reduce side effects in patients with impared renal function, to reduce the administration dose of vcm or to treat infections of sites where achievable drug concentrations are lower than those commonly achieved in the bloodstream. we also investigated the combination effects of czop/amk and czop/gm against czop-resistant p. aeruginosa (mic > 16 micrograms/ml). the combination of czop/amk showed additive activity (n = 9) to synergistic activity (n = 2). the combination of czop/gm showed additive activity (n = 5). these results suggest that combinations of czop with amk or gm are effective in treating p. aeruginosa.
antibacterial and chemical evaluation of chromolaena moritziana.
chromolaena moritziana (sch. bip. ex hieron.) king & robin. (asteraceae) is used  in local ethnomedicine as an anticatarrhal, a depurative and in the treatment of skin diseases. this ethnopharmacological information has a direct correlation with that reported for other chromolaena species. dichloromethane and aqueous extracts from the leaves as well as ethyl acetate extracts from the flowers have shown antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and a uv-v light effect was not observed against this bacterium. these results may justify the ethnomedical use in skin infections. the flavonoids kaempferol, kaempferol-3-o-rutinoside, rutin and isoquercitrin as well as the triterpene alpha-amyrin were isolated.
[urinary bacteria in elderly patients with urinary incontinence and low levels of daily activity].
the results of bacteria isolated from the urine of inactive elderly patients with urinary incontinence in 1982, 87, 93 and 95 were compared and the chronological changes of urinary bacteria were analyzed. the following results were obtained: (1) the most common bacteria isolated from the patients in 1995 were d-group enterococcus, followed by providencia rettgeri, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. it is thought that the main cause of the more frequent isolation of enterococcus is an abuse of cephems and fecal contamination. (2) the most common bacteriaisolated from the patients who were managed with an indwelling urethral catheter were proteus and providencia species, and their incidence tended to decrease from 1982 to 1995. (3) infection with pseudomonas species tended to increase, as did that staphylococcus species, especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and then decreased. based on these findings, it is important to assess and treat dysuria before inserting an indwelling urethral catheter, and to select an antibacterial agent that is effective in elderly patients with urinary incontinence and limited activity.
in vitro activity of fosfomycin trometamol against pathogens from urinary tract infections: a spanish multicenter study.
the in-vitro susceptibilities of a total of 1371 urinary tract pathogens to fosfomycin trometamol were determined. according to the nccls breakpoints, enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive microorganisms were, in general, very sensitive to this antimicrobial. more than 90.0% of the escherichia coli and citrobacter spp. and more than 70.0% of the klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus spp. strains tested were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. strains were more resistant. in general, recent clinical isolates from urinary tract infections (utis) in both community and hospital were also very sensitive (> 80.0%) to fosfomycin, its activity being higher than that of the rest of the antimicrobials commonly used for therapy of uncomplicated utis. more than 75.0% of the most frequently isolated pathogens from utis, except for p. aeruginosa (31.8%) and acinetobacter spp. (11.1%), were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. the results obtained in this study, together with the infrequency of side effects and its pharmacokinetic properties, indicate that fosfomycin trometamol may be a useful alternative for single-dose therapy of uncomplicated utis.
in vitro determination of direct antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
the objective of this study was to determine in vitro the time required for calcium hydroxide in direct contact with microorganisms to express its antimicrobial effect. the microorganisms used were: micrococcus luteus (atcc-9341), staphylococcus aureus (atcc-6538), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc-25586), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc-27853), escherichia coli, and streptococcus sp. the strains were cultivated in brain heart infusion (bhi), with the exception of f. nucleatum (bhi-pras). pure and mixed suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared. paper cones immersed in these substances were covered with calcium hydroxide paste, and after 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days they were transferred to an appropriate medium to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. incubation was conducted at 37 degrees c for 48 h, according to the requirements of oxygen of each microorganism. the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide was shown to occur after 12 h on m. luteus and f. nucleatum, 24 h on streptococcus sp, 48 h on e. coli, and 72 h on s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. mixture ii (m. luteus + streptococcus sp + s. aureus) was sensitive to calcium hydroxide antimicrobial potential after 48 h, whereas mixture i (m. luteus + e. coli + p. aeruginosa), mixture iii (e. coli + p. aeruginosa), and mixture iv (s. aureus + p. aeruginosa) were inactivated after 72 h of exposure.
silvazine (silver sulfadiazine and chlorhexidine) activity against 200 clinical isolates.
the study was undertaken to examine the in vitro efficacy of silvazine against micro-organisms commonly found in burn wounds. two hundred non-replicative sequential clinical isolates were collected over a 2-month period. these comprised 50 staphylococcus aureus (methicillin sensitive), 50 staphylococcus aureus (methicillin resistant), 50 coagulase negative staphylococci and 50 pseudomonas aeruginosa. as there is no standard test method, the method chosen was a pour plate overlay of micro-organisms placed on a mueller hinton base containing duplicate wells of 0.1 ml silvazine. plates were incubated at 35 degrees c for up to 48 h prior to examination. all organisms tested showed zones of growth inhibition. the mean diameters of the zones of growth inhibition were similar within genera. s. aureus 19.7 +/- 1.6 mm, mrsa 16.9 +/- 1.6 mm, p.aeruginosa 15.3 +/- 1.1 mm and coagulase negative staphylococci 20.8 +/- 2.1 mm. there was no bacterial regrowth within the zones of growth inhibition following long-term plate storage. in vitro testing of silvazine has confirmed its efficiency against common burn wound isolates.
in-vitro photobactericidal activity of aminoacridines.
the toxicities of several aminoacridines were measured against pathogenic strains of both gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) organisms. in several cases, illumination at a light dose of 6.3 j/cm2 resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal drug concentrations required, giving up to 50-fold increases in bactericidal activity. derivatives of 9-aminoacridine (aminacrine) exhibited phototoxicity against one or more of the test organisms, but the established photosensitizing acridines proflavine and acridine orange were photobactericidal against all strains.
the antibacterial activity of topical anesthetics.
purpose: topical anesthetics are commonly used prior to obtaining bacterial cultures in ulcerative keratitis. we performed an in vitro study designed to test both the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of commercially available preserved topical anesthetic agents. methods: proparacaine, tetracaine, cocaine, and sterile water solutions were applied to filter paper disks, which were then placed on mueller-hinton agar plates that had previously been inoculated with known quantities of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. after 24 h of incubation, zones of inhibition were measured and recorded. results: proparacaine strongly inhibited the growth of s. aureus at all concentrations (0.5%, 0.25%, 0.125%) and inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa at 0.5% and 0.25% but not at 0.125% concentration. tetracaine also inhibited s. aureus at 0.5% and inhibited p. aeruginosa at 0.5% and 0.25% concentrations. cocaine exhibited no inhibition of s. aureus and exhibited mild inhibition of p. aeruginosa growth only at the 4% concentration. conclusions: the in vitro antibacterial effect of topical anesthetics suggests one possible reason why bacterial culture yields in clinical ulcerative keratitis are suboptimal. we propose that clinicians consider the use of a 1% or 2% cocaine solution instead of standard commercial topical anesthetics in the management of individual cases of ulcerative keratitis and in future clinical bacterial keratitis studies.
comparative in vitro activity of cefepime against nosocomial isolates.
cefepime, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated for its in vitro antibacterial activity in comparison with other broad-spectrum antibiotics against a total of 445 recently isolated microorganisms of nosocomial origin. cefepime was highly active against all species of enterobacteriaceae with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90s) ranging from 0.25-8 micrograms/ml. cefepime showed moderate activity against acinetobacter spp (mic50 and mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) but its activity was superior to that of any drug tested, except imipenem. against pseudomonas aeruginosa its activity was comparable to that of ceftazidime and was greater than that of cefotaxime, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides. of all the agents tested, imipenem was the most active compound. cefepime was active against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative methicillin-susceptible staphylococci but it had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci.
a xanthanolide with potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
this study was conducted to find constituents of an annual herb, xanthium sibiricum patr er widd, with effective antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). by monitoring antibacterial activity against mrsa strains, it was shown that a sesquiterpene lactone, identified as [3ar-(3a alpha, 7 beta,8a beta)]-3,3a,4,7,8,8a-hexahydro-7- methyl-3-methylene-6-(3-oxo-1-butenyl)-2h-cyclohepta[b]furan-2-one, or xanthatin, isolated from leaves of the herb, had outstandingly potent activity against s. aureus species, including mrsa; its activity against mrsa and mssa strains was similar. other bacteria, e.g. staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi, were also susceptible at the concentrations tested but the compound had no inhibitory effect on some other bacteria, including escherichia coli. the results show that xanthatin has outstandingly potent activity against strains of s. aureus but that the activity of the compound is highly species-specific.
pseudomonas aeruginosa and cystic fibrosis: antibiotic therapy and the science behind the magic.
respiratory failure secondary to chronic bronchiectasis is the cause of death in  more than 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). the predominant microbes involved in cf lung disease are unusual: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and burkolderia cepacia. while antimicrobial therapy has been a component of cf care programs for decades, randomized controlled studies in the 1980s and early 1990s failed to show consistent measurable benefit. research that stemmed from the discovery of the cf gene has shed new light on the inter-relationship of these microbes and the respiratory epithelial lung changes secondary to the cf gene. five mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increased p aeruginosa colonization of the lower airway in cf. recent research has also shown that antimicrobial therapy in cf may be effective not through eradication of the organism but by decreasing bacterial density and exoproduct production in the lung and thus decreasing inflammatory stimulus; by protecting against the consequences of an overexhuberant host response and in patients with stop mutations, potentially by correcting the gene defect. this tale of misunderstanding of the role and value of antimicrobial therapy in cf care illustrates the importance of ensuring close communiation between clinicians and researchers. the randomized controlled studies of the 1980s were not designed to answer the 'right' questions. the clinicians' observations that the cf patients did improve with antimicrobial therapy have been validated by recent studies using different endpoints.
antibacterial properties of bo-2727, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
bo-2727 is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic with broad-spectrum, potent antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activities of bo-2727 were compared with those of meropenem, imipenem and biapenem. bo-2727 was four- to eight-fold more active in vitro than meropenem, imipenem and biapenem against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, inhibiting more than 90% of clinical isolates at a concentration of 12.5 mg/l. bo-2727 also showed superior activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against imipenem-resistant strains. the antimicrobial activity of bo-2727 was influenced by the ph of the medium and inoculum size, in the same way as meropenem and imipenem. in time-killing kinetic studies, bo-2727 showed dose-dependent bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. in a morphological study, bo-2727 induced spherical forms in e. coli and bulging forms in p. aeruginosa. the affinity of bo-2727 for e. coli (pbp 2) was about twice that of imipenem. bo-2727 also had high affinities for p. aeruginosa penicillin-binding protein (pbps) 2 and 3. the prophylactic efficacy of bo-2727 against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial systemic infections was similar to that of imipenem and biapenem.
the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells (m. f. bernet, d. brassard, j. r. neeser, and a. l. servin, gut 35:483-489, 1994). here, we demonstrate that strain la1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected by salmonella typhimurium. we present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain la1 (la1-scs) contained antibacterial components active against s. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. by contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.
antimicrobial activities of squalamine mimics.
we investigated the antimicrobial properties of compounds with structural features that were designed to mimic those of squalamine, an antibiotic isolated from the stomach of the dogfish shark. the mimics, like squalamine, are sterol-polyamine conjugates. unlike squalamine, the mimics were simple to prepare, at high yield, from readily available starting materials. several squalamine mimics showed activity against gram-negative rods, gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and fungi. some had little or no hemolytic activity. the hydrophobicity of the sterol backbone and the length and the cationic charge of the side chains appeared to be critical determinants of activity. one of the squalamine mimics, sm-7, was bactericidal against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and s. aureus; its activity was decreased by divalent or monovalent cations and by bovine serum albumin. subinhibitory concentrations of sm-7 markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of rifampin against gram-negative rods. these results suggest that the compounds may disrupt an outer membrane of gram-negative rods. squalamine mimics are a new class of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. the antagonism of their activity by serum and albumin and their hemolytic properties may limit their use as systemic agents. the squalamine mimics, because of their potencies, broad spectra of antimicrobial activity, and potential for systemic toxicity, appear to be good candidates for development as topical antimicrobial agents.
does tea tree oil have a place in the topical treatment of burns?
burnaid is a sorbalene-based cream containing 40 mg/g of tea tree oil and 1 mg/g  of triclosan. this investigation was carried out to determine the effect of burnaid, a commercial tea tree oil preparation, against enterococcus faecalis (atcc29212), staphylococcus aureus (atcc29213), escherichia coli (atcc25922), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc27853), with the activity of the base product in the commercial preparation. the organisms were suspended in sterile saline (0.5 mcfarland standard) and inoculated onto horse blood agar (e. faecalis and s. aureus) or mueller-hinton agar (e. coli and p. aeruginosa). one hundred microliters of burnaid unsterilized, burnaid sterilized and the base product (tinasolve) were placed in duplicate in wells cut into the agar plates. sterility and inactivation cultures were also performed on the samples. none of the samples were found to be contaminated with bacteria prior to testing. only s. aureus and e. coli showed zones of growth inhibition around the burnaid and tinasolve. zones of growth inhibition (22 mm) were similar for the active product (burnaid) and the base (tinasolve). there was no activity against e. faecalis or p. aeruginosa. in view of our findings and literature indicating the cytotoxicity of tea tree oil against human fibroblasts and epithelial cells, it is recommended that this product should not be used on burn wounds.
antibacterial activity of trovafloxacin against nosocomial gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
a total of 1132 clinical isolates from 952 patients with nosocomial infections were tested against the fluoroquinolone trovafloxacin by the agar dilution method. they comprised 285 staphylococci, 111 streptococci, 94 enterococci and 470 isolates of enterobacteriaceae, 92 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 27 stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 28 haemophilus influenzae and 25 acinetobacter calcoaceticus. the in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside agents. over 96% of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to trovafloxacin with an mic of <0.03-4 mg/l. it also inhibited 97% and 100% clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia, respectively. all staphylococci, including 51 strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, were susceptible to trovafloxacin, which also had excellent activity against streptococci and enterococci, inhibiting all 111 strains of the former and 94% of the latter. trovafloxacin had a greater activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria than ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, penicillins, cephalosporins and the aminoglycosides tested.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1995)].
the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 567 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 459 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october 1995 to september 1996. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 74 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 82 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 104 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 85 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 18 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 52 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 52.7%. arbekacin (abk) showed the most highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of 0.5 micrograms/ml. vancomycin (vcm) showed the next highest activity with mic80 of 1 microgram/ml. these drugs showed the high activities against mrsa with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. 2) s. pneumoniae. most of drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm), carbapenems, showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefotaxime (ctx), cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefpirome (cpr) of cephems showed the next most potent activities with mic80s of 0.25 microgram/ml. erythromycin (em) and clindamycin (cldm) showed low activities with mic80s 128 micrograms/ml or high. among these strains, however, 48.8% and 65.9% of respective strains were quite toward sensitive these agents with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3) h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae test with all mics at 4 micrograms/ml or below. cefotiam (ctm), cmx, cefditoren (cdtr) and ofloxacin (oflx) showed the most potent activity with mic90s to 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) p. aeruginosa. (mucoid strains) ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. ceftazidime (caz), cefsulodin (cfs) and carumonam (crmn) showed next potent activity, with mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 32 micrograms/ml. 5) p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. the mic80 of ampicillin (abpc) was 128 micrograms/ml in 1994, it was 16 micrograms/ml in 1995. 6) k. pneumoniae. all drugs except abpc were active against k. pneumoniae. cpr and crmn showed the most potent activities against k. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 0.125 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) m. (b.) catarrhalis. against m. (b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities with mic80s at 4 micrograms/ml or below. and mics of all strains were 8 micrograms/ml or below. ipm, oflx and minocycline (mino) showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. patients' backgrounds were examine for 567 isolates from 459 cases. the examination of age distribution found that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 66.3% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. proportion of differe
antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). iii. differences in susceptibilities from previous years].
susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 11 hospitals during june, 1995 through may, 1996, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. macrolide resistant e. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated utis during the latest study period appeared to have increased compared to those in previous study periods. more than 50% of the isolated e. faecalis during the latest study period were resistant to macrolide antibiotics, for the first time in our history. 2. no obvious changes were observed through the years for susceptibilities of s. aureus to various antimicrobial agents. vancomycin (vcm) showed the highest activity against s. aureus, with mics below 2 micrograms/ml or below. 3. among e. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones appeared to have increased over the years with mic90 changed from between 0.125 microgram/ml or below and 0.5 microgram/ml in the 1989-1990 period to between 8 micrograms/ml and 128 micrograms/ml in the latest study period. 4. klebsiella spp. showed higher resistance to most antimicrobial agents during periods of 1993-1994 and 1994-1995, but somewhat lower resistance during period of 1995-1996. no resistant klebsiella spp. were detected from uncomplicated utis during the latest study period. 5. among p. aeruginosa isolates from complicated utis, resistance isolates to gentamicin appeared to be increasing over the years. resistant strains to quinolones were isolated at lower frequencies during periods of 1991-1994, but higher frequency was observed in the latest period, and mic50s were between 0.5 and 4 micrograms/ml during 1991-1994, but were 16-32 micrograms/ml during 1995-1996. these susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
comparative studies of the bactericidal, morphological and post-antibiotic effects of arbekacin and vancomycin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
arbekacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, has antibacterial activity against both  gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and is stable in the presence of aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes produced by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in this report, the antibacterial activity of arbekacin was compared with that of vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic that also has potent antibacterial activity against mrsa. arbekacin showed concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against mrsa strain 1936 (0.5-2 x mic), but vancomycin showed only slight bactericidal activity, even at high concentrations of 19 x mic. arbekacin showed a longer post-antibiotic effect (2.3-3.8 h) than vancomycin (0-1.3 h) against mrsa strain 1936. arbekacin induced marked morphological changes at 0.5 x mic and the changes remained for 2 h after removal of the agent. when exposed to 0.5 x mic of vancomycin, no notable morphological change was observed in the treated cells. since arbekacin has broad-spectrum activity, these findings suggest that it may be a useful agent against mrsa infection, especially for polymicrobial mrsa infection with gram-negative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone cg 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
the in-vitro activity of cg 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. cg 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being enterobacter spp. (mic90 2 mg/l) and serratia spp. (mic90 4 mg/l). ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/l respectively. cg 5501 had high activity against gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/l. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of cg 5501. isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 (mic90 0.5 mg/l) than to ciprofloxacin (mic90 4 mg/l) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. cg 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90 0.25 mg/l). five strains of chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l of cg 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/l of cg 5501. the high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that cg 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.
role of physiological conditions in the oropharynx on the adherence of respiratory bacterial isolates to endotracheal tube poly(vinyl chloride).
pneumonia is a major problem in intensive care patients and can be induced by pathogenic bacteria adhering to poly(vinyl chloride) (pvc) endotracheal (et) tubes. this study examines the influence of surface properties on the adherence of the respiratory isolates staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa to pvc. in particular, the influence of respiratory tract physiological conditions, 5% co2 and saliva, on adherence was investigated. in general, decreased adherence to pvc was observed when bacteria were grown in co2. when these co2-grown bacteria were treated with saliva their adherence to pvc significantly increased; however, their adherence was significantly reduced to saliva-treated pvc. treatment of both bacterial isolates with saliva decreased their negative zeta potential, a factor which may directly contribute to the observed increased microbial (saliva pretreated) adherence to pvc. cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) was evaluated by measuring the initial rates of microbial removal from a buffered aqueous phase, to ensure the absence of electrostatic interactions, to an organic phase (xylene). under physiological conditions, csh did not appear to be a dominant factor in biomaterial adherence as the csh of s. aureus was decreased by saliva treatment but was unchanged for ps. aeruginosa. additionally, csh also differed for the two isolates when grown in co2, significantly decreasing with s. aureus but remaining unaltered with ps. aeruginosa. saliva treatment of pvc also decreased the advancing and receding contact angles of the biomaterial and its surface roughness, which may be a factor in the decreased adherence of saliva-treated bacteria to this surface. alternative biomaterials or surface modifications appear necessary for the desired improvements in et tube effectiveness. this study highlights the influence of physiological conditions on biomaterial and bacterial surface characteristics and subsequent interactions. it is imperative that the physiological conditions predominating in the clinical area of biomaterial use be considered when investigating device biocompatibility.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of er-35786, a new antipseudomonal  carbapenem.
er-35786 is a new parenteral 1 beta-methyl carbapenem with a broad antibacterial  spectrum and a potent antipseudomonal activity. it showed high in vitro activity, comparable to those of meropenem and a new carbapenem, bo-2727, against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, with mics at which 90% of strains tested are inhibited (mic90s) of < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. against methicillin-resistant s. aureus, er-35786 was the most active among the compounds tested, yet its mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae, er-35786 inhibited 90% of strains tested at a concentration of < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. the mic90 of er-35786 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 3.13 micrograms/ml, and the compound was more active than meropenem. in addition, the activity of er-35786 against imipenem-, meropenem-, cefclidin-, or ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa was equal to or higher than that of the most active reference compound. the in vivo activity of er-35786 was consistent with this in vitro activity. the in vivo activity of er-35786 was highest for systemic infection models with methicillin-resistant s. aureus and beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa strains. in acute pneumonia caused by p. aeruginosa, er-35786 produced a greater reduction in the viable cell count in the lungs than did imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem.
structural and biological behaviour of co(ii), cu(ii) and ni(ii) metal complexes  of some amino acid derived schiff-bases.
biologically active tridentate amino acid (alanine, glycine & tyrosine) derived schiff-bases and their co(ii), cu(ii) & ni(ii) complexes have been synthesised and characterised on the basis of their conductance and magnetic measurements, elemental analysis and (13)c-nmr, (1)h-nmr, ir and electronic spectral data. these schiff-bases and their complexes have been evaluated for their antibacterial activity against bacterial species such as staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonae, proteus vulgarus and pseudomonas aeruginosa and this activity data show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial than the schiff-bases against one or more bacterial species.
loss of bactericidal activity from contact lens storage solutions.
purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of lens storage on  the bactericidal activities of disinfecting solutions. methods: hydrocurveii (55% water content) soft contact lenses were soaked in opti-free rinsing, disinfecting, and storage solution (preserved with polyquaternium-1 [pq-1]) or renu multi-purpose solution (polyaminopropyl biguanide [phmb]). after the lenses were removed, solutions were challenged with pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. uptake of the antimicrobial agents by the lenses was evaluated by placing the lenses on plates seeded with s. aureus and observing for zones of growth inhibition. results: the bactericidal activity of the phmb preserved solution decreased after 4 hours of storage time and showed no activity after storage for 3 days. lenses soaked in the phmb preserved solution produced zones of inhibition. the results suggest that the phmb in the solution accumulates in the lens. this decreases the levels of preservative in the solution that is no longer available during lens storage. neither decrease in bactericidal activity nor accumulation of the pq-1 preservative in the lens occurred during storage with the pq-1 solution. conclusion: these results demonstrate that pq-1 preserved solutions maintain bactericidal activity overnight and during prolonged storage without detectable uptake by lenses.
antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime in vitro.
cefpodoxime proxetil is a new orally administered prodrug which is absorbed and de-esterified by the intestinal mucosa to release the third-generation cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, and which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method, we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and quinolones against 637 recent clinical isolates from kaohsiung veterans general hospital in taiwan. against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, cefpodoxime showed excellent activity, inhibiting over 90% of these isolates at 1 mg/l. like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. against haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparative drugs. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, cefpodoxime showed moderate activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas it was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. however, all cephalosporins have shown little in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus regardless of in vitro results. cefpodoxime was inactive against enterococcus spp. against other streptococci, its activity was similar to other oral cephalosporins and quinolones tested. the results of this in vitro study indicated that oral administration of cefpodoxime should be an ideal agent in the empirical outpatient treatment for community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone.
the in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone, was studied in comparison with those of ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin (cp 99,219), cefpodoxime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate against gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria. its activity against mycobacteria and chlamydia was also investigated. bay 12-8039 was active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of strains tested were inhibited [mic90s] < or = 1 microgram/ml, except for serratia spp. mic90 2 microgram/ml), neisseria spp. (mic90s, 0.015 microgram/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.12 micrgram/ml), and these results were comparable to those obtained for ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the quinolones were more active than the beta-lactam agents but bay 12-8039 was less active than ciprofloxacin. strains of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were fourfold more susceptible to bay 12-8039 and trovafloxacin (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml) than to ciprofloxacin. bay 12-8039 was as active as trovafloxacin but more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus auerus (mic90s, 0.12 micrograms/ml). the activity of bay 12-8039 against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml) was lower than that against methicillin-susceptible strains. bay 12-8039 was active against anaerobes (mic90s < or = 2 micrograms/ml), being three- to fourfold more active against bacteroides fragilis, prevotella spp., and clostridium difficile than was ciprofloxacin. against mycobacterium tuberculosis, bay 12-8039 exhibited activity comparable to that of rifampin (mics < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml). against chlamydia trachomatis and chlamydia pneumoniae bay 12-8039 was more active (mics < or = 0.12 microgram/ml) than either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin and exhibited a greater lethal effect than either to these two agents. the protein binding of bay 12-8039 was determined at 1 and 5 micrograms/ml as 30 and 26.4%, respectively. the presence of human serum (at 20 or 70%) had no marked effect on the in vitro activity of bay 12-8039.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of electron rich olefin derived cyclic ureas.
seventeen cyclic ureas containing imidazolidine and benzimidazoline nuclei were synthesised by the reaction of electron-rich olefins with appropriate group 16 elements. (o, s, se, te). the compounds synthesised were identified by 1h, 13c-nmr, ft-ir and mass spectroscopic techniques and micro analysis. all compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against standard strains: enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853). eight of the compounds were found effective to inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus) at mic values between 25-400 micrograms/ml. none of the compounds exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) at the concentrations studied (6.25-800 micrograms/ml).
evaluation of susceptibility of gram-positive and -negative bacteria to human defensins by using radial diffusion assay.
defensins are small cationic bactericidal peptides present abundantly in the granules of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns). human pmns contain four defensins termed hnp-1 to hnp-4. we used a new assay system in agar plates, the radial diffusion assay, to evaluate the effects of human defensins against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. a crude mixture of hnp-1, -2, and -3 (crude hnps) was purified from human pmn extracts by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (rp-hplc). the different components were later separated by rp-hplc and gel permeation chromatography. we compared the antibacterial activities of purified hnp-1, -2, and -3 against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains using the radial diffusion assay. the antibacterial activities of hnp-1 and hnp-2 against all strains tested were similar to those of the crude hnps, but the activity of hnp-3 was less than those of the other defensins. to quantitate the activities of hnps against different bacteria, we defined the minimal dose of crude hnps forming a detectable clear zone around the bacteria as the minimal inhibitory dose (mid) and determined the mids for 10 strains of e. coli, 12 strains of p. aeruginosa, 10 strains of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and 12 strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates, including clinical isolates. in general, the mids of the hnps were similar against similar bacterial species. however, the mids for p. aeruginosa were higher than those for the other organisms tested. the radial diffusion assay is suitable as a screening test for measuring the susceptibilities of isolates to defensins, because it is sensitive and simple and has good reproducibility.
in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.
antibiotic supplementation of intraocular irrigating solutions. an in vitro model of antibacterial action.
purpose: the addition of antibiotics to infusion solutions for cataract surgery is becoming increasingly popular. the authors developed an in vitro model to evaluate antibacterial effects of this use of antibiotics. methods: clinical isolates and/or reference strains of the following organisms were examined: coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus spp, enterococcus spp, proprionibacterium acnes, moraxella nonliquifaciens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. standardized suspensions of each organism were incubated with a control solution (balanced salt solution) or balanced salt solution containing the following antibiotics: vancomycin (20 micrograms/ml) or gentamicin (8 micrograms/ml) or gentamicin and vancomycin combined (8 and 20 micrograms/ml, respectively). suspensions were incubated for 30, 60, and 120 minutes at room temperature. samples were centrifuged, and the organisms were washed with balanced salt solution before quantitative culturing. each organism also was incubated for 48 hours in mueller-hinton broth with the same antibiotic concentrations. results: most of the organisms were not affected by exposure to the antibiotics for up to 140 minutes. p. aeruginosa and m. nonliquifaciens were exceptions, decreasing in colony numbers even with 30 minutes of exposure. several staphylococcus spp yielded variable results. all organisms demonstrated nearly complete inhibition of growth when exposed for an extended time to the appropriate antibiotic in broth. conclusions: exposure to antibiotics for a short period of time, such as during intraocular surgery, generally has no effect on organisms commonly responsible for endophthalmitis. the use of antibiotics in this manner should be critically reassessed until further study.
note: microbial resistance of wool fabric treated with bis-quats compounds.
in this paper, the antibacterial activity against bacillus pumilus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa of the wool fabrics treated with new antimicrobial bis-quaternary surfactants, dabk and dabb, is studied. the activity was established on the basis of the agar diffusion and protective antibacterial test results and on the basis of scanning electron microscopy (sem) observation. the results were compared with the htab, a monoquaternary surfactant of conventional use. the results from the agar diffusion and protective antibacterial tests do not enable us to confirm whether these compounds are potentially useful antimicrobial agents for the protection of textiles. however, sem observations show clearly the efficacy of these compounds to protect the wool fabrics against the micro-organisms. sem has been a useful technique for the assessment of antibacterial activity in textiles.
screening of some cuban medicinal plants for antimicrobial activity.
the antimicrobial activities of 23 extracts of 12 cuban plant species reported in traditional medicine were tested. the agar diffusion method was used to assess the activity against four bacteria and one yeast: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the results, evaluated as the diameter of the inhibition zone of microbial growth, showed that nine extracts were active against gram-positive bacteria but only two of these proved to be also active against gram-negative bacteria. none of the extracts inhibited the growth of the yeast. the most susceptible bacterium was staphylococcus aureus and the best antibacterial activity was shown by schinus terebenthifolius.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
susceptibilities of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 hospitals during june 1994 to may 1995 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated utis, complicated utis without indwelling catheter, and complicated utis with indwelling catheter. no remarkable changes were found in susceptibilities of citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. the susceptibilities of e. faecalis to amikacin and quinolones were better than those in 1993. as for s. aureus, susceptible strains to all drugs increased in uncomplicated utis. against e. coli in 1993, the antimicrobial activities of piperacillin, cefotiam and aminoglycosides have decreased, however, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. as for klebsiella spp. susceptible strains to abpc decreased. the susceptibilities of p. mirabilis to all drugs except minocycline were good. against p. aeruginosa in 1993, the activities of aminoglycosides have decreased, but, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. these data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
nosocomial septicemias due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a university hospital over a 12-year period--the same intractable infections.
clinical features of nosocomial bacteremias due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (m group, n = 71) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p group, n = 25) in a university hospital during 1982-1993 were retrospectively analyzed. the majority of these patients had an underlying disease, and bacteremia occurred in hospital. there were no differences in the male to female ratio and the mean age of the patients between the two groups. the ratio of medical wards to surgical wards was higher in the p group (18/7 = 2.6) than for the m group (38/33 = 1.2). p. aeruginosa was more frequently isolated from patients with hematological malignancies and mrsa with solid tumors. the percentage of mrsa among gram-positive bacteremia and of p. aeruginosa among gram-negative bacteria has shown a tendency to increase in recent years, and antibiotic sensitivity of these two organisms showed, on a whole, a tendency to decrease. attention should be called to the increase of these two pathogens.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1994)].
bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 492 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputum of 421 patients with lower respiratory tract infections from october 1994 to september 1995. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 70 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 101 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 92 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 61 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 25 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 48 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 14 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1. s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 51.4%, but the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 56.0%. vancomycin showed the highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. 2. s. pneumoniae. most of the drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem of carbapenems showed the most potent activity with mic80 was 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and clindamycin showed low activities with mic80s > or = 256 micrograms/ml. among these strains, however, 46.5% and 68.3% of strains, were quite sensitive toward these agents, respectively, with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae tested. cefmenoxime a cephem, showed the most potent activity, the mics of this drug against all of the 92 strains were 0.063 microgram/ml. ofloxacin also showed a potent activity, and inhibited about 96% of strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. gentamicin, arbekacin and ciprofloxacin showed next potent activities, and their mic80s were 2 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80 of 2 micrograms/ml. comparing to the activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains), the activities of all the drugs tested were lower against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). 6. k. pneumoniae. carumonam showed the most potent activity against k. pneumoniae with mic80 of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefozopran showed the next most potent activity with mic80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. ampicillin and cephems except cefpodoxime, cefozopran and cefditoren showed low activities and their mic80s were > or = 16 micrograms/ml, and their mics were all higher than > or = 4 micrograms/ml. 7. m. (b.) catarrhalis. imipenem and ofloxacin showed the most potent activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, their mic80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and minocycline showed the next highest activities with their mic80s at 0.25 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, the respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology of bacteria. patients characteristics, in this period of investigation showed varieties of infectious diseases found in patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 62.0% of all the cases. different lower respiratory tract infectious were distributed as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest number of cases with 35.6%, 27.1%, respectively, followed by
in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326 had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone.
the in vitro and in vivo activities of cs-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. the in vitro activity of cs-940 against gram-positive bacteria was nearly equal to or greater than those of the other quinolones tested. in particular, cs-940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the mic at which 90% of the clinical isolates are inhibited. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cs-940 was comparable to or greater than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin. the activity of cs-940 was largely unaffected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of horse serum, but it was decreased under acidic conditions, as was also seen with the other quinolones tested. cs-940 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in oral treatment of mouse systemic infections caused by s. aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa, cs-940 was more effective than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin against all strains tested. against experimental pneumonia with k. pneumoniae in mice, cs-940 was the most effective of all the quinolones tested. these results suggest that cs-940 may be effective in the therapy of various bacterial infections.
5-alkoxyimidazoquinolones as potential antibacterial agents. synthesis and structure-activity relationships.
4-substituted 6-cyclopropyl-6, 9-dihydro-5-methoxy-9-oxo-1h-imidazo[4,5-f] quinoline-8-carboxylic acids (6) and 8-substituted 1,5,6,11-tetrahydro-5-methyl-1-oxo-imidazo[4,5-g]pyrido[1,2,3-de][1,4] benzoxazine-2-carboxylic acids (7) were prepared as potential antibacterial quinolone derivatives. the appendages at c-4 of -6 and at c-8 of -7 were selected from 1-piperazinyl, 4-methylpiperazinyl, 3-aminomethylpyrrolidinyl, and 3-aminomethylpyrrolidinyl groups. the 5-methoxyimidazoquinolones 6 were superior to the corresponding ofloxacin type analogues 7 in in vitro antibacterial activity. the activity of 6 was equipotent against s. aureus, but 2 to 16 times less potent against e. coli and p. aeruginosa compared to that of the 5-fluoro analogue 3.
precipitating pseudomonas aeruginosa antibodies and antimicrobial therapy in cystic fibrosis patients.
forty patients with cystic fibrosis were studied bacteriologically and serologically. precipitating pseudomonas aeruginosa antibodies were monitored by crossed-immunoelectrophoresis (cie) in order to evaluate the possibility of preventing chronic colonization by pseudomonas aeruginosa by cycles of antimicrobial therapy. sputum or pharyngeal aspirate and serum samples from all patients were analyzed by means of spread on selective media and cie, respectively. significant differences in the number of precipitins were obtained: noncolonized and intermittently colonized patients had no precipitins, whereas the number of precipitins in the chronically colonized patients varied from 11 to 44. an increase in the number of precipitins could be a good marker for initiation of therapy with antimicrobial agents that are either active against pseudomonas aeruginosa or able to inhibit the release of virulence factors.
influence of temperature on mutational resistance to 4-quinolones.
minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of ciprofloxacin (cas 85721-33-1),  ofloxacin (cas 82419-36-1) or levofloxacin (cas 100986-85-4) against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were determined at 37, 30 and 25 degrees c on nutrient agar. with e. coli and s. aureus, reducing the incubation temperature from 37 to 30 to 25 degrees c decreased the mic values for each drug. with p. aeruginosa, temperature reduction also decreased the mic values for ciprofloxacin but increased the mics for ofloxacin or levofloxacin. with s. epidermidis, temperature reduction increased the mics for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin but with levofloxacin the mics were identical at 37 or 25 degrees c but higher at 30 degrees c. mutants of these bacterial species were selected on nutrient agar containing five times their respective mics of the 4-quinolones at 37, 30 and 25 degrees c. with s. epidermidis, temperature reduction always reduced its mutation frequency to resist 4-quinolones, whereas with the other three species the effect of temperature was more variable, and in some instances even elevated their mutation rates.
isolation and characterization of a new member of the insect defensin family from a beetle, allomyrina dichotoma.
a new family member of insect defensin, an antibacterial peptide, has been isolated from larvae of a beetle, allomyrina dichotoma. the peptide consisted of 43 amino acids and 6 cystein residues were conserved in the same position as that of other insect defensins. the new defensin was found to be inducible by bacterial injection. analysis of the antibacterial spectrum of a. dichotoma defensin indicated that this peptide showed antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria like staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis but not against gram-negative bacteria like escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating a typical spectrum of the insect defensin family. in addition, a. dichotoma defensin also exhibited antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolated from a patient.
[microbiological study of the respiratory tract in children with cystic fibrosis].
purpose: pulmonary infections is a main cause of morbimortality in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. the objective of this study was to know the flora implicated in respiratory pathology of all mucoviscidotic children attending hospital sant joan de deu of barcelona. methods: quantitative cultures from respiratory samples (most of them: sputum) of 26 patients were performed from january 91 to june 93. there were 13 girls and 13 boys, aged 1 to 13 years (mean: 7 years). results: 282 microorganisms were isolated from 203 positive samples. cultures of 88.4% of patients yielded in some moment haemophilus influenzae, 82.6% of them haemophilus parainfluenzae, 65.3% pseudomonas aeruginosa, 50% streptococcus pneumoniae, 38.4% staphylococcus aureus. the most prevalent microorganism was p. aeruginosa (66%) followed by h. influenzae (29%) and s. aureus (26.6%). 59% of p. aeruginosa strains showed a mucoid phenotype. conclusions: haemophilus sp. causes short term infections that affect children of all ages, whereas infections due to p. aeruginosa persist in spite of correct antimicrobial therapy.
bacterial changes in neonatal intensive care unit.
organisms routinely cultured from throat swabs and infectious agents of sepsis and/or meningitis were reviewed. during the last 12 years, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli have been replaced by staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa as the predominant isolates from throat swabs after admission. these change in the etiologic pattern of infectious agents of sepsis and/or meningitis, i.e., k. pneumoniae, e. coli, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis, were in agreement with the organisms isolated from the throat swabs after admission. the s. aureus isolated from throat swabs after admission showed a decrease in the bacterial activity of cloxacillin, cephazolin and cefotaxime since 1978.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1993)].

[tobramycin--clinical pharmacology and chemotherapy].
aminoglycosides are potent water-soluble antibiotics, with peak concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against many pathogenic aerobic gram-negative bacilli and staphylococcus aureus: they exhibit enduring antibacterial activity many hours after tissue concentrations become negligible and appreciation of this postantibiotic effect is leading to replacement of conventional multiple daily doses by large once-daily doses. cotreatment with betalactams is commonly employed in order to exploit a synergism between these antimicrobial agents, particularly in severe gram-negative sepsis. resistance to aminoglycosides may be observed at several levels and is generally high when due to the acquisition of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes which may be plasmid-borne or transferred by transposable elements. tobramycin is more effective than gentamicin and the other aminoglycosides against pseudomonas aeruginosa and is less nephrotoxic than gentamicin. higher serum tobramycin concentrations at the peak are associated with a longer postantibiotic effect and increased bactericidal activity. a longer dosage interval may decrease the risk of nephrotoxicity because higher transient serum aminoglycoside levels appear to be less nephrotoxic than lower but more persistent serum concentrations. once-daily administration may also reduce the risk of ototoxicity through a similar mechanism. in a multicenter italian study of 104 adult patients with severe bacterial lower respiratory tract infections, the safety and efficacy of a regimen of high dose, once-daily tobramycin alone or in combination with antipseudomonas betalactams was assessed. the overall bacteriological response was an elimination of the original pathogen in 70% of the patients while the clinical response mirrored the bacteriological results with a successful clinical outcome in 78% of patients. adverse experiences were, in general, few and mild without oto- or nephrotoxicity. the once-daily, high dose regimen of tobramycin proved to be a safe and efficacious therapy for severe lower respiratory tract infections in adult patients.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1992)].
bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout japan since 1981, and ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of the isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and the relationships between the isolates and characteristics of the patients and so forth each year. we discuss the results in detail. in 20 institutions around the entire japan from october 1992 to september 1993, 690 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 549 patients with lower respiratory tract infections and presumed to be the etiological bacteria. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 101 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 121 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 122 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 32 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), 52 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 28 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were measured except the strains which died during transportation. 1. s. aureus s. aureus strains for which mics of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 61.4% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria was higher than the previous year's 58.3%. mics values indicated that arbekacin was as active as vancomycin against all the strains on s. aureus. 2. s. pneumoniae benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. cefuzonam, cefazolin, cefotaxime and cefmenoxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity, and mic80 was 0.015 microgram/ml. 3. h. influenzae all the drugs tested were potent against h. influenzae. ampicillin among the penicillins showed mic80 1 microgram/ml against h. influenzae. cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, cefuzonam and cefixime showed the most potent activities, and mic80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. the antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid) ciprofloxacin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), and mic80 was 1 microgram/ml. cefsulodin, aztreonam, carumonam and tobramycin showed the next most potent activities with an mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with an mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. norfloxacin also showed some activity, and mic80 was 4 micrograms/ml. comparing to activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. k. pneumoniae the activities of all drugs except penicillins were high activities against k. pneumoniae. carumonam showed the most potent activity with an mic80 of 0.063 microgram/ml, followed by flomoxef, cefixime and cefozopran with their mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. 7. m.(b.) catarrhalis imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity against m.(b.) catarrhalis with an mic80 0.063 microgram/ml. minocycline and ofloxacin showed mic80s 0.125 microgram/ml, respectively. we also investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, as well as types of respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiological bacteria. as for patients backgrounds, there were many infectious diseases found among patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 60.8% of the diseases. the distribution by lower respiratory tract infections was as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for the greatest numbers of cases with 30.4%, 29.5%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis with 12.2%. as for frequencies of etiologic bacteria for respiratory tract infections, h. influenzae: 22.2%, and s. pneumoniae: 15.1% in chronic bronchitis; s. pneumoniae: 2
biological activities of new poly(n-1-adamantylmaleimide) and poly(n-1-diamantylmaleimide).
n-1-diamantylmaleimide was synthesized by reaction of maleic anhydride with 1-aminodiamantane, followed by dehydration with acetic anhydride and sodium acetate. poly(n-1-adamantylmaleimide) (iia) and poly(n-1-diamantylmaleimide) (iib) were synthesized by free radical polymerization. n-1-adamanlylmaleimide (ia) and n-1-diamantylmaleimide (ib), exhibited strong activities in vitro antitumor activities. interestingly, poly(n-1-adamantylmaleimide) exhibited growth inhibitory values against colo 205, hep g2, and sk-br-3, similar to 5-fluorouracil. it was noted that poly(n-1-adamantylmaleimide) showed relatively lower cytotoxicity against molt-4 cells than against colo 205, hep g2, and sk-br-3 cells. the decreasing antitumor activities against individual tumor cell line were in the order ia > ib > iia > iib. this result shows that n-substituents of maleimides play an important role in their antitumor activity. additionally, ia and ib show good in vitro activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 while polymers iia and iib exhibited weak activity against s. aureus atcc 25923.
characteristics of streptomyces strains isolated from soils in two landfill areas in north jordan.
a total of 114 streptomyces strains were isolated and purified from soils collected from al akider (53) and from al kafeer (61) landfill areas in north jordan. the al akider strains were classified into 5 colour series gray (27), white (18), yellow (3), violet (3) and green (2); while the al kafeer strains were classified into 6 colour series white (26), gray (16), yellow (9), red (2), green (7) and blue (1). melanin pigment was produced by 21 and 25% of the al akider and al kafeer strains, respectively, while soluble pigment was produced by 15% of the a; akider and 21% of the al kafeer strains; 17% of al akider strains and 23% of al kafeer strains showed distinctive reverse side pigment. forty, 32, 19, and 9% of the al akider strains had spiral, rectus, flexous and retinaculum apertum spore-chains, respectively, while the distribution of the al kafeer strains in the same spore-chain forms was equally 25% each. arabinose, xylose, inositol, fructose, rhamnose, sucrose, raffinose, and mannitol were utilized by 91, 53, 89, 60, 30, 25 and 79% of the al akider strains and by 84, 59, 62, 64, 70, 75, 41 and 26% of the al kafeer strains, respectively, while only 2% of the al kafeer strains were found to utilize cellulose. thirty-six percent of the al akider strains showed, in vitro activity against staphylococcus aureus followed by aspergillus niger (26%), bacillus cereus and saccharomyces cerevisiae (25% each), fusarium monilliforme (21%), candida albicans (15%), escherichia coli (8%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), while 51, 49, 46, 34, 25, 15, 7 and 2% of the al kafeer strains exhibited activity against a. niger, s. cerevisiae, b. cereus, s. aureus, f. monilliforme, c. albicans, p. aeruginosa and e. coli, respectively.
in vitro antibacterial properties of t-5575 and t-5578 novel parenteral 2-carboxypenams.
t-5575 and t-5578, novel 2-carboxypenams in which a carboxyl group has been introduced into the c-2 beta position of the nucleus, were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial properties. the spectrum of activity of t-5575 was similar to that of aztreonam. however, it showed stronger activities than those of aztreonam against most gram-negative bacteria. t-5575 also showed potent activities against isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime, with mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited of 0.39, 0.39, and 3.13 microgram/ml, respectively. t-5578 showed moderate levels of activity against gram-negative bacteria, compared with those of t-5575. its activity against p. aeruginosa, however, was superior to those of t-5575 and the reference drugs tested. the most characteristic feature of t-5578 was its potent activities against ceftazidime-, imipenem-, and gentamicin-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates, with mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited at 0.39, 3.13, and 3.13 microgram/ml, respectively. these two compounds were unfortunately poorly active against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococci. both compounds were found to be stable for hydrolysis by various kinds of beta-lactamases and to have low affinities for these enzymes, with ki values of > 100 microm. these novel penams bound most tightly to penicillin-binding protein 3 of escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results indicate that t-5575 and t-5578 can be regarded as promising 2-carboxypenams specially targeted against gram-negative pathogens.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
susceptibilities of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 hospitals during june 1993 to may 1994 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated utis, complicated utis without indwelling catheter, and complicated utis with indwelling catheter. the susceptibilities of e. faecalis to chloramphenicol decreased. as for s. aureus, susceptible strains to minocycline (mino) decreased in complicated utis. as for citrobacter spp., and enterobacter spp., their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. against e. coli, the activities of cefotiam decreased in complicated utis, and aminoglycosides decreased. as for klebsiella spp., susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. the susceptibilities of p. mirabilis to all drugs except aminoglycosides and mino were good. the susceptibilities of p. aeruginosa to quinolones isolated from complicated utis with indwelling catheter increased, but susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. the susceptibilities of serratia spp. to mino has decreased. these data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
neutrophil-derived long-lived oxidants in cystic fibrosis sputum.
we evaluated long-lived oxidant potential in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) by quantitating the methionine-inhibitable, long-lived oxidant fraction of sputum, referred to as the chloramines. taurine, the preferred amino acid substrate for chloramine formation, and myeloperoxidase (mpo), the chlorinated oxidant-generating enzyme, were also quantitated. as compared with the sputum of asthmatic subjects, the sputum of cf patients contained high concentrations of chloramines along with high levels of taurine and active mpo. a negative correlation between chloramine and taurine was found in the sputum of cf patients. no correlation was found between the density of pseudomonas aeruginosa and the level of chloramines, taurine, or mpo. in contrast, respiratory parameters (%fev or %fvc) and a nutritional index correlated positively with chloramine levels, whereas negative correlations were observed with taurine and mpo. in addition, the effect of antibiotic therapy, which significantly increased chloramine and decreased taurine levels, supported a beneficial effect of chloramines on overall clinical status. our findings support a dual role of long-lived oxidants at the site of airway inflammation in cf, one component of which is their ability to mediate oxidative stress and the other a beneficial effect that may be partly explained by their inhibitory effect on antiprotease defense systems.
anti-microbial activity and anti-complement activity of extracts obtained from selected hawaiian medicinal plants.
selected plants having a history of use in polynesian traditional medicine for the treatment of infectious disease were investigated for anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activity in vitro. extracts from scaevola sericea, psychotria hawaiiensis, pipturus albidus and eugenia malaccensis showed selective anti-viral activity against herpes simplex virus-1 and 2 and vesicular stomatitis virus. aleurites moluccana extracts showed anti-bacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, while pipturus albidus and eugenia malaccensis extracts showed growth inhibition of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. psychotria hawaiiensis and solanum niger inhibited growth of the fungi microsporum canis, trichophyton rubrum and epidermophyton floccosum, while ipomoea sp., pipturus albidus, scaevola sericea, eugenia malaccensis, piper methysticum, barringtonia asiatica and adansonia digitata extracts showed anti-fungal activity to a lesser extent. eugenia malaccensis was also found to inhibit the classical pathway of complement suggesting that an immunological basis for its in vivo activity was identified. this study has confirmed some of the ethnobotanical reports of hawaiian medicinal plants having curative properties against infections using biological assays in vitro.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1992). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
susceptibilities of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 11 hospitals during june 1992 to may 1993 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated utis, complicated utis without indwelling catheter, and complicated utis with indwelling catheter. the susceptibilities of e. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated utis to quinolones has decreased. as for s. aureus, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., p. mirabilis and serratia spp., which were detected very few in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. e. coli, all strains were highly susceptibilities to latamoxef and cefozopran. and the susceptibilities of e. coli isolated from uncomplicated utis and complicated utis without indwelling catheter to minocycline has decreased in 1991, but they has been indicated a trend of recovery in 1992. the difference in according uti's classification of the susceptibilities of klebsiella spp. to minocycline in 1991 has not recognized in 1992. and the susceptibilities of klebsiella spp. isolated from complicated utis without indwelling catheter to quinolones has decreased. the susceptibilities of p. aeruginosa isolated from complicated utis to quinolones has been indicated a trend of recovery. these data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
antibacterial activity of cefprozil in vitro.
cefprozil is a new orally active cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against 637 recent clinical isolates from the kaohsiung veterans general hospital, taiwan. against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, cefprozil showed good activity, inhibiting over 80% of these isolates at 8 mg/l. like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. against haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, cefprozil showed high activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas against methicillin-resistant s. aureus, its activity was higher than that of other oral cephalosporins tested and was similar to that of ciprofloxacin. of enterococci tested, 57.7% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefprozil. against beta-hemolytic streptococci, its activity was superior to all other drugs tested. the results of this in vitro study indicate that oral administration of cefprozil might be efficacious in the treatment of community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
[antimicrobial activity and interaction with dna of medicinal plants from the peruvian amazon region].
decoctions of four plants used for the treatment of different infections by indigenous groups of the peruvian amazon, i.e. abuta grandifolia, cyperus articulatus, gnaphalium spicatum and pothomorphe peltata were evaluated for antimicrobial activity by the "stroke method" in agar plates. tested organisms included staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella gallinarum, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium gordonae. all decoctions showed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the tested organisms. the a. grandifolia and c. articulatis decoctions partially inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa. s. aureus was completely inhibited by c. articulatus decoction and only partially inhibited by g. spicatum and p. peltata. the a. grandifolia decoction also showed a partial inhibition against m. gordonae, showing a clear correlation between the ethnopharmacological use and the observed activity. methanolic extracts of plants were analyzed by using the dna-methyl green bioassay. the methanolic extract of p. peltata (concentration 1000 micrograms/ml) showed a decrease of 30% regarding to the initial absorbance of the dna-mg complex suggesting the possible interaction with dna.
etiology and therapy of chronic suppurative otitis.
infectious diseases of the ear are important in adults due to their incidence and relapses. we carried out a study of aerobic microorganisms on 251 otic exudates from patients diagnosed as having chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma (119), chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma (85) and chronic external otitis (47). the microorganisms predominantly isolated were, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and other enterobacteriaceae. 86% of isolates were monomicrobial and 14% of isolates were polymicrobial. in these latter the predominantly isolated microorganisms were also p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, corynebacterium spp. and proteus mirabilis. p. aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated and showed the highest percentages of resistance against antimicrobial agents tested. p. aeruginosa was most susceptible to ciprofloxacin and imipenem, but much less susceptible to cefotaxime, moxalactam and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. s. aureus was highly sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin and teichoplanin. 100% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin g and ampicillin.
emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100% to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.

isolated bacteria from respiratory tract infections were collected since 1981 in  cooperation with institutions located throughout japan, and have been investigated for their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and reported by ikemoto, et al. relationships between these isolates and backgrounds of the patients were also studied each year. these results are discussed in detail in this report. in 20 institutions around the entire japan from october 1991 to september 1992, 631 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 529 patients with respiratory tract infections and tentatively determined to be etiological agents. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics against 96 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 112 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 111 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 114 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 41 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 39 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), klebsiella pneumoniae and some others, were determined, and the drug sensitivities of these strains were determined except for the strains that had been killed during transportation: 1. s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 58.3% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria increased over previous year's 42.5%. as shown by the mics, arbekacin was active as vancomycin against all the strains on s. aureus. 2. s. pneumoniae: benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed a potent activity against s. pneumoniae. cefuzonam, cefmenoxime, cefozopran and cefotaxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem; a penem antibiotic, showed the most potent activity with mic80 of 0.03 micrograms/ml. 3. h. influenzae: activities of all drugs were excellent against h. influenzae strains tested. ampicillin showed mic80 of 1 micrograms/ml against h. influenzae. cefuzonam showed the most potent activity among cephems, it completely killed all bacteria at mic 0.06 micrograms/ml. cefotaxime and cefmenoxime showed next most potent activities with mic80s of 0.06 micrograms/ml. the antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid). ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), and their mic80s were 4 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid): similarly, ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with mic80 of 2 micrograms/ml. comparing to activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. k. pneumoniae: the activities of all drugs except for penicillins were very high against k. pneumoniae.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1990)].
these investigations have been continued since 1981. in this year the isolation frequencies and sensitivities to antibiotics were investigated for 654 bacterial strains isolated from respiratory tract infections in 20 institutions during the period of october 1990 to september 1991. among staphylococcus aureus isolated from inpatients, many were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and the frequency of their isolation was 56.3% for inpatients and 4.3% for outpatients. of the relation to antibiotic administration, the isolation frequency of mrsa before administration of antibiotics was 19.6% (10/51), and after administration was 75.0% (27/36). the sensitivities of s. aureus to imipenem and clindamycin (mic80) decreased from 0.2 microgram/ml to 64 micrograms/ml and from 0.2 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml, respectively. we investigated year to year changes in the backgrounds of patients with respiratory tract infections. bacterial pneumonia was 31.6% among respiratory tract infections in the period of the study, this trend has increase from 1989. frequencies of different etiological bacteria in respiratory tract infections did not change appreciably from year to year, and s. aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most showing some frequent pathogens.
[annual number of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated inpatients, and antibacterial activity of various antibiotics against p. aeruginosa isolated from clinical specimens of inpatients].
in recent years, isolation rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has decreased, while the rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa has increased. this phenomenon may be a result of regulation of use of antibiotics which belongs to the third cephems and extensive preventive measures against hospital acquired infections due to mrsa. based on our investigation in which we determined mics of various antibiotics against p. aeruginosa strains isolated from inpatients, the antibacterial activities of cefclidin (cfcl) was superior to those of other antibiotics. the antibacterial activity of cfcl against p. aeruginosa tested was similar to or stronger than that of tobramycin.
[effectiveness of antibacterial clothes and wall material against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa].
to evaluate the antibacterial activities of antibacterial clothes and wall material, we measured the reduction rates of mrsa and p. aeruginosa using four products of antibacterial clothes and one wall material. antibacterial activities are judged by the reduction rates of bacteria after 18 hours incubation at 35.0 degrees c. in the 50 strains of mrsa tested, two of four brands of clothes showed over 99% reduction rates, while only one brand showed a reduction rates over 99% in the 13 strains of p. aeruginosa. the wall material tested showed a reduction rates over 99% for the 50 strains of mrsa and over 90% for the 50 strains of p. aeruginosa. these data indicate that usage of some products of antibacterial clothes and wall material in the hospital may be useful the prevention of nosocomial infection.
antimicrobial activity of glycerine-ichthammol in otitis externa.
the clinical efficacy of glycerine-ichthammol in otitis externa may be due to an  anti-inflammatory action of ichthammol or a dehydrating effect of glycerine on the oedematous ear canal. its antimicrobial activity, if any, against the common organisms in otitis externa is not well known. a study of the antibacterial property of glycerine-ichthammol as measured by a growth inhibition test and a modified cidal assay, showed inhibition of selected gram positive organisms (streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus) by ichthammol and glycerine-ichthammol combination, but only negligible antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. candida albicans was also weakly inhibited. as the activity against gram negative organisms is minimal, incorporation of an anti-gram negative antibiotic such as gentamicin in the glycerine-ichthammol compound to enhance its antibacterial spectrum is suggested.
synthesis of 1,2,5(6)-trisubstituted benzimidazoles and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
a series of 22 benzimidazoles, having several substituents on the azole and benzene nuclei, were prepared and evaluated in vitro for antimicrobial activity. at first 2-chloro or 2-chloromethyl-5(6)-substituted-1h-benzimidazoles were synthesized, which were then substituted at c-2 with several piperazine or piperidine derivatives. the antibacterial activity of these compounds against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the antifungal activity against candida albicans, candida stellatoidea, candida parapsilosis, and candida pseudotropicalis were determined as the mic values. since compound 12 exhibits good activity, in order to clarify the effect of substituents at c-1 on the activity, benzimidazole derivatives having ethyl, allyl, benzyl, and p-fluorobenzyl substituents at c-1 were prepared, and slightly increased activity was seen.
in vitro evaluation of abt-719, a novel dna gyrase inhibitor.
abt-719 (a-86719.1) is the first compound of a new class of novel dna gyrase inhibitors, the 2-pyridones, with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. abt-719 was more active than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and clinafloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. abt-719 was particularly active against staphylococcus aureus (mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited [mic90] = 0.015 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 0.03 micrograms/ml). abt-719 was also the most active of the compounds tested against ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus isolates, with an mic90 of 0.25 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. against gram-negative organisms, abt-719 was as active as or slightly more active than ciprofloxacin and was the most active compound against ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 = 2.0 micrograms/ml). abt-719 was also the most active compound against both gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml.
antimicrobial activity of sm-17466, a novel carbapenem antibiotic with potent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-17466, a new 1 beta-methyl carbapenem, were evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isoaltes and compared with the activities of meropenem, imipenem, vancomycin, and arbekacin. sm-17466 had a broad spectrum of action against gram-positive bacteria, showing especially potent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. the mics of sm-17466, meropenem, imipenem, vancomycin, and arbekacin at which 90% of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were inhibited were 3.13, 50, 100, 1.56, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. this activity of sm-17466 was almost equivalent to those of the antibiotics used for the treatment of infections caused by this organism. sm-17466 also showed bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. in contrast, sm-17466 was less active against gram-negative bacteria, especially against pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared with the other carbapenems; however, of the carbapenems, sm-17466 exhibited the highest activity against haemophilus influenzae and bacteriodes fragilis. sm-17466, at a 50% inhibitory concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml, bound to penicillin-binding proteins 1 to 4 in methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and also had good binding to penicillin-binding protein 2' in a methicillin-resistant strain (50% inhibitory concentration, 5.9 micrograms/ml). this high affinity, which was 10 and 20 times greater than those for meropenem and imipenem, respectively, was reflected in the potent activity of sm-17466 against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. sm-17466 demonstrated excellent in vivo efficacy against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. aureus strains in a mouse peritoneal infection model: the efficacy of sm-17466 against methicillin-resistant strains was equal to or one-third that of vancomycin. this activity was comparable to the in vitro activity of sm-17466. the subcutaneous injection of sm-17466 in mice revealed that the half-life of sm-17466 in serum was about 18 min, intermediate between those of vancomycin and arbekacin and 1.5-fold that of imipenem-cilastatin. sm-17466 was resistant to hydrolysis by swine renal dehydropeptidase i, to an extent comparable to the resistance shown by meropenem.
[decrease of nosocomial bacteremia and nosocomial pneumonia after introduction of preventive measures of hospital infection].
in the early 1980's methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was reported as a major pathogenic organism of geriatric hospital infection in japan. at the same time in the a geriatric hospital mrsa infection was prevalent. to decrease nosocomial infections some active preventive measures against hospital infection were taken since oct. 1991. about a year before introduction of prevention of hospital infection in the geriatric ward (190 beds) of a hospital 193 episodes of nosocomial bacteremia were observed. however a year after introduction of preventive measures episodes of nosocomial bacteremia were decreased to less than a half (45.6%) in comparison to the number before introduction of prevention. as a causative organism gram-positive bacteria including mrsa were markedly decreased. major portals of entry of bacteremia (74.9%) were urinary-tract system, intravenous hyperalimentation (ivh) catheter, and pressure sores. mrsa-positive pressure sores were decreased to 20.4% of those before prevention. on the other hand 87 episodes of nosocomial pneumonia were observed before prevention. however a year after introduction of preventive measures episodes of nosocomial pneumonia were decreased to less than a half (44.8%) in comparison to the number before introduction of prevention. after prevention mrsa and mixed infection of p. aeruginosa and mrsa were markedly decreased. the decrease of bacteremia and nosocomial pneumonia were caused by cleaning hands, the preventive measures for decrease and improvement of pressure sores, cleaning the upper respiratory tract for prevention of lower respiratory-tract infection cleaning floors and education of the staff, etc.
antibiotic susceptibility of the sputum pathogens and throat swab pathogens isolated from the patients undergoing treatment in twenty-one private clinics in japan.
bacteriology of the respiratory isolates from 2,539 patients with respiratory infections in 21 primary care clinics was documented. of a total of 1,887 strains of potential pathogens recovered from 1,507 patients, 996 were gram-positive and 891 were gram-negative. major pathogens were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. the mic's against microbial isolates of six antimicrobial agents were determined. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against s. aureus, moraxella catarrhalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin and cefteram were more active against s. pnuemoniae and s. pyogenes than four other antimicrobials tested, respectively, in this experiment. new quinolones and new generation cephems were active against h. influenzae and enterobacteriaceae. only one strain of s. aureus was methicillin-resistant. as regards other pathogens, 6.5% of s. pneumoniae and 14.9% of h. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin, and 26.7% of h. influenzae were beta-lactamase-positive. mrsa was found infrequently. but ampicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae were found in primary care clinics almost as frequently as in intensive-medication-oriented clinics.
screening of hundred rwandese medicinal plants for antimicrobial and antiviral properties.
a series of 100 rwandese medicinal plants (267 plant extracts), used by traditional healers to treat infections, were screened for antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties. the results of the testing showed that 45% were active against staphylococcus aureus, 2% against escherichia coli, 16% against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7% against candida albicans, 80% against microsporum canis and 60% against trichophyton mentagrophytes. not less than 27% of the plant species exhibited prominent antiviral properties against one or more test viruses, more specifically 12% against poliomyelitis, 16% against coxsackie, 3% against semliki forest, 2% against measles and 8% against herpes simplex virus.
rapid identification of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa using gas chromatography-electron-capture mass spectrometry.
the 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines and their n-oxides are secondary metabolites produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa which inhibit the growth of a number of gram-positive organisms including staphylococcus aureus. to facilitate the identification of these compounds in biological fluids, we have developed a rapid profiling system based on gas chromatography-electron-capture mass spectrometry of the o-bistrifluoromethylbenzoyl derivatives. using the technique, over twenty hydroxyalkylquinolines have been identified from a culture obtained from a strain of p. aeruginosa obtained from a patient with severe bronchiectasis.
e-4695, a new c-7 azetidinyl fluoronaphthyridine with enhanced activity against gram-positive and anaerobic pathogens.
e-4695, (-)-7-[3-(r)-amino-2-(s)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-1-cyclopropyl-1,4- dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, is a new fluorinated naphthyridine with an azetidine moiety. the mics of e-4695 at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90s) were 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for gram-positive cocci, including species of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and the mic90s against gram-negative pathogens such as members of the family enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of providencia spp. [mic90, 8 micrograms/ml]) and pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml. e-4695 inhibited 90% of the clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis isolates at 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. against gram-positive cocci the potency of e-4695 was 2- to 8-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin, 4- to 8-fold higher than that of ofloxacin, and 8- to 16-fold higher than that of fleroxacin. against enteric bacteria and p. aeruginosa the potency of e-4695 was, in general, similar to that of ciprofloxacin and eightfold higher than those of ofloxacin and fleroxacin. e-4695 was four- and eightfold more potent than ciprofloxacin against c. perfringens and b. fragilis isolates, respectively. e-4695 and ciprofloxacin showed similar properties when the effects of ph or magnesium concentration were tested on them. e-4695 and ciprofloxacin had substantial reductions of activity only when ph decreased below 4.8. e-4695 and ciprofloxacin activities were not markedly affected by the presence of 5 or 10 mm mg2+. the presence of serum and human urine at ph 7.2 decreased the activity of e-4695 between two- and fourfold. after an oral dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum level in serum, the biological half-life, and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 10 h for e-4695 were 13.2 microgram/ml, 3.3 h, and 45.6 microgram . h/ml, respectively. the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 h for ciprofloxacin was 2.3 microgram . h/ml at the same dose. fifty-percent effective doses (ed50s) against staphylococcus aureus hs-93 infections in mice were 4.5 mg/kg with e-4695 and 37.6 mg/kg with ciprofloxacin. infection with streptococcus pneumoniae 29206 was more effectively treated with e-4695 (ed50, 41,2 mg/kg) than with ciprofloxacin (ed50, 200 mg/kg). the ed50 of e-4695 for infections with streptococcus pneumoniae 1625 was 132.2 mg/kg; ciprofloxacin was ineffective at 400 mg/kg against this strain. e-4695 was also more potent than ciprofloxacin in treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms such as escherichia coli hm-42 (ed50s, 1.0 and 3.9 mg/kg, respectively). the ed50s of e-4695 and ciprofloxacin were 33.0 and 145.5 mg/kg against p. aeruginosa hs-116 and 9.6 and 18.9 mg/kg against p. aeruginosa b-120, respectively. the therapeutic efficacy of e-4695 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its improved pharmacokinetic properties.
influence of pulmonary surfactant on in vitro bactericidal activities of amoxicillin, ceftazidime, and tobramycin.
the influence of a natural pulmonary surfactant on antibiotic activity was investigated to assess the possible use of exogenous surfactant as a vehicle for antibiotic delivery to the lung. the influence of surfactant on the bactericidal activity of amoxicillin was tested against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, and the influence of surfactant on the activities of ceftazidime and tobramycin was tested against klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. pneumoniae. in vitro antibiotic activity was determined by killing curve studies in media with and without surfactant. amoxicillin and ceftazidime activities were not changed in the presence of surfactant, except for a decreased killing rate of s. pneumoniae by ceftazidime in medium with additional rabbit serum. in contrast, killing curves with low concentrations of tobramycin (0.25x and 1x the mic) showed a decreased level of activity of tobramycin against all pathogens tested in the presence of surfactant. with higher tobramycin concentrations (4x the mic) killing rates were decreased less or were unchanged in the presence of surfactant. concluding from the results of the study, both amoxicillin and ceftazidime can be combined with surfactant without the loss of activity. for mixing surfactant with tobramycin, dosages should be adjusted to overcome the partial inactivation of tobramycin by surfactant.
microbial counts and characteristics of streptoverticillium strains isolated from soils in the jordan valley.
a microbial survey of total bacterial count, agrobacteria, streptomycetes, and fungi was carried out in six locations in the jordan valley. the highest microbial counts for the four populations were in spring, the lowest mostly in autumn. no significant differences at p < 0.05 were observed either in the counts between the six locations, or in the seasonal counts of agrobacteria and streptomycetes between the six locations as well as within each location. the total bacterial counts (at p < 0.01) and fungi (at p < 0.05) differed significantly in the six locations. microbial counts and the studied environmental conditions showed no significant regression. of 552 streptomycetes strains isolated from soils collected from these locations, 58 belonged to the genus streptoverticillium. they were distributed in five colour series grey (41%), red (31%), green (17%), blue (7%) and white (3%). forty-eight strains had biverticillium spore bearing hyphae while only 10 had monoverticillium. while 28 strains produced distinctive reverse side pigment, only 8 and 6 strains produced soluble pigment and melanin pigment, respectively. most strains utilized arabinose followed by fructose, mannitol, rhamnose, xylose, sucrose, inositol, and raffinose. sixty-nine per cent of the strains exhibited activity in vitro test against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 45, 41, 28, and 7% against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, agrobacterium tumefaciens and escherichia coli, respectively.
mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones: state-of-the-art 1992-1994.
this paper gives an update on the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones. the laboratory techniques currently used to determine the mechanism(s) of resistance are outlined, including the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism and single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis of mutations in gyra. alterations in gyra have continued to be the most reported cause of resistance, with high level resistance due to 2 or more mutations in this gene. recently, mutations in gyra of mycobacterium tuberculosis and campylobacter jejuni have been described. complementation studies with plasmid encoded cloned gyrb from escherichia coli suggest that high fluoroquinolone resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration = 32 mg/l) in salmonella typhimurium can be due to mutation in both gyra and gyrb. decreased fluoroquinolone accumulation into e. coli has been shown to be due to mutations in a number of genes at different loci. current interest has focused upon the marrab and soxrs loci, with mutations in genes of either loci giving rise to decreased susceptibility to several unrelated drugs, including fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and some beta-lactams, and decreased expression of ompf. the genetic characterisation of fluoroquinolone efflux from staphylococcus aureus has shown that efflux occurs in both fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant bacteria. the most likely cause of resistance is overexpression of nora, giving rise to increased efflux. recently, 2 efflux systems in pseudomonas aeruginosa have been proposed, mexa-mexb-oprk and mexc-mexd-oprm, conferring decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and some beta-lactams.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
[protective effect and antibody titer of intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) against clinical isolates of opportunistic bacteria].
neonates and leukopenic, immunosuppressed patients are at high risk for severe infection of opportunistic pathogens despite of the availability of potent antimicrobial agents. in this study, antibody titers of immunoglobulin preparations (ivig) were contrasted with the protective effect in mice against each of bacterial infection. antibody titers were determined by elisa. the antigens were 70-80 clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. antibody titers of ivig against these three gram-negative bacteria ranged 3200 to 102,400. icr mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with each of several strains against which ivig showed various titers. ivig showed rather high protective activities against well-reactive strains, while it showed little protective activities against poor-reactive strains. in the case of p. aeruginosa, statistical analysis of the results obtained with the antibody titer and efficacy showed a good correlation (p < 0.01). on the other hand, ivig showed a high and complicate antibody titer against s. aureus ivig ranging 400,000 to 12,800,000, since apparent titers contained non-specific binding of fc portion of igg with protein a on the cell wall. ivig was active in mice, where protein a was less and specific binding was stronger. bacterial cells have various components; lipopolysaccharide, lipid a, capsule, flagella, pill, etc. that are responsive to specific antibodies. this study indicates that ivig have such antibodies and that is associated with protective activity against bacterial infection in proportion to antibody titer.
in vitro activity of sce-2787, a new cephalosporin with potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
the in vitro activity of sce-2787, 7-[(z)-2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3- yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(1-imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium)methy l-3- cephem-4-carboxylate, was compared with those of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and imipenem against recent clinical isolates. sce-2787 inhibited 50% of tested isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae at < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. sce-2787 was equally active as or more active than ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against members of the enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of proteus vulgaris. the mic of sce-2787 at which 90% of the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited was 2 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold lower than those of imipenem and ceftazidime, respectively. sce-2787, like ceftazidime and imipenem, did not inhibit the majority of strains of pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia. sce-2787 inhibited beta-hemolytic streptococci at < or = 0.12 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, or the anaerobic species tested. methicillin-resistant staphylococci required sce-2787 mics of > or = 16 micrograms/ml, whereas methicillin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. no difference between the mics and mbcs was noted, except for p. aeruginosa, for which there was a fourfold difference. sce-2787 was active over a ph range of 6 to 8. the inoculum size of 10(5) to 10(7) cfu caused only a twofold change in the mic for escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus but a 4- to 16-fold change in enterobacter cloacae and p. aeruginosa. beta-lactamases from bush groups 1, 2a, and 2b did not hydrolyze sce-2787. there was significant hydrolysis of sce-2787 by the beta-lactamases designated 2b', i.e., tem-3, tem-5, tem-7, and tem-9, and by the group 2d beta-lactamases. sce-2787 had poor affinity for group 1 and group 2b enzymes and constitutively produced chromosomal beta-lactamases such as p-99 of enterobacter cloacae and plasmid-mediated tem-1 of e. coli. sce-2787 has in vitro activity comparable to that of current parenteral cephalosporin and is more active against p. aeruginosa and s. aureus.
in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone cp-99,219.
the in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone cp-99,219 [7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl)naphthyridone] was compared with those of four other quinolones against 541 gram-negative, 283 gram-positive, and 70 anaerobic bacterial isolates. cp-99,219 inhibited 90% of many isolates in the family enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml (range, < 0.008 to 1 microgram/ml), an activity comparable to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin and two times greater than that of temafloxacin. ninety percent of the proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 micrograms of cp-99,219 per ml. cp-99,219 inhibited 90% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae isolates at 1 and 0.015 micrograms/ml, respectively. the compound inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus at 0.06 micrograms/ml, whereas a ciprofloxacin concentration of 1 microgram/ml was required to inhibit these organisms. cp-99,219 inhibited 90% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates at a concentration of < or = 4 micrograms/ml, while ciprofloxacin and temafloxacin had mics against these isolates of > 16 micrograms/ml. streptococci were inhibited by < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml, an activity comparable to that of tosufloxacin. cp-99,219 was eight times more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae. bacteroides species were inhibited by cp-99,219 at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml, whereas inhibition of these species required 4- and 16-microgram/ml concentrations of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. the mbcs of cp-99,219 ranged from two to four times the mics, and inoculum size had a minimal effect on mic. cp-99,219 was active against p. aeruginosa at ph 5.5, with only a fourfold increase in mic compared with values obtained at ph 7.5. the addition of up to 9 mm mg(2+) increased the mic range from 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml to 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml. in view of its excellent in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, cp-99,219 merits further study to determine it's clinical pharmacologic properties and potential for therapeutic use.
[pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefozopran in the pediatric field].
cefozopran (czop, sce-2787), a newly developed parenteral cephem antibiotic, was  administered to children with bacterial infections. we determined its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety in these patients. 1. antibacterial activity mics of cefmetazole, ceftazidime, cefuzonam, flomoxef and czop were determined against a total of 19 strains. for gram-positive cocci, mics of czop ranged from 0.39 to 0.78 microgram/ml against staphylococcus aureus (3 strains), from 0.05 to 6.25 micrograms/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae (5 strains), and 12.5 micrograms/ml against enterococcus faecalis (1 strain). these mics were generally similar to those of other cephems, but the mic of czop against e. faecalis was lower than those of the other cephems examined. for gram-negative bacilli, mics of czop were 25 micrograms/ml against citrobacter freundii (1 strain), and 6.25 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 strain). these values were similar to or lower than those of other cephems, mics of czop against haemophilus influenzae (7 strains) ranged from 0.1 to 0.39 microgram/ml. however, the mic of czop against serratia marcescens (1 strain) was higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and czop was as ineffective as the other cephems against this organism. 2. pharmacokinetics czop was administered to children at 20 or 40 mg/kg via intravenous injection, and determinations were made for its serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) using the bioassay. serum concentrations at 30 minutes after administration were 60.4 micrograms/ml with a dose of 20 mg/kg to one patient and 93.9 and 99.0 micrograms/ml with 40 mg/kg to two patients. the corresponding half-lives were 1.55 hours for 20 mg/kg administration, and 1.10 and 3.41 hours for 40 mg/kg, while the aucs were 136.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 20 mg/kg, and 194.4 and 264.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 40 mg/kg. the rates of urinary recovery in the first 8 hours after administration were 45.0% in the patient receiving 20 mg/kg, and 84.6 and 97.6% in the two patients receiving 40 mg/kg. the concentrations in the csf determined in 3 patients with purulent meningitis ranged from 2.6 to 16.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after administration, and the csf/serum concentration ratio ranged from 6.5 to 39.0%. these values for pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the bioassay were similar to those obtained using hplc. 3. clinical evaluation forty-eight patients were clinically evaluated. of these patients, 75% were less than 3 years of age and there were slightly more male children than female children.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
the in-vitro activity of fk-037, a new broad spectrum injectable cephalosporin.
the in-vitro activity of the parenteral cephem fk-037 was compared to those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxycillin and co-amoxiclav. against the enterobacteriaceae fk-037 was generally > or = 16-fold more active than cefuroxime and two- to four-fold more active than ceftazidime and similar in activity to cefpirome. pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed similar susceptibilities to ceftazidime and fk-037 (mic90 4 and 8 mg/l respectively). methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by < or = 4 mg/l of fk-037. the mic of fk-037 for 90% of streptococcus pneumoniae was 0.5 mg/l. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were inhibited by < or = 2 mg/l fk-037.
evaluation of opc-17116 against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract  infections.
the antibacterial activity of opc-17116, a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. the pharmacokinetic profiles of opc-17116 were studied in both mice and rats given the drug orally at doses of 50 and 40 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. opc-17116 showed a high degree of distribution in the lung tissues of both species, with maximum concentrations of 29.6 and 32.0 micrograms/g, respectively. furthermore, the drug concentrations in lung tissue were about 10 to 15 times greater than the concentrations in plasma. opc-17116 showed potent antibacterial activity against such pathogens as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. the mics of this compound for 90% of these organisms except methicillin-resistant s. aureus and p. aeruginosa ranged from < or = 0.006 to 0.78 microgram/ml. the in vitro antibacterial activity of opc-17116 was reflected by the efficacy of a single oral dose against systemic bacterial infections in mice. opc-17116 showed a superior effect against gram-positive bacteria, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis. in comparison with the other reference compounds, the efficacy of opc-17116 was less than that of ciprofloxacin against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa. opc-17116 showed a greater therapeutic effect than the other drugs against experimental acute pneumonia caused by these organisms in mice or rats. this excellent therapeutic effect against respiratory tract infections may be a result of its high level of distribution in lung tissue.
[a study on mrsa infections and replacement of bacteria. efficacy of vancomycin-ceftazidime combination therapy].
we analyzed the results of bacteriological tests on patients with masa infections admitted to osaka prefectural hospital, for the past 10 years. the conclusions obtained are as follows. 1. in our hospital, mrsa infections accounted for 50% or more of all staphylococcus aureus infections in 1983 and 1984 (in the first half of the 1980's), markedly decreased to about 10% after 1988, because of the preventive measures taken against nosocomial infections and initiation of anti-mrsa treatment. during the latter period, use of antibiotics including third generation cephems was not especially restricted. 2. glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods (gnf-gnr) or yeasts co-isolated with s. aureus were more frequent in mrsa infected patients, than those in mssa infected patients. 70 to 80% of gnf-gnr were p. aeruginosa. 3. sensitivities of mrsa to drugs were studied. vcm was most active, followed by arbekacin and rifampicin. effectiveness against co-isolated gnf-gnr was high with ofloxacin, netilmicin and ceftazidime (caz). therefore, is expected that, to prevent the replacement of opportunistic infections, combination therapies using vancomycin and caz would be effective.
cefquinome (hr 111v). in vitro evaluation of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin indicated for infections in animals.
cefquinome (formerly hr 111v), an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with cefepime, cefpirome, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime against 681 clinical cultures and a challenge set of bacteria with well-characterized resistance mechanisms. cefquinome minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90) for the enterobacteriaceae ranged from < or = 0.12-2 micrograms/ml with the highest mic (4 micrograms/ml) obtained among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and providencia stuartii strains. a total of 90% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefquinome at < or = 8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome activity of particular note for gram-positive isolates included corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and enterococci (mic50, 4-8 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was 32-fold less susceptible (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) to cefquinome than oxacillin-susceptible (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) strains. cefquinome was very potent against fastidious isolates such as moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml); haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.06-1 micrograms/ml), neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.06-0.5 micrograms/ml), and streptococcus species (mic90, < or = 0.03-006 micrograms/ml). when tested against organisms possessing bush group 2 enzymes (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), cefquinome remained active (mic, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) against the majority of strains. this compound should be very active against pathogens generally found in animal infections and possesses a potency and spectrum comparable to the "fourth-generation" cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome) being investigated for human infectious diseases.
effect of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc(ii) metal ions on the biological activity of triazine derived ligand.
a new schiff-base triazine-derived ligand and its cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) metal complexes have been synthesised and characterised on the basis of elemental analysis, molar conductance, infrared, hnmr and electronic spectral, and magnetic susceptibility data. in order to asssess the effect of metal ions on the antibacterial activity, the ligand and its complexes have been screened against bacterial species escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. in all cases the activity/potency has substantially increased on complexation against one or more bacterial species.
in-vitro activity of four new fluoroquinolones.
the in-vitro activities of four new fluoroquinolones, e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and  e-4904, were compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 1106 clinical isolates. against majority of enterobacteriaceae, general antibacterial activities of e-4749 (mic90s 0.06-1 mg/l), e-4874 (mic90s, 0.03-0.25 mg/l) and e-4884 (mic90s 0.01-0.5 mg/l) were comparable or slightly lower than those of ciproloxacin (mic90s 0.01-0.25 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90s 0.01-1 mg/l). the activity of e-4904 (mic90s 0.06-2 mg/l) was lower than those of its analogues. most of the escherichia coli which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) and serratia spp., were resistant to the new fluoroquinolones. beta-lactamase producing strains of moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible to these compounds (mics < or = 0.008 mg/l). most of pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-aeruginosa pseudomonas spp., xanthomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter spp. were resistant to the new quinolones (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l). on the contrary, these new antimicrobials were active against the majority of the aeromonas spp. (mic90s < or = 0.5 mg/l). e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and e-4904 remained active (mic90s < or = 0.25 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus strains susceptible to methicillin. however, its activity was two- to eight-fold lower than that of ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.03 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90 0.06 mg/l). against s. aureus resistant to methicillin or ciprofloxacin, activity of these new compounds and comparators agents, was very low (mic90s 2- > 16 mg/l). most of the strains of enterococcus faecalis were resistant (mic90s > 16 mg/l). the activity of e-4874, e-4904 and sparfloxacin (mic90 1 mg/l for each one) was higher than that of the rest of the agents tested. e-4874 (mic90 0.25 mg/l) was four-fold more active than the other antibacterials tested (mic90 2 mg/l) against listeria monocytogenes. no new quinolone was active against bacteroides fragilis (mic90s 4-16 mg/l), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l), and other b. fragilis group (mic90s 16- > 16 mg/l). ciprofloxacin (mic90s > 16 mg/l), and sparfloxacin (mic90s 8-16 mg/l) also were inactive. e-4874 (mic90 4 mg/l) was the most active quinolone tested against b.fragilis.
[staggered intensive chemotherapy using arbekacin, fosfomycin and ceftazidime on  polymicrobial infections involving mrsa].
bacteriological and clinical studies were carried out on staggered intensive chemotherapy regimen for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections combined with gram-negative opportunistic pathogens as polymicrobial infections. the regimen consisted of administering ceftazidime (caz) 30 minutes after infusion of arbekacin (abk) and a bolus injection of fosfomycin (fom). the combination of these drugs strongly inhibited the growth of mrsa and pseudomonas aeruginosa. by this combination treatment, both of mrsa and p. aeruginosa in mixed culture became more susceptible to killing by macrophages. we evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of combination of abk, fom and caz in the treatment of 15 patients with mrsa infections. the total efficacy rate was 80.0% and the bacterial eradication rate of mrsa was 60.0%. it is considered that staggered intensive chemotherapy with abk, fom and caz is useful for such polymicrobial infections involving mrsa.
[evaluation of bactericidal activity of arbekacin in mixed culture with mrsa and  pseudomonas aeruginosa using an in vitro pharmacokinetic simulation system].
the bactericidal activities of arbekacin (abk), vancomycin (vcm), gentamicin (gm) and netilmicin (ntl) in mixed culture with staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined using an in vitro computer programmed pharmacokinetic simulation system and also the protective effect of these agents on systemic infection in neutropenic mice was examined. in a mixed culture of s. aureus no. 235 (mrsa) and p. aeruginosa e7, abk showed a strong bactericidal activity and an inhibition of regrowth against both bacteria, and gm and ntl showed similar effects. on the other hand, vcm showed a bactericidal activity against s. aureus no. 235, but not against p. aeruginosa. in the protective study, abk was evidently more effective than gm, ntl or vcm against a systemic mixed infection of mice with s. aureus no. 235 and p. aeruginosa e7. in brief, the ed50 values of abk, vcm, gm and ntl were 19.5, > 100, 40.5 and 45.2 mg/kg, respectively.
[bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. ii. relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
the bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. in first examinations (i. communication) (19) the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. in this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. the bactericide effect on micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. this results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens. fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.
in vitro and in vivo evaluations of a-80556, a new fluoroquinolone.
a-80556 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. a-80556 was more active than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. a-80556 was particularly active against staphylococcus aureus (mic for 90% of isolates [mic90], 0.12 microgram/ml, relative to fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml). a-80556 was also the most active of the quinolones tested against ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, with an mic90 of 4.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was > 128 micrograms/ml. however, the significance of this activity is not known. a-80556 was slightly less active against escherichia coli (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml) and other enteric organisms than ciprofloxacin (mic90 for e. coli, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml). a-80556 was slightly less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml) than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml) and more active against acinetobacter spp. (respective mic90s, 0.12 and 0.5 microgram/ml). a-80556 was also the most active compound against anaerobes. against bacteroides fragilis, the mic90 of a-80556 was 2.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was 16 micrograms/ml. the in vivo efficacy of a-80556 in experimental models with both gram-positive and gram-negative infections was consistent with the in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics and oral absorption in mice.
multiple doses of contrast medium from a single container: bacteriological studies.
preparations of iopromide (ultravist 370; schering pty ltd, sydney, nsw, australia), brain/heart infusion broth (bhi; positive growth control) and distilled water (negative control) were inoculated with 10(3) to 10(4) pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli or staphylococcus aureus cells and incubated at 37 degrees c. slow decreases (up to one log) were observed in each organism's count in iopromide and distilled water at room temperature and in s. aureus and e. coli in iopromide and distilled water at 35 degrees c until 6-8 h, when counts stabilized. bhi cultures showed logarithmic increases. p. aeruginosa counts increased (half log over 8 h) in ultravist at 37 degrees c. radiology laboratories were shown to have similar airborne bacterial loads to operating theatres. samples from repeatedly entered iopromide bottles showed no contamination. multiple intravenous doses from a single bottle of non-ionic contrast medium can safely be used as a cost-saving measure provided scrupulous attention is paid to aseptic preparation. unused decanted contrast medium should be discarded after 4 h.
minimum inhibitory concentration quality-control guidelines for biapenem, du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, and ceftizoxime when using various national committee for clinical laboratory standards susceptibility test methods. quality control study group.
several multilaboratory collaborative studies using broth microdilution and agar  dilution (gonococcal tests only) methods of susceptibility testing were performed to establish quality-control (qc) giudelines. replicate dilution tests with multiple lots of media were performed with national committee for clinical laboratory standards recommended qc strains (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213) by using the following antimicrobials: biapenem, du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin. in addition qc mic ranges, using appropriate medium modification for haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247 and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 49226 were reported on four (du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin) and two (ceftizoxime and fk-037) antimicrobials, respectively.
inhibition of fungal growth by pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas cepacia isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.
this study was undertaken because of the infrequency of infections due to candida species in patients with cystic fibrosis despite their extensive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. in vitro susceptibility studies revealed significant inhibition of 11 strains of fungi known to infect human beings by 10 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and nine strains of pseudomonas cepacia isolated from the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis. the fungi were candida krusei, candida keyfr, candida guillermondii, candida tropicalis, candida lusitaniae, candida parapsilosis, candida pseudotropicalis, candida albicans, torulopsis glabrata, saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus fumigatus. inhibition of fungal growth by escherichia coli (nctc 10418), staphylococcus aureus (nctc 6571) and haemophilus influenzae (nctc 11931) could not be demonstrated. the continued presence in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis of strains of p. aeruginosa and p. cepacia, which produce antifungal substances, may inhibit growth of candida species and so prevent overt candida infections. a. fumigatus would seem to be the most important fungus causing disease in patients with cystic fibrosis. it is therefore interesting to note that this was the most resistant of all the fungi tested for inhibition by p. aeruginosa and p. cepacia.
comparative serum bactericidal activities of three doses of ciprofloxacin administered intravenously.
the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities of three intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin were studied comparatively in 30 patients. single 200-, 300-, and 400-mg intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin were given over 30 min to 10 patients each, and serum samples were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 h after the start of the infusion. serum drug concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by using noncompartmental analysis methods. serum bactericidal activity against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and staphylococcus aureus was determined for samples obtained at 0.5, 4, 8, and 12 h. excellent activity was demonstrated up to 12 h by all doses against e. coli and e. cloacae. much poorer titers were observed for the remaining organisms, although the 400-mg dose prompted improved results against p. aeruginosa with a mean bactericidal titer of 1:2.9 at 8 h. in conclusion, while the 200-mg dose appears to be largely adequate for infections caused by members of the family enterobacteriaceae, it seems that when p. aeruginosa is involved, 400 mg twice a day or even three times a day is more appropriate. intravenous ciprofloxacin performs poorly against a. calcoaceticus and s. aureus, even at a higher dose.
bactericidal properties of crude extracts of mitracarpus villosus.
mature leaves and inflorescence of mitracarpus villosus, collected from niger state, nigeria, were shade dried over a period of 5 days, ground into fine particles in a waring blender and extracted individually with hot distilled water and 95% ethanol. the crude extracts obtained were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activities using agar diffusion and tube dilution techniques. the extracts produced zones of inhibition (8-23 mm) against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus faecalis, while pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were not inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the effective extracts were in the range 0.06-8.0 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were in the range 0.06-32.0 mg/ml. the ethanolic extracts appeared to exert more inhibitory action against the bacteria than the hot water extracts.
[effect of 14-member lactone ring macrolides on anti staphylococcal activity and  swarming ability of pseudomonas aeruginosa].
the purpose of this report is to examine the effect of macrolides (erythromycin and roxythromycin) on swarming ability and antistaphylococcal activity of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the standard strain (atcc27854) and clinically isolated p. aeruginosa were used as test strains. the influence of macrolides on antistaphylococcal activity and swarming ability were determined by the agar plate dilution method. the antistaphylococcal activity of p. aeruginosa was not affected at the concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml of both erythromycin and roxythromycin. but the antistaphylococcal activity was not observed at the concentration over 100 micrograms/ml. the swarming ability was not affected at the concentration up to 12.5 micrograms/ml. it has been proved that macrolides reveal inhibition of virulent factors of p. aeruginosa such as protease, elastase, piocianin and so on. furthermore our data revealed that macrolides inhibited swarming ability of p. aeruginosa, and did not affect the antistaphylococcal activity of p. aeruginosa under 1.56 micrograms/ml concentration. consequently, these results suggest that macrolides have exhibited a previously unknown pharmacological effect, and may be of interest in that there may be bacterial interaction between mrsa and p. aeruginosa.
[statistic studies on bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections (report 6:  isolation rate and drug sensitivity from 1988 through 1989)].
we examined the bacteria isolated from urine of patients in our department from 1988 though 1989. a total of 809 strains were isolated from the outpatients. they were 241 strains of gram-positive bacteria (29.8%). e. coli (32.0%) was isolated most frequently, followed by enterococcus spp. (9.9%), proteus group (7.4%), s. epidermidis (6.2%), p. aeruginosa (5.1%) and others. a total of 412 strains were isolated from the inpatients. they consisted of 173 strains of gram-positive bacteria (42.0%). enterococcus spp. (17.0%) was isolated most frequently, followed by p. aeruginosa (12.6%), s. epidermidis (9.7%), e. coli (7.3%), s. aureus (6.6%) and others. fewer p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens and proteus group were isolated from the outpatients and fewer s. marcescens, e. coli and k. pneumoniae from inpatients than previously. more s. aureus were isolated abruptly from the inpatients and more e. coli were isolated from the outpatients than previously. e. cloacae, s. epidermidis, s. aureus and corynebacterium spp. all isolated from inpatients showed lower antimicrobial sensitivity than those isolated from the outpatients.
comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
the study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/l for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. for the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/l for ofloxacin. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) and serum bactericidal activity (sba) for each drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter anitratus, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against a. anitratus. mbcs for the two drugs were similar for h. influenzae and s. aureus. oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent sba. similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent sba. for the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak sba was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. at peak concentrations, both drugs had modest sba against p. aeruginosa, a. anitratus, and s. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
changing etiology of bacteremia in patients with hematological malignancies in denmark.
to ascertain whether the microbiological etiology of bacteremia among patients with hematological malignancies has changed in denmark, the species distribution of clinically relevant blood culture isolates from the hematological department at rigshospitalet, copenhagen in 1990 was compared with 2 previous studies (1970-72; 1981-85). in addition, time trends of the etiology of bacteremia among hematological patients in copenhagen (eastern denmark) and in arhus (western denmark) were compared. in contrast to many other studies, a significant increase in the proportion of gram-negative aerobes was observed in copenhagen (from 43% in 1981-85 to 55% in 1990; p < 0.05), whereas in arhus the proportion of gram-positive aerobes increased steadily during the 1980s (from 34% to 51%; p < 0.05). in copenhagen, non-hemolytic streptococci and xanthomonas maltophilia increased significantly and accounted for 10% (p < 0.01) and 5% (p < 0.05) respectively, of all isolates in 1990, whereas staphylococcus aureus during the 2 decades studied decreased from 25% to 8% (p < 0.001). in both regions, a decrease was observed in the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa which accounted for only about 5% of all isolates in 1990. no changes were observed in the rates of anaerobes and yeasts. several factors may contribute to the reported differences in the etiology of bacteremia among hematological patients, e.g. criteria used to assign the clinical significance of the isolate, blood culture system used, practice of using indwelling intravenous catheters, different policies with respect to antimicrobial treatment, and the degree of immunosuppression. a local surveillance of blood culture isolates is mandatory if changes in etiology and resistance development are to be detected.
influence of dextrose dialysis solutions on adhesion of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa to three catheter surfaces.
peritonitis is serious problem associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. the process can be initiated by intraluminal contamination and colonization of the peritoneal cavity as well as by bacterial adhesion to biomaterials, including catheters and exit site dressings. the aim of this study was to determine the degree to which two pathogenic organisms could adhere to three biomaterial surfaces, and the extent to which dextrose concentration influenced the binding and survival. using a 24-hour in vitro assay, it was found that the staphylococcus aureus strain consistently adhered significantly better than the pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate, and only the adhesion of the latter was decreased with higher concentrations of dextrose in dialysis solutions. electron microscopy demonstrates that within this short time period, bacterial biofilms had begun to form on the catheter surfaces.
antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
the antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates. cefepime was active at low concentrations (mic50 values < or = 0.06 mg/l and mic90 values < or = 0.12 mg/l) against non-cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.). for klebsiella pneumoniae, mics were between 0.016 and 16 mg/l; the highest mic values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. against enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing enterobacter cloacae, mics were < or = 0.5 mg/l, but mics against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. ticarcillin-sensitive strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/l, while cefepime mics were 8-64 mg/l for strains resistant to ticarcillin. the cefepime mic50 value for haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/l. against methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus, cefepime mics were 0.5-16 mg/l; mics against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/l). against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime mic values were 0.03-16 mg/l; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains were 2-128 mg/l. streptococci (groups a, c and g) were sensitive to cefepime with mics ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/l (mic50, 0.03 mg/l; mic90, 0.25 mg/l). the activity of cefepime against group b streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with mic50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively, and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. most enterococci and all listeria monocytogenes strains had mics > or = 32 mg/l.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
in-vitro activity of cefepime and other antimicrobials: survey of european isolates.
cefepime, a new cephalosporin which has a broad-spectrum of activity was tested in vitro against 1961 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates obtained from european hospitals. cefepime was highly active against gram-negative organisms, inhibiting over 94% of strains tested. the overall susceptibility rate for cefepime against all isolates was 81%. cefepime was more active than any of the third-generation cephalosporins tested against species capable of producing type i beta-lactamases, e.g. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes. the activity of cefepime against pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of ceftazidime and substantially greater than those of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. all cephalosporins except ceftazidime exhibited high activity against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus but poor activity was observed against methicillin-resistant strains. overall susceptibility to cefepime is lower in europe than it is in north america.
serum bactericidal activity after administration of four cephalosporins in healthy volunteers.
serum bactericidal activity (sba) was determined against ten strains each of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter cloacae in six volunteers 1 h and 4 h after intravenous infusion of 1 g and 2 g cefotaxime and cefmenoxime, and 2 g flomoxef, and against ten strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa after infusion of 1 g and 2 g ceftazidime. flomoxef showed the highest sba against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. all cephalosporins had high sba against gram-negative rods. cefotaxime had the highest sba against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the sba against pseudomonas aeruginosa after 1 g and 2 g doses of ceftazidime was very similar.
[antimicrobial activities of polymyxin b against clinically isolated microbial strains. results of mic determination including high concentrations].
minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for polymyxin b (pl-b),  gentamicin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin against clinically isolated microbial strains collected since november 1992, and the following conclusions were obtained: 1. judging from the mic distribution of pl-b against the studied strains including multi-drug resistant organisms of major strains of family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, it appeared that no pl-b resistant strains were detected among those gram-negative organisms within the antimicrobial spectrum of pl-b. 2. mics of pl-b against most strains including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were distributed between 100 and 800 micrograms/ml. these results supported reports of other investigators that the eradication of staphylococcus spp. including mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) was possible by the use of pl-b at 1 mg/ml. 3. mic distribution of pl-b against organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group was almost the same as the results described above.
the antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefpirome and 6 other beta-lactam antibacterial agents against clinical isolates.
the in vitro activity of cefpirome (cpr) was compared with that of cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm), flomoxef (fmox), cefotaxime (ctx), ceftazidime (caz) and imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs) against 384 clinical isolates, for tested by the both microdilution method. the activity of cpr against staphylococcus aureus (mic50, 1 microgram/ml) and enterococcus faecalis (mic50, 8 micrograms/ml) was better than ctx and caz, but slightly less than ipm/cs. cpr and other antibacterial agents were not effect against methicillin resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecium. the activity of cpr against enterobacteriaceae was as good as that of ctx, caz, and ipm/cs, and more effective than cez, ctm and fmox. the mic50 of cpr for acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2 micrograms/ml) and the mic50 of cpr for pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 micrograms/ml) were as good as that of caz. conclusionly, cpr was a new broad spectrum cephalosporin as compared with used cephalosporins.
[prevalence of bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility: a multicenter study in akita prefecture].
we report the prevalence of bacterial pathogens isolated from various clinical specimens in 17 medical centers in akita during the period of december 1990 to february 1991, and their antimicrobial susceptibility. the results were as follows: 1. the total number of isolates was 8,929 and common bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), escherichia coli (10.1%), coagulase negative staphylococcus (6.7%) and enterococcus faecalis (5.0%). this is similar to our previous result which was reported in the same season in 1987. 2. s. aureus was a common isolate from sputum, throat swab, pus, and blood. 53% of isolated s. aureus were methicillin-resistant. arbekacin (abk) had a high degree of activity (99%) against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). minocycline (mino) retained activity against 70% of mrsa strains, and quinolones only 20%. 3. p. aeruginosa and e. coli were frequently found in urine from the patients in the small hospitals. more than 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains were sensitive to imipenem (ipm), cefsulodin (cfs) and amikacin (amk). the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime (caz) and piperacillin (pipc) had been decreasing for the last 3 years. 4. cns were frequently found in blood, pus, and pleural effusion from the patients in the large hospitals. the isolates were resistant to most antibiotics. 5. enterococcus was common isolates from urine and ascites, the susceptibility to cephem was low. 6. we conclude that attention should be specially paid to s. aureus, p. aeruginosa cns and e. faecalis.
antibacterial activity of multilayer silver-copper surface films on catheter material.
the antimicrobial activity of ag, cu, and layered ag-cu surface films, sputter-coated onto several types of catheter material, against clinical isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus was evaluated. when 20 microl of a suspension of s. epidermidis or s. aureus (2.68 x 10(6) colony-forming units/ml) was applied onto ag-cu- or cu-coated butyl rubber, bacterial numbers were greatly reduced within 10 h, and eliminated within 24 h. in contrast, antibacterial activity was significantly less on uncoated or ag-coated surfaces. ag-cu- or cu-coated silicon rubber, polyvinylchloride, and teflon were even more effective than ag-cu- or cu-coated butyl rubber. ag-cu layered surface films also showed antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation. multiple metal surface film combinations show great promise in lowering the incidence of device-associated nosocomial infections.
in vitro activities of bay y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
bay y3118 was highly active against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). for enterococcus faecalis and corynebacterium jeikeium, mic90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. bay y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
the north american component (the united states and canada) of an international comparative mic trial monitoring ofloxacin resistance.
common lots of reference mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in february-april 1992. five medical centers in the united states and canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). quality-control strains were processed concurrently, mics recorded, and data processed at a common location. selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and p. aeruginosa; (d) cross resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.
multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
[in vitro antibacterial activity of isoxazolyl++ naphthoquinones. i].
the in vitro antibacterial activity of 2-hydroxy-n-(3,4-dimethyl-5-isoxazolyl) 1,4 naphthoquinone-4-imine (i) and three of this derivatives against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis y morganella morganii was investigated. from the four naphthoquinone-imine studied, compound i exhibited activity against s. aureus. this effect was observed even in oxygen atmosphere with 5% co2 and in the presence of human albumin. the development of drug-resistant strains by serial passage in media with concentrations lower than the c.i.m. was determined in 31 strains of s. aureus from clinical material and one from collection. no significant differences in c.i.m. were observed.
[efficacy of fibronectin on opsonic activity by alveolar macrophage and experimental rat pneumonia].
the opsonic activity of plasma fibronectin (fn) by rat alveolar macrophage (am) was examined, and the in vivo effect of fn in staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) experimental rat pneumonia was evaluated. the chemiluminescence response of am was enhanced by the presence of fn (300 micrograms/ml) in s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, but was not enhanced in gram-negative rods (haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa). fn (300 micrograms/ml) promoted the phagocytosis of s. aureus by am, but did not promote the bactericidal activity of that by am. in the experimental rat pneumonia with s. aureus inoculation, plasma fn concentration decreased with time, but increased by the administration of fn (1 mg). the number of bacteria in the lung, peripheral white blood cell and bal fluid cell also decreased by the administration of fn. furthermore, fn was significantly improved on inflammatory findings of rat lung tissue 24 hours after inoculation with s. aureus. these results suggest that fn plays an important role as an opsonic by alveolar macrophage, and that fn has utility for clinical trials in patients with pneumonia.
ciprofloxacin-induced, low-level resistance to structurally unrelated antibiotics in pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
the effects of ciprofloxacin on the rates of development of low-level resistance  to other antibiotics were determined in vitro. three methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and two pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains were grown overnight in mueller-hinton broth with or without subinhibitory concentrations (1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 mics) of ciprofloxacin or an aminoglycoside and then quantitatively plated onto medium containing 4 or 8 times the mics of various antibiotics. the spontaneous mutational frequencies were determined and compared with those of cells not exposed to ciprofloxacin. exposure of methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains to ciprofloxacin resulted in a > 100-fold increase in the isolation of variants with decreased susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, imipenem, fusidic acid, and gentamicin, but not vancomycin. likewise, a > 100-fold increase in the isolation of variants with decreased susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin and imipenem (35-fold) in p. aeruginosa a21213 was observed, and a > 100-fold increase in the isolation of variants with decreased susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and cefepime in p. aeruginosa a22379 was observed. on the other hand, exposure of these strains to an aminoglycoside did not influence the development of resistance to nonaminoglycoside drugs. these results indicate that exposure to subinhibitory levels of ciprofloxacin can promote the development of low-level resistance to antibiotics with different modes of action.
synthetic peptides of human lysosomal cathepsin g with potent antipseudomonal activity.
enzymatically active and inactive (diisopropylfluorophosphate-treated) cathepsin  g exerted antibacterial action in vitro against staphylococcus aureus, whereas only enzymatically active cathepsin g displayed bactericidal action against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in order to further test the requirement for protease activity for the antipseudomonal action of cathepsin g, synthetic peptides spanning the full-length mature protein were prepared and examined for antibacterial action. surprisingly, three structurally distinct peptides that correspond to residues 61 to 80, 117 to 136, and 198 to 223 within the full-length protein were found to exert potent antipseudomonal action (> 4.5 logs of killing at 500 micrograms/ml) against p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 and four mucoid clinical isolates. only the peptide (cg117-136) corresponding to residues 117 to 136 (117-rpgtlctvagwgrvsmrrgt-136) within cathepsin g exerted antibacterial action against the gram-positive pathogen s. aureus. the antipseudomonal action of cg117-136 was rapid and could be inhibited either by increasing concentrations of nacl or by 0.5 mm mgcl2 plus 0.5 mm cacl2, and these conditions appeared to reduce binding of the peptide to whole bacteria. variants of peptide cg117-136 lacking either a hydrophobic n-terminal domain or a positively charged c-terminal domain were found to have significantly less antipseudomonal action than cg117-136. the antibacterial capacity of the all-d-enantiomeric form of peptide cg117-136 was found to be identical to that of the all-l-peptide, suggesting that the mechanism of killing does not require the recognition of a target site possessing a chiral center.
comparative activity of the new fluoroquinolone rufloxacin (mf 934) against clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
the antibacterial activity of the new fluoroquinolone rufloxacin (mf 934) was evaluated against 1095 clinical isolates and compared with that of other quinolones and various commonly used antibiotics. rufloxacin was highly effective against members of the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 98% of the isolates at a concentration of 1 mg/l. ninety-two percent of aeromonas hydrophila and 65% acinetobacter strains tested were inhibited by 1 mg/l of rufloxacin, whereas 98% of methicillin-susceptible and 87% of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci strains required 4 mg/l for growth inhibition. the mic values of rufloxacin for most bacteria were 4-16 times higher than those of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. rufloxacin had little activity against xanthomonads, pseudomonads and enterococci. approximately 95-96% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 2 mg/l of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin as compared to 29% inhibited by rufloxacin at this concentration.
comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
the post-antibiotic effect of antimicrobial combinations in a neutropenic murine  thigh infection model.
the post-antibiotic effect (pae) may allow for more widely spaced dosing of antibiotics than is currently employed without loss of efficacy. antimicrobial combinations are widely used in clinical medicine. however, dosing schedules are usually based on pharmacological profiles of the drugs used alone. previously we have demonstrated significant prolongation of the pae induced by antimicrobial combinations in vitro as compared to paes induced by the agents alone. we examined this issue further in vivo in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model, by exposing staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae to several antimicrobials, either singly or in combination. the pae in vivo was defined as the difference in time needed for the organisms in the treated animals to grow 1 log10 as compared with controls after serum drug concentrations had fallen below the mic. drug concentrations exceeded the mic for 1.2-3.2 h, but bactericidal activity occurred mainly during the first hour. when the agents were used singly a negative pae was produced by ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa, a pae of approximately 0 h by imipenem against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, a pae of 2-4 h by cefazolin against s. aureus, gentamicin against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and imipenem and tobramycin against p. aeruginosa, and a pae of 6-7 h by gentamicin against s. aureus and rifampicin against p. aeruginosa. the beta-lactam/aminoglycoside combinations when used against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa prolonged the pae by 1.0-3.3 h, compared with the longer of the individual drug paes, but no prolongation was observed against e. coli and k. pneumoniae. ceftazidime reduced the pae when used with tobramycin against p. aeruginosa. the long pae of rifampicin against p. aeruginosa was 'carried over' to the combination, thus prolonging the growth suppression achieved by imipenem and tobramycin alone or in combination by 5.5-8.0 h. this effect on the pae was additive only, and synergy was not observed. in conclusion, a potentially significant prolongation of the pae by combination of drugs was observed in vivo, but only if both (or all) agents induced a pae when used alone. the impact of this observation needs to be examined further in studies involving multiple and different dosing regimens in an infection model.
nosocomial infections in intensive care units: an overview of their epidemiology, outcome, and prevention.
among all hospitalized patients, icu patients are at greatest risk for both endemic and epidemic nosocomial infections. the highest infection rates are seen in surgical, burn, trauma, and neonatal icus. acquisition of infection is a major determinant of mortality in icus, and prolongs the length of icu stay. predominant pathogens include pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and candida spp. they are more likely to be resistant to antimicrobial agents than are isolates from elsewhere in the hospital. exposure to invasive medical devices is the predominant risk factor for infection, and strategies to prevent infection are aimed at reducing microbial colonization on and around devices. improvements in technology, such as coating devices with antimicrobial agents, have been shown to be efficacious in preventing infection. handwashing, particularly with antiseptic soaps, remains the cornerstone of infection control in the icu.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk-037, a parenteral cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk-037, 5-amino-2-[[(6r, 7r)-7-[[(z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2- methoxyimino) acetyl] amino]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1- azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1h-pyrazoli um hydroxide, inner salt, sulfate (1:1), a new parenteral cephem, was compared with those of cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. fk-037 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylocci at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. of 98 isolates of homogenous methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 55 (56.1%) were inhibited by 8 micrograms of fk-037 per ml, compared to 3.1% for cefepime. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam tested against staphylococci. the mic of fk-037 for 90% of the strains tested (mic90) was 0.06 micrograms/ml for hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and streptococcus bovis. the mic90 for many of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae was 1 microgram/ml, similar to that of cefepime and lower than those of ceftazidime and imipenem. the mic90 for klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae was 8 micrograms/ml, similar to that for cefepime, but all isolates were inhibited by 2 micrograms of imipenem per ml. k. pneumoniae isolates with cefotaxime and ceftazidime mics of > 32 micrograms/ml with bush type 2b' beta-lactamases were inhibited by 4 micrograms of fk-037 per ml. e. cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and s. aureus stably resistant to fk-037 could be selected by repeated transfer in the presence of fk-037. the fk-037 mic90 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 4 microgram/ml, compared to 32 microgram/ml for cefepime and ceftazidime and 8 microgram/ml for imipenem. xanthomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter anitratus, and bacteroides species were resistant to fk-037 (mic, more than or equal 32 microgram/ml). mbcs were identical to or within twofold of the mics except for a 32-fold greater mbc for p. aeruginosa. inoculum size and acid environment did not lower the activity of fk-037. fk-037 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by bush group 1, 2a, 2b, and 2e beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by 2b' and 2d enzymes at rates comparable to that of ceftazidime. nonetheless, fk-037 inhibited bacteria possessing tem-3, -5, and -7 and shv -5 at less than or equal 8 microgram/ml. overall, fk-037 has lower mics against staphylococci and p. aeruginosa than the currently available iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporins and has activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae comparable to that of cefepime.
in vitro activity of cefdinir (fk 482, pd 134393, ci-983): a new orally active cephalosporin.
cefdinir is a new orally active cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other beta-lactam antibiotics against clinical isolates or enterobacteriaceae (625 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (68 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (36 strains), acinetobacter (52 strains), aeromonas hydrophilia (47 strains), staphylococci (364 strains) and enterococci (50 strains). against most members of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter and a. hydrophilia, cefdinir showed excellent activity, inhibiting 94% of these isolates at < or = 32 micrograms/ml. like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against p. aeruginosa and x. maltophilia. all the 120 isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by < 1.0 microgram/ml of cefdinir whereas 80% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus had a minimum inhibitory concentration of > 32 micrograms/ml. of the 50 isolates of enterococci tested, 94% were inhibited by < or = 16.0 micrograms/ml of cefdinir. against enterobacteriaceae, its activity was superior to any oral drug tested. with the exception of vancomycin, the in vitro activity of cefdinir was superior or comparable to other antibiotics tested against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci.
in vitro activity of ototopical drops against middle ear pathogens.
five types of ear drops were each assessed for effectiveness on the basis of the  in vitro antibacterial activity. staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from purulent otitis media were evaluated by comparative analysis. otic drops containing new fluorinated quinolones, ofloxacin and ny-198, showed high in vitro activity against all the bacteria. cortisporin expressed moderate activity against p. aeruginosa and relatively weak activity against s. aureus and mrsa. bestron and fosmicin possessed low activity against three clinical isolates. otic drops containing the new quinolones may be effective for treating purulent otitis media infected by mrsa and p. aeruginosa.
investigation of synergism between combinations of ciprofloxacin, polymyxin, sulphadiazine and p-aminobenzoic acid.
subinhibitory concentrations of combinations of any two of ciprofloxacin, colistin (or polymyxin b), sodium sulphadiazine and p-aminobenzoic acid were shown by checkerboard minimum inhibitory concentration determinations to have synergistic inhibitory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and to have either synergistic or additive activity against staphylococcus aureus. in addition, sulphadiazine plus either ciprofloxacin or polymyxin showed markedly enhanced killing activity against both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. p-aminobenzoic acid plus either ciprofloxacin or polymyxin also demonstrated enhanced killing activity against p. aeruginosa but these combinations were less effective in enhancing activity against s. aureus. ciprofloxacin in combination with polymyxin had a marked synergistic effect against p. aeruginosa but only a slight synergistic effect against s. aureus. these findings indicate a potential usefulness for the synergistic combinations against p. aeruginosa and s. aureus in the clinical situation; that is, they indicate an extended role for sulphonamides and support a potential role for p-aminobenzoic acid as enhancers of the activity of primary antibacterial agents such as ciprofloxacin and polymyxin. we suggest that for a second antibacterial to enhance the activity of ciprofloxacin, it may be necessary for the second antibacterial to increase cell permeability so increasing bacterial uptake of ciprofloxacin.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is an oxime-type cephem antibiotic with a  1-hydroxyethyl-5-amino-pyrazole moiety at the 3 position. fk037 was evaluated for antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, fk037 was twofold or more active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic for 90% of the strains [mic90] = 32 micrograms/ml), members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic90 < or = 2 micrograms/ml), group a streptococci (mic90 = 0.015 microgram/ml), and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). in addition, the activity of fk037 was equal to or greater than that of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 0.12 microgram/ml) and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). fk037 was more active in vitro than cefepime (two- to fourfold) and cefpirome (twofold) against s. aureus. in murine systemic infection models, fk037 showed potent activity against p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant s. aureus. fk037 was also efficacious in a mouse model of pyelonephritis caused by s. aureus or klebsiella pneumoniae and in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia caused by s. pneumoniae. additional studies on this compound to assess its potential clinical utility are warranted.
effect of formulation ph and storage temperatures on the preservative efficacy of some gases used as propellants in cosmetic aerosols.
the effects of changes in formulation ph and storage temperature on the preservative activities of some aerosol propellants--butane, carbon dioxide, dimethylether and their combinations were investigated. a preservative challenge test method was used to determine the survival rates of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and aspergillus niger at formulation ph levels 5.80, 7.28 and 8.10 and storage temperatures of 20 degrees, 30 degrees and 40 degrees c. a significant decrease in the ph of formulations was observed with no corresponding changes in the antimicrobial effectiveness when carbon dioxide was incorporated. alterations in the antimicrobial profiles of these propellants due to changes in formulation ph were dependent on the propellant and the species of the micro-organism, especially when single propellants were used. results also showed that the propellants exert antimicrobial activities against the various organisms at the three storage temperatures but there were significantly greater inhibitory activities at 40 degrees c. with a combination of 10% butane/dimethylether (1:2) and 10 bar carbon dioxide there were no differences in the degree of microbial inhibition at the various formulation ph levels and storage temperatures. in most cases, the organisms were completely inactivated within 24 h. these findings showed that the combination of butane/dimethylether with carbon dioxide could be used to protect against microbial contamination and spoliage of formulations of different ph levels as well as those meant for storage at different temperatures.
in vivo antibacterial activity of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
fk037 has potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections and experimental local infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. in murine systemic infections, fk037 was the most effective of the cephalosporins and imipenem tested against highly methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa). it was more effective than ceftazidime against selected strains of s. aureus and enterobacteriaceae, except serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was as effective as ceftazidime and was as effective as cefpirome against all organisms tested, except mrsa and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was more effective than cefpirome. these results correlated well with its in vitro activity. in murine local infections, with few exceptions, fk037 was more effective than ceftazidime and cefpirome against klebsiella pneumonia in ed50 values and against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) subcutaneous abscess, pyelonephritis with staphylococcus epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, intrauterine infections with s. aureus and e. coli in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the abscess, kidneys and uterus. it is noteworthy that the therapeutic effects of fk037 were more potent than had been anticipated from its in vitro activity against local infections with staphylococci and p. aeruginosa when compared with ceftazidime or cefpirome. in addition, the therapeutic effects of fk037 were equipotent or superior to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime against pneumonia due to mssa, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs in mice using an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations after drip infusion of usual clinical doses (0.25 to 1.0 g for mssa, 0.063 to 0.125 g for k. pneumoniae and 1.0 to 2.0 g for p. aeruginosa). fk037 induced an in vivo post-antibiotic effect (pae) of 3.4 hours against a thigh infection with mssa in neutropenic mice. these results strongly suggest that it has potential for clinical use against various infections due to bacteria which include staphylococci and p. aeruginosa.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
fk037 is a new parenteral cephalosporin, which offers some advantages over the commercially available parenteral cephalosporins. it demonstrated potent broad-spectrum activity against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa. against clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive bacteria, fk037, like cefpirome, demonstrated more potent activity than ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. it is noteworthy that fk037, on the basis of the mic90s, was the most active of all the cephalosporins tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). it was similar in activity to cefpirome against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa). against clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria, fk037, like cefpirome, was superior to cefoperazone, similar to ceftazidime and inferior to ceftizoxime in activity. against p. aeruginosa, fk037 was superior to cefoperazone, similar or slightly superior to cefpirome and inferior to ceftazidime in activity. however, fk037 exhibited significant activity against citrobacter and enterobacter which were highly resistant to ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. fk037 had an advantage in that its bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa at sub-mics (1/2 or 1/4 the mic) was much stronger than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. moreover, it exhibited potent bactericidal activity against mssa, mrsa and p. aeruginosa in a pharmacokinetic in vitro model simulating human plasma concentrations after intravenous dosage of 0.125, 1.0 and 1.0 g, respectively. fk037 inhibited essential penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), 1, 2 and 3 of s. aureus with a 50% inhibitory concentration (i50) of 0.58 micrograms/ml or lower. of essential pbps 3, 1a and 1b of e. coli and p. aeruginosa, fk037 inhibited pbp 3 at the lowest i50 (0.03 and 0.04 micrograms/ml, respectively) and pbps 1a and 1b with i50 values of 2.7 micrograms/ml or lower. fk037, like cefpirome, was highly stable to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases except ic cephalosporinase from bacteroides fragilis, and had extremely low affinity for beta-lactamases. therefore, fk037 was more potent than ceftazidime in activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria except p. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. the ability of fk037 to penetrate the outer membrane of e. coli was slightly higher than that of ceftazidime, but slightly lower than that of cefpirome.
[study of combinations of antimicrobial agents. development of the method].
we developed and validated a micromethod similar to the checkerboard method in antibiotherapy to study the efficiency of antiseptic and disinfectant molecules. the determination of the fbc index (fractional bactericidal concentration) on 4 reference strains (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae) for 4 associations (2-benzyl-4 chlorophenol--iodophor; cetrimide-iodophor, 2 benzyl-4 chlorophenol--formaldehyde; hexamidine--formaldehyde) revealed 2 synergistic associations and 2 antagonistic associations for one or more strains.
in vitro susceptibility of selected non-protozoa to mefloquine.
mefloquine, an antimalarial, was tested against several bacteria and a yeast. it  has moderate activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and escherichia coli and no measured activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans.
[clinical and experimental study of xiao er ke cuan ling oral liquid in the treatment of infantile bronchopneumonia].
xiao er ke chuan ling oral liquid (kcl) is a chinese herbal preparation consisted of 10 herbs such as prunus armeniacae, scutelaria baicalensis, lonicera japonica etc. 30 children suffering from bronchopneumonia and/or acute bronchitis were treated with kcl (treated group) and another 30 cases were treated with penicillin and aminophylline (control group). results: cure rate and effective rate in treated group was 26.6%, and 93.3% respectively. while in control group was 30% and 96.6% respectively. no significant differences were seen between them(p > 0.05). the pharmacodynamic experiment showed kcl had potent pharmacological action. the experiment on tracheal fragment of guinea pig in vitro showed it caused moderately strong smooth muscle relaxation, through inhibition the effect of histamine and acetylcholine. asthma induction experiment of guinea pig in vivo showed kcl could significantly prolong the latent period of asthma and alleviate asthmatic symptom. ammonium water cough induction experiment in mice showed it may apparently prolong cough latent period and reduce times of cough relapse and alleviate cough symptom. kcl had potent antipyretic effect on fever model induced by triple vaccine in rabbits. bacteriostatic and antiviral experiment in vitro showed the drug had quite strong inhibitory effects for streptococcus hemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, flexners dysentery bacillus, diplococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it could potently inhibit the respiratory syncytial virus. kcl is an effective drug in treating bronchopneumonia and acute bronchitis.
antimicrobial resistance: patterns and trends in the national university hospital, singapore (1989-1991).
the commonly isolated organisms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, proteus species and enterobacter species from clinical material other than blood, cerebrospinal fluid and stool, were analysed for their incidence and increasing trends of resistance to the commonly used antimicrobials. staphylococcus aureus was tested against penicillin, methicillin, erythromycin, gentamicin and co-trimoxazole; pseudomonas aeruginosa against amikacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and cefsulodin; and gram negative bacilli against ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, cephalexin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin. methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus exhibited a high degree of resistance to penicillin only (83%), but methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (34-46%) showed nearly 100% resistance to all drugs tested except for co-trimoxazole over the period of study. a high incidence of resistance was found among klebsiella species, enterobacter species, acinetobacter species and pseudomonas species. increasing trends of resistance against cephalosporins were noticed with respect to acinetobacter species, klebsiella species and enterobacter species for cefuroxime and ceftriaxone; pseudomonas aeruginosa for ceftazidime and cefsulodin. the overall resistance of organisms is notably high. methicillin-resistant s. aureus is endemic and accounts for about 39% of all s. aureus isolates. the typical nosocomial organisms like acinetobacter species and klebsiella species are increasingly developing resistance to useful drugs such as gentamicin, cephalexin and ceftriaxone.
2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline n-oxide, an antistaphylococcal agent produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa produce low molecular weight, hydrophobic substances which inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus and other gram-positive organisms. the active substances have been purified from a culture of p. aeruginosa and characterized as a mixture of 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline n-oxide and its homologues. the alkyl-hydroxyquinolines (derived through reduction of the n-oxide) were also produced by p. aeruginosa cultures but, in general, were less active against s. aureus. 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline was identified in a sample of human bronchial secretions from a patient with cystic fibrosis who was heavily colonized with p. aeruginosa. production of antibacterial alkyl-hydroxyquinoline n-oxides in human lung may explain the observation that the presence of p. aeruginosa in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis is correlated with the absence of s. aureus.
[evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefazolin alone and in combination with cefmetazole or flomoxef using agar dilution method and disk diffusion method].
antimicrobial activities of cefazolin (cez) against 251 strains of various clinical isolates obtained during 1989 and 1990 were determined using the mueller-hinton agar dilution method at an inoculum level 10(6) cfu/ml. the reliability of the disk susceptility test was also studied using mueller-hinton agar and various disks at inoculum levels of 10(3-4) cfu/cm2 in estimating approximate values of mics. in addition, antimicrobial activities of cez and cefmetazole (cmz) or flomoxef (fmox) in combination were investigated against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa) using the checkerboard agar dilution mic method and the disk diffusion test either with the disks contained cez, cmz, and fmox alone, or cez, and cmz or fmox in combination. in this study, the mics of cez against s. aureus were distributed with the 3 peak values at 0.39 microgram/ml, 3.13 micrograms/ml and > 100 micrograms/ml. mics against mssa were 0.39 microgram/ml to 0.78 microgram/ml, whereas those against mrsa were greater than 0.78 microgram/ml. mics against majority of strains of enterococcus faecalis were 25 micrograms/ml. over 90% of strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at the level of 3.13 micrograms/ml. about 60% of isolates of indole negative proteus spp. were inhibited at the levels of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml and 100% at 6.25 micrograms/ml, but mics against indole positive proteus spp., serratia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were over 100 micrograms/ml. the antimicrobial activities of cez against these clinical isolates were not significantly different compared to those reported about 15-20 years ago, except for s. aureus. highly resistant strains of s. aureus to cez were more prevalent in this study. the inhibitory zones obtained with the disk test were compared with mics. the results of cez disk susceptibility test with 30 micrograms disk (showa) or 10 micrograms disk (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with mics (r = -0.837 and -0.814, respectively), showing the reliavility of the disk method in estimating approximate values of mics. in the 4 category classification system currently used in japan, break points in mic values proposed are () mic < or = 3 micrograms/ml, (++) > 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) > 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) > 60 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 7.7% and false negative in 6.8% of the samples. the disk results with e. faecalis showed a higher ratio of false positive results.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
antibiotic screening of medicinal plants of the british columbian native peoples.
one hundred methanolic plant extracts, 96 of which had documented medicinal uses  by british columbian native peoples, were screened for antibiotic activity against 11 bacterial strains. eighty-five percent were found to have significant antibiotic activity against at least two of the bacteria tested. ninety-five percent of the plants categorized as potential antibiotics based on their ethnobotanical usage were found to exhibit significant antibiotic activity. seventy-five were found to be active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 46 were active against an antibiotic supersusceptible strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 18 of these were also active against a wild type strain. the extracts with the broadest spectra of activity were prepared from: alnus rubra bark and catkins, fragaria chiloensis leaves, moneses uniflora aerial parts, and rhus glabra branches.
comparative study of pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin.
we compared the pharmacokinetics and the serum bactericidal activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. fifteen healthy volunteers received 1 g of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone intravenously, 500 mg of imipenem-cilastatin intravenously, and 500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally. high-performance liquid chromatographic assays were used to quantitate unchanged antibiotic in plasma and urine. serum bactericidal activities were determined against six clinical isolates each of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa by using a modified microdilution method of reller and stratton (l. b. reller and c. w. stratton, j. infect. dis. 136:196-204, 1977). overall, cefpirome exhibited pharmacokinetics similar to those of ceftazidime: half-life (t1/2), 1.95 h; concentration at 1 h (c1h), 47 to 49 micrograms/ml for both antibiotics. ceftriaxone displayed the longest t1/2 (7.65 h) and the highest c1h (137.8 micrograms/ml), while we observed the shortest t1/2 (1.05 h) and the lowest c1h (19.85 micrograms/ml) with imipenem. at 1 h, cefpirome and, even more so, imipenem showed significantly better serum bactericidal activities against s. aureus (1:273 and 1:80) than did the other antibiotics (p less than 0.0005; analysis of variance with randomized block design and bonferroni correction). against e. cloacae, we observed the highest serum bactericidal titers at 1 h with cefpirome, and this superiority vis-a-vis the other antibiotics tested was maintained for up to 8 h after dosing. ceftazidime remained the most active agent tested against p. aeruginosa (serum bactericidal activity titers, 1:43 at 1 h) up to 8 h. in summary, the study showed that cefpirome and imipenem provide more potent serum bactericidal activities than do broad-spectrum cephalosporins against s. aureus; thus, both of these antibiotics should be adequate against serious s. aureus infections. in addition, cefpirome appears to be a promising alternative for treatment of infections caused by e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
in vitro activity of l-627, a new carbapenem.
the in vitro activity of l-627, a new parenterally administered carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, fce 22101 (a penem), ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. l-627 was active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90] ranging from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml). l-627 displayed activity equal to that of meropenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), although, as with other carbapenems, the antipseudomonal activity was reduced against d2-deficient strains. staphylococci and streptococci were susceptible (mic90 of 1.0 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus aureus and 0.015 micrograms/ml for group a streptococci). l-627 also had activity against anaerobic bacteria (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml for bacteroides fragilis). neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis were highly susceptible (mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml), and against the common respiratory pathogens (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis), the mic90s were less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml. the protein binding of l-627 ranged from 13.8 to 22%, depending on the concentration. the presence of human serum had little effect on the mic or mbc of l-627. these results suggest that l-627 merits further study in the treatment of infections caused by a wide range of pathogens.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of e1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
e1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the in vitro activities of e1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic of e1077 for 90% of the strains tested [mic90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mic90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. against enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), e1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. the mic90s of e1077 for streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; e1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. e1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of serratia marcescens and proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). the activity of e1077 against p. aeruginosa (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. in vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. e1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. the protective effects of e1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of e1077 caused swelling of s. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in p. aeruginosa. in general, the antibacterial profile of e1077 is similar to that of cefpirome.
induction of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) and interleukin-1 (il-1) by pseudomonas  aeruginosa and exotoxin a-induced suppression of lymphoproliferation and tnf, lymphotoxin, gamma interferon, and il-1 production in human leukocytes.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dominant pathogen in infection in cystic fibrosis. this bacterium is thought to play a major role in the chronic bronchial infection-induced pathophysiology. our data showed that whole formalin-fixed heat-killed p. aeruginosa was mitogenic for human lymphocytes and induced production of substantial amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf) in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes in cultures. significant amounts of tnf were produced at 10(3) bacteria per 2 x 10(5) mononuclear leukocytes. treatment of p. aeruginosa with polymixin b did not affect its ability to stimulate tnf production, suggesting that bacterial lipopolysaccharide is not involved. p. aeruginosa, however, did not stimulate production of the t-cell lymphokine lymphotoxin (tnf beta). exotoxin a, considered to be an important virulence factor produced by p. aeruginosa, did not stimulate either lymphoproliferation or production of tnf. in fact, this toxin, at nontoxic concentrations, was found to depress lymphoproliferation induced by phytohemagglutinin and staphylococcus aureus and decreased production of tnf, lymphotoxin, and gamma interferon in either lymphocytes or macrophages. this toxin similarly inhibited the production of interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta) and il-1 alpha, but for the inhibition of the latter, 25-fold-less toxin was required than for inhibition of the former. inhibition of production of tnf was as sensitive as the il-1 alpha to exotoxin a. the effects of exotoxin a on lymphoproliferation and cytokine production could be neutralized by the addition of anti-exotoxin a antibodies. these results suggest that two mechanisms by which p. aeruginosa could contribute to the chronic bronchial infection-induced pathophysiology are the nonspecific stimulation of tnf and il-1 and the release of exotoxin a, a toxin which depresses immune responses.
[antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
[combined effects of arbekacin with other antibiotics against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. ii. the combined effect of arbekacin with imipenem or cefminox].
combined antibacterial effects of imipenem (ipm)+arbekacin (abk) and cefminox (cmnx)+abk against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were examined and the obtained results are summarized below. 1. either combination, ipm+abk or cmnx+abk, showed a strong antibacterial effect against mrsa when blood concentration of abk were sustained at mic as could be expected in clinical situations. while at sub mics of abk the antibacterial effect of these combination was slightly less than those of the previously reported combinations of abk and other antibiotics. 2. antibacterial effects of the combinations against mrsa were strongly dependent on the concentration of abk and less dependent on the concentration of ipm or cmnx. as were observed in the previously tested combinations of abk with other antibiotics, the antibacterial effect of the combination appeared to be highly dependent on the antibacterial activity and the concentration of abk. 3. as ipm has potent antibacterial activities against gram-negative bacteria (gnb) including pseudomonas aeruginosa while cmnx has potent antibacterial activities against gnb except p. aeruginosa, it is likely that the combinations of ipm+abk or cmnx+abk are useful for treatment of infections with mrsa together with gnb.
[combined effects of arbekacin with other antibiotics against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. i. the combined effect of arbekacin with fosfomycin or clavulanic acid/ticarcillin].
as arbekacin (abk) has a highly potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), its combined effects with fosfomycin (fom) and clavulanic acid/ticarcillin (cva/tipc) against mrsa were examined. the obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. against mrsa either combination, fom+abk or cva/tipc+abk showed a strong antibacterial effect at the mic or the sub mic of abk in the blood expected from clinical observations. the mic of abk by the combination use seemed to be equivalent to the mbc value. 2. effective concentrations of antibiotics in these combinations appeared to be strongly dependent on the effective concentration of abk and less dependent on that of fom or cva/tipc. therefore, the antibacterial activity of a combination seems to mostly depend on the antibacterial activity and the concentration of abk. 3. as fom and cva/tipc have antibacterial activities against pseudomonas aeruginosa, combinations of abk with these antibiotics are likely to be effective against double infection with p. aeruginosa in mrsa infected patients.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of the new antibiotic vermisporin.
the antimicrobial activity of vermisporin, a new antibiotic produced by fermentation of the fungus ophiobolus vermisporis, was tested in vitro. vermisporin inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. at 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-1 micrograms/ml). clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-2 micrograms/ml). vermisporin inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, at 0.5 micrograms/ml (range 0.12-0.5 micrograms/ml). vermisporin mics for group a, b, c, f and g streptococci were < 1 microgram/ml when tested in haemophilus test medium but > or = 8 micrograms/ml in the presence of blood. vermisporin mics for enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae exceeded 64 micrograms/ml. inhibited organisms had mbcs 16- to 32-fold above the mics.
[growth inhibitory activity of clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa against staphylococcus aureus (mrsa and mssa)].
anti staphylococcal activity by clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested by the reversed agar plate and the filter paper stamp methods. almost 40% of pseudomonas aeruginosa inhibited the growth of both methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa). green pigment (pyocyanin) produced strains showed a strong inhibitory effect against mrsa and mssa respectively. but some other pigment (yellow, red) strains also showed anti staphylococcal activity. these data suggest the colonization of pseudomonas aeruginosa with anti staphylococcal activity may not be eradicated by the anti pseudomonic antibiotics.
effects of cefaclor, cefetamet and ro 40-6890 on inflammatory responses of human  granulocytes.
the effect of three cephalosporins (cefetamet, cefaclor and ro 40-6890) upon human granulocytes and their ability to modulate the chemiluminescence response, phagocytose, kill bacteria and generate leukotrienes was studied. in the presence of the cephalosporins there was a significant increase in phagocytosis of escherichia coli. the bactericidal activity of human granulocytes for several other bacteria was also enhanced. cefetamet and cefaclor increased the chemiluminescence response of human neutrophils to pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis in contrast to ro 40-68790, which decreased the chemiluminescence response. the cephalosporins decreased the synthesis of leukotrienes from human neutrophils after stimulation with escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. these data emphasize the immunomodulatory functions of various cephalosporins on cells involved in host defence.
the in-vitro activity of new streptogramins, rp 59500, rp 57669 and rp 54476, alone and in combination.
rp 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of rp 57669 and rp 54476. the activity of rp 59500 and its two components against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. rp 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal to 1 mg/l (range 0.06-2 mg/l). both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of s. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group c and g streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l. streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/l. the mic90 was 4 mg/l for haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/l for moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59500 did not inhibit enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of rp 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were bacteroides spp. rp 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. mbcs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and s. aureus, compared with mbcs in broth, but rp 59500 was as active at ph 6 as at ph 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. rp 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.
in-vitro activity of tosufloxacin, a new quinolone antibacterial agent.
the in-vitro activity of tosufloxacin (a-61827) was compared with that of temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and selected members of other groups of antimicrobial agents, against 684 recent distinct clinical isolates and strains with known mechanisms of resistance. against members of the enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was slightly more active than tosufloxacin, which was more active than temafloxacin. the mic90 of tosufloxacin for all species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. was less than or equal to 1 mg/l. tosufloxacin was slightly more active than temafloxacin, and four to eight fold more active than ciprofloxacin, against the gram-positive species tested. the mic90 of tosufloxacin for staphylococcus aureus was 0.12 mg/l, and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 0.5 mg/l. all strains of neisseria spp., haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were inhibited by tosufloxacin at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l. tosufloxacin was the most active quinolone against the anaerobic organisms tested. cross resistance between quinolones was seen, but not between quinolones and other groups of antimicrobials. the protein binding of tosufloxacin across a range of concentrations averaged 60%. human serum at a concentration of 70% decreased the bactericidal activity of tosufloxacin by about four-fold.
in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.
in vitro and in vivo effect of antibiotics on catheters colonized by staphylococci.
an in vitro model was used to study whether and how catheter infections can be cured. silastic catheters were "infected" with staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and staphylococcus epidermidis kh11 and v2; these "infections" were then treated with 24, 48 and 96 h continuous infusions of various antimicrobial agents administered both as monotherapy and in combination. the staphylococcus aureus strain was considerably more difficult to eliminate from catheters than were the staphylococcus epidermidis strains. this experience gained in the laboratory was then applied in vivo to 16 episodes of catheter sepsis in seven children. treatment for at least six days with imipenem/cilastatin combined with fosfomycin or an aminoglycoside successfully eliminated the pathogens isolated from 11 of the 16 episodes of infection. the broad-spectrum combination was chosen because it could not be assumed that individual pathogens would be sensitive to a single substance. nine of the infected catheters could be retained in the patients. this experience suggests that it may be possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters by coagulase-negative staphylococci using the antimicrobial agents employed here.
studies on condensed-heterocyclic azolium cephalosporins. iii. synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[2-(2-amino-5-substituted-thiazol-4-yl)-2 (z)-alkoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(condensed-heterocyclic azolium)methyl-3-cephem-4- carboxylates.
as a part of our research on the synthesis of cephalosporins bearing condensed-heterocyclic azolium groups at the 3 position in the cephalosporin nucleus, we describe herein the synthesis of 7 beta-[2-(2-amino-5-halogeno-, methylthio-, methylsulfinyl-, methylsulfonyl- and sulfothiazol-4-yl)-2(z)-alkoxyiminoacetamido] cephalosporins and their antibacterial activity. among the compounds prepared, 7 beta-[2-(2-amino-5-chlorothiazol-4-yl)-2(z)- methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(imidazo[1,5-a]-pyridinium-1-yl)methyl-3-cephem -4-carboxylate (14) showed good antibacterial activity against both staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas the antibacterial activity against other gram-negative bacteria was a slightly lower than that of 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(z)-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(im ida zo [1,2-a]pyridinium (i-1) and imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium (i-4)-1-yl)methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylates.
in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
the in vitro activity of ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae and all aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was also active against acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. all group a and b streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. all methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the mic90 for staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus haemolyticus and enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; mic90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
in vitro evaluation of e1077, a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
e1077 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a wide spectrum of potent antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, e1077 was twice as active as cefpirome, with an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) of 0.78 micrograms/ml. methicillin-resistant s. aureus was moderately to highly resistant to e1077, but e1077 was at least twice as active as other beta-lactams tested. against enterococcus faecalis, e1077 was the most active of the cephalosporins tested (mic90, 12.5 micrograms/ml) and was at least fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml, e1077 inhibited 90% of streptococci and most of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, with the exceptions of serratia marcescens and proteus vulgaris, for which the mic90s of e1077 were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, e1077 was two- to fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. for the anaerobes, e1077 was as active against bacteroides fragilis as was cefuzonam, and its activity was fourfold higher than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. e1077 was at least as resistant as cefpirome to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases, and these enzymes had a low affinity for e1077.
antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
[antimicrobial and membranolytic activities of anti-burn drug fenozan].
fenozan, an anti-burn preparation, was shown to have antimicrobial activity against freshly isolated clinical strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis, as well as against collection strains of the other gram-positive bacteria. the antimicrobial action of the preparation was possibly due to impairment of permeability of the cytoplasmic membranes in the sensitive bacterial cells and their liberation of intracellular low molecular weight compounds to the environment. the membranolytic and minimum inhibitory concentrations of fenozan with respect to the sensitive bacterial cells were one order of magnitude lower than the concentration stabilizing the membranes of animal cells in the treatment of burns. combination of the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in fenozan was likely to provide its satisfactory therapeutic effect in the treatment of burn wounds.
[bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron in pediatrics].
we carried out bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp), a newly-developed carbapenem antibiotic, in pediatrics, and the following results were obtained: 1. when antibacterial activities of panipenem (papm) were determined, it was found that mics against such gram-positive cocci as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae and against such gram-negative rods as escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and branhamella catarrhalis were all sufficiently low. 2. papm showed better mic-correlated antibacterial activities against 215 subcultured strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) than imipenem. 3. clinical efficacies were evaluated to be excellent in 23 of 34 patients treated with papm/bp, excluding 3 patients from the efficacy evaluation. in addition, good responses were obtained in 10 patients but poor response in one, showing the overall efficacy rate of 97.1%. as for bacteriological efficacies, the eradication rate was also determined to be high, 92.6%. 4. as for side effects, rash appeared in 2 patients, and soft stool and diarrhea occurred in one each. the overall incidence of side effects was calculated to be 10.8%. as for abnormal laboratory findings, increases of eosinophiles in 4 patients, thrombocytes in 2, total bilirubin in 1, and got in 1 were observed. from these results, papm/bp was thought to be a highly useful drug in pediatrics.
pharmacokinetic disposition and bactericidal activities of cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone in serum and blister fluid.
cefepime is a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent gram-positive and gram-negative activity including activity against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. the pharmacokinetic disposition of cefepime is similar to that of ceftazidime. we compared the pharmacokinetic characteristics and the extent and duration of bactericidal activity in serum and suction-induced blister fluid after single 2-g intravenous doses of cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone given to healthy subjects. one clinical isolate each of e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus was used to assess bactericidal activity. results of the pharmacokinetic analysis were similar to previously reported data for these drugs. the high serum protein binding of cefoperazone (approximately 90%) contributed to poor blister fluid penetration. the other drugs penetrated well into this fluid compartment. cefepime showed significantly greater bactericidal activity in serum and blister fluid against e. cloacae than the other study drugs, ceftazidime was significantly better in serum and blister fluid against p. aeruginosa, and cefoperazone was significantly better against s. aureus only in serum. none of the study drugs had significant bactericidal activity in blister fluid against s. aureus. cefepime is a promising antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infections due to e. cloacae.
[a study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) is a combination drug of papm, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and bp, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1. its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. it was superior to imipenem (ipm) in the in vitro antibacterial activities against haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus including mrsa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. papm had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of ipm against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of ipm. the clinical usefulness of papm/bp was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. in terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of p. aeruginosa remained unchanged. six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. side-effects were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of s-got and s-gpt were found in 1 case. in conclusion, papm/bp is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.
resistance to ciprofloxacin of respiratory pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis.
objective: to determine the incidence of resistance to ciprofloxacin in respiratory pathogens isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) compared with that of isolates from patients without cf. the hypothesis was that repeated exposure of these respiratory pathogens to ciprofloxacin would reduce their sensitivity. design: isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus were obtained prospectively from sputa of patients with cf, as part of their routine care. the sensitivities of these isolates to ciprofloxacin were determined by standard agar dilution techniques. setting and patients: the study was carried out in patients who attended the outpatient clinic or were treated as inpatients of a tertiary referral hospital. sputa were obtained from 71 patients with cf (age range, 2-31 years) and isolates of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were compared with those from 54 hospital patients who did not have cf. outcome measures: sensitivities to ciprofloxacin, expressed as the minimal concentrations required to inhibit growth of the organisms (mic), were used to make comparisons between different isolates and the same isolates within patients at different times. results: a higher incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance was displayed by isolates of p. aeruginosa from cf patients who had been previously prescribed ciprofloxacin (mic50 of 2.0 mg/l and 4.0 mg/l for mucoid and non-mucoid strains respectively). the mic of individual organisms tended to rise after a course of ciprofloxacin had been given to their host. a much lower incidence of resistance was displayed by isolates of p. aeruginosa from patients without cf (mic50, 0.25 mg/l). similarly, s. aureus isolates from patients with cf exhibited greater resistance to ciprofloxacin (mic50, 32 mg/l) than isolates from other patients (mic50, 0.75 mg/l). conclusion: the resistance of p. aeruginosa appears to be related to ciprofloxacin exposure, so further development of resistance may be diminished by restricting the frequency of ciprofloxacin administration to individual patients.
bactericidal activities of rat defensins and synthetic rabbit defensins on staphylococci, klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid, 277, and 8n3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid strains), salmonella typhimurium (ra, rc, rd, and re of lps mutants) and escherichia coli.
rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. staphylococcus aureus (209p, cowan i, smith diffuse and smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus lysodeikticus and bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and k) and klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid, 277, and 8n3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (lps) of salmonella typhimurium lt2, such as ra, rc, rd, and re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. lysozyme did not show any bactericidal activity except against m. lysodeikticus and b. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against s. typhimurium and s. aureus. with regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, np1, np4, and np5, np1 showed strong bactericidal activity against k. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. neither np4 nor np5 showed any bactericidal activity, while np5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of np1 against k. pneumoniae 277.
antibacterial activity of the new quinolone ci-960 (pd 127391) against clinical isolates at a major tertiary care center in saudi arabia.
the antibacterial activity of the new fluoroquinolone ci-960 (pd 127391) was evaluated against 1,162 clinical isolates and compared with other quinolones and various commonly used antibiotics. ci-960 was highly effective against members of enterobacteriaceae inhibiting 626 of the 629 isolates at a less than or equal to 0.03 to 0.12 microgram/ml concentration. all the 305 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomona maltophilia, and acinetobacter were susceptible to ci-960. it was the only effective drug against 10 multi-resistant isolates of pseudomonads and acinetobacter. all staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03-0.5 microgram/ml of ci-960. like other drugs of its class, it had little activity against enterococci.
[activation of the resident microbial flora as a possibility for the improvement  of humoral antibody potentials].
the effect of a parenteral application of an adjuvant (propionibacterium acnes) and an adjuvant/antigen combination (staphylococcus aureus cowan i/al(oh)3, pseudomonas aeruginosa/al(oh)3 respectively, was tested with regard to the improvement of antibacterial resistance. parameter was the humoral antibody production (igg) of rabbits against six facultative pathogen bacterial species (st. aureus, sc. faecium, bac. cereus, p. multocida, e. coli, ps. aeruginosa) and against sheep rod blood cell membranes. the three methods of treatment led to a significant enhancement of igg-antibodies against the particular homologous antigen. in addition to this specific reaction the application of adjuvant/antigen combinations provoked a significant enhancement of antibodies also against heterologous antigens (p. multocida, bac. cereus, sheep red blood cell membranes). the application of p. acnes had no distinct effect on the antibody titer against the different antigen preparations. in order to analyse the immune response qualitatively, a greater part of serum samples was examined by immuno blot technique. the number of partial antigens recognized by the sera increased during the experiments but the rise did generally not relate to developments of antibody titers. nevertheless, the ps. aeruginosa/al(oh)3-treatment seemed to improve the ability of sera to detect antigenic determinants of heterologous bacterial species.
antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.
major trends in the microbial etiology of nosocomial infection.
to determine trends in the microbial etiology of nosocomial infections in the 1980s, surveillance data on the microbiology of documented nosocomial infection reported to the national nosocomial infections surveillance system and from the university of michigan hospital were analyzed. antimicrobial susceptibility data on selected pathogens from both sources were also reviewed. overall, escherichia coli decreased from 23% of infections in 1980 to 16% in 1986-1989, klebsiella pneumoniae dropped from 7% to 5%, whereas coagulase negative staphylococci increased from 4% to 9% and candida albicans increased from 2% to 5%. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter species and enterococci had minor increases, but antimicrobial resistant strains for these pathogens as well as coagulase-negative staphylococci were seen more frequently. in contrast to the 1970s, major shifts in the etiology of nosocomial infection have occurred in the decade of the 1980s. taken as a whole, the shifts are away from more easily treated pathogens toward more resistant pathogens with fewer options for therapy. these shifts underscore the continued need for prevention and control to accompany new developments in therapy.
antiseptic effectiveness with fibroblast preservation.
the efficacy of topical antiseptic therapy for wounds and skin ulcers has been shown to be at the expense of fibroblast and leukocyte function and, in general, wound healing. specifically, continued fibroblast function after exposure to antiseptics has been correlated to the concentration of the antiseptic. at concentrations that preserve fibroblast function, 0.005% sodium hypochlorite, 0.001% providone-iodine, 0.0025% acetic acid, and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide were tested for their effectiveness against various clinical isolates. staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, group d enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis were exposed to the antiseptics and plated in a standard microbiological fashion. the cultures showed that sodium hypochlorite inhibited the growth of all the bacteria (p less than 0.001), whereas povidone-iodine reduced the colonies of s. aureus and acetic acid inhibited p. aeruginosa. our study suggests that 0.005% sodium hypochlorite can be used as a debriding and topical antibacterial agent for wounds and skin ulcers without inhibiting fibroblast activity essential to normal wound repair.
the effects of fibronectin on the adherence of bacteria to corneal epithelium.
the aim of our experiments was to determine whether treatment with topical fibronectin led to increased adherence of staphylococcus aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa to rabbit corneas with epithelial defects. no significant effect of fibronectin was demonstrated. for all strains of s. aureus tested, the number of recoverable organisms was decreased at 24 h compared to 1 h. none of the rabbits developed infectious keratitis.
in vitro activity of cefpodoxime and ten other cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, including beta-lactamase producers.
cefpodoxime, the deesterified part of the orally available cefpodoxime proxetil,  is active against most enterobacteriaceae with mic50 of 0.06 to 2 mg/l. only enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains show mic50 of 4 mg/l. coagulase negative staphylococci have a mic50 of 2, while staphylococcus aureus strains have a mic of 4 mg/l. in comparison to other orally available cephalosporins cefpodoxime is slightly less active than cefixime and cefotiam against gram-negative bacteria but more active than cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin. against staphylococci the activity of cefpodoxime is comparable to that of cefotiam and cefuroxime and superior to cefaclor and cephalexin, while cefixime does not have sufficient activity against these species. like all cephalosporins cefpodoxime has no activity against enterococci.
[antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide to fresh clinical isolates].
in the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (cpm), its minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. microbial strains in which no cpm-resistant strains emerged were streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. 2. in comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to cpm were staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to cpm was observed in high ratios. 3. among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that cpm could not exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "cpm-resistant strains". 4. it was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including cpm. 5. there are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of cpm to clinically isolated strains in recent years. however, it was jointly confirmed that cpm maintained effective antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. furthermore, when it was additionally considered that cpm was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that cpm was one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.
in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of sr 44337, a new long acting cephalosporin.
the in-vitro activity of sr 44337 was compared with that of other broad-spectrum  parenteral cephalosporins, plus imipenem and co-amoxiclav. sr 44337 showed good activity against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic90s of less than 0.5 mg/l against all species tested, with the exception of citrobacter spp. (mic90 2 mg/l) and serratia spp. (mic90 4 mg/l). of the agents tested, only ceftriaxone showed consistently greater activity against this family of organisms. sr 44337 had higher activity than ceftriaxone against acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was the most active agent tested against neisseria meningitidis (mic90 0.004 mg/l). all strains of n. gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and the streptococci (excluding the enterococci) were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l of sr 44337, which was also the most active cephalosporin tested against staphylococcus aureus. sr 44337 was stable to hydrolysis by the tem-1, shv-1 and p99 beta-lactamases, and was more stable than ceftriaxone to the k-1 beta-lactamase.
in vitro activity of the novel cephalosporin gr69153.
the in vitro activity of gr69153 was compared to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and gentamicin against a total of 702 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(8) cfu) were used throughout. gr69153 inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and proteus mirabilis at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and 90% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. citrobacter freundii (mic90 16 mg/l), morganella morganii (mic90 128 mg/l) and enterobacter spp. (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l) were considerably more resistant to gr69153. gr69153 was four-fold more active than ceftazidime against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus but was inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis group.
in vitro activity of ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
the in vitro activity of ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, e-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. ro 09-1428 inhibited group a streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group b, c and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for staphylococcus aureus ro 09-1428 had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and e-1040. against pseudomonas aeruginosa ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml, and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, providencia, salmonella and shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. for most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae ro 09-1428 had higher mics of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. anaerobes, enterococci and listeria monocytogenes were resistant to ro 09-1428. ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-2, staphylococcus aureus pc-1, moraxella catarrhalis bro-1, enterobacter p-99, pseudomonas aeruginosa sabath-abraham or klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-7 and tem-9. ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid ph.
pharmacological properties of moringa oleifera. 1: preliminary screening for antimicrobial activity.
the antimicrobial activities of moringa oleifera leaves, roots, bark and seeds were investigated in vitro against bacteria, yeast, dermatophytes and helminths pathogenic to man. by a disk-diffusion method, it was demonstrated that the fresh leaf juice and aqueous extracts from the seeds inhibit the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and that extraction temperatures above 56 degrees c inhibited this activity. no activity was demonstrated against four other pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and candida albicans. by a dilution method, no activity was demonstrated against six pathogenic dermatophytes. a method was standardized for studying the effect of aqueous extracts on ascaris lumbricoides eggs, but no activity was exhibited by any part of the tree in contrast to chenopodium ambrosioides leaf extracts.
an analysis of ten-year trends in infections in adults on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd).
infectious complications are the achilles heel of capd. to determine trends in these events, we analyzed the capd related infections of 303 adults on capd at a single university center between 1979 and 1989. during this decade the percentage of insulin-dependent diabetics increased from 14% to 39% (p less than 0.005). peritonitis rates fell from 2.4 episodes/y in 1979 to 0.8 episodes/y in 1989. the proportion of patients with multiple episodes of peritonitis decreased (40% of the patients in 1979-1982 vs 15% in 1983-1989, p = 0.0001) while the proportion of patients with no episodes of peritonitis increased during the same periods (29% vs 49%, p = 0.005). the proportion of peritonitis episodes due to s. aureus rose over the 10-year period (p = 0.005), while those due to s. epidermidis decreased (p less than 0.10). the overall incidence of s. aureus peritonitis remained unchanged. catheter infection rates initially increased and then fell during the decade; s. aureus remained the predominant cause. the proportion of peritonitis episodes associated with catheter infection rose (13% in 1982 vs 24% in 1989, p = 0.025), and in 1989, 80% of these episodes were caused by s. aureus. catheter loss was also primarily due to s. aureus infections in 1989 (80%). infections due to p. aeruginosa were a persistent problem. the proportion of patients transferring to hemodialysis each year paralleled catheter loss rates, which in turn appeared to be more related to catheter infection rates than to peritonitis rates. we conclude that control of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa will be the key to future reductions in the infectious complications of capd patients.
synthesis and antimicrobial activities of some new tetrahydro-2h-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione derivatives of cefadroxil.
eleven new 7-[2-(dihydro-5-substituted-6-thioxo-2h-1,3,5-thiadiazine-3( 4h)-yl)-2- (4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-3-methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid derivatives were synthesized by the reaction of cefadroxil monohydrate, formaldehyde and substituted potassium dithiocarbamate. their structures have been elucidated by spectral data and elementary analysis. the title compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity in vitro against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and yeast-like fungi (candida albicans, c. parapsilosis, c. stellatoidea, c. pseudotropicalis) in comparison with cefadroxil monohydrate. the activity of compounds 1 and 10 against s. aureus (mbc: 37.5 micrograms/ml) and compound 1 against e. coli (mbc: 75 micrograms/ml) were found to be the same as cefadroxil monohydrate. compounds 1 and 10 were more effective than cefadroxil monohydrate against s. faecalis with 25 and 37.5 micrograms/ml mbc values, respectively. none of the compounds and cefadroxil monohydrate proved to be effective against p. aeruginosa (mbc: greater than 100 micrograms/ml). while cefadroxil monohydrate had no activity against yeast-like fungi, compounds 9 and 10 were significantly effective against yeast-like fungi (mfc: 37.5 micrograms/ml).
in-vitro activity of win 57273 compared to the activity of other fluoroquinolones and two beta-lactam antibiotics.
win 57273, a new fluoroquinolone, was four to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. the mic90 for staphylococcus aureus was 0.015 mg/l and for s. epidermidis, 0.03 mg/l. all lancefield group a, b, c, & g streptococci, streptococcus bovis and s. pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l compared to 0.5 mg/l for tosufloxacin and 2 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. for anaerobic bacteria win 57273 had an mic90 for bacteroides of 1 mg/l, and for clostridium spp. 0.015.mg/l. win 57273 was less active than ciprofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic90 of 1 mg/l, including aminoglycoside and cephalosporin-resistant isolates. the mic90 of win 57273 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 mg/l, compared to 0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and legionella spp. were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l. win 57273 was more active against gram-negative bacteria at acid ph, but activity was decreased by magnesium ions and an increase in inoculum. resistant strains were selected after passage on antibiotic-containing agar.
tracheal antimicrobial peptide, a cysteine-rich peptide from mammalian tracheal mucosa: peptide isolation and cloning of a cdna.
extracts of the bovine tracheal mucosa have an abundant peptide with potent antimicrobial activity. the 38-amino acid peptide, which we have named tracheal antimicrobial peptide (tap), was isolated by a sequential use of size-exclusion, ion-exchange, and reverse-phase chromatographic fractionations using antimicrobial activity as a functional assay. the yield was approximately 2 micrograms/g of wet mucosa. the complete peptide sequence was determined by a combination of peptide and cdna analysis. the amino acid sequence of tap is h-asn-pro-val-ser-cys-val-arg-asn-lys-gly-ile-cys-val-pro-ile-arg-cys-pr o- gly-ser-met-lys-gln-ile-gly-thr-cys-val-gly-arg-ala-val-lys-cys-cys-arg- lys-lys - oh. mass spectral analysis of the isolated peptide was consistent with this sequence and indicated the participation of six cysteine residues in the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds. the size, basic charge, and presence of three intramolecular disulfide bonds is similar to, but clearly distinct from, the defensins, a well-characterized class of antimicrobial peptides from mammalian circulating phagocytic cells. the putative tap precursor is predicted to be relatively small (64 amino acids), and the mature peptide resides at the extreme carboxyl terminus and is bracketed by a short putative propeptide region and an inframe stop codon. the mrna encoding this peptide is more abundant in the respiratory mucosa than in whole lung tissue. the purified peptide had antibacterial activity in vitro against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumonia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, the peptide was active against candida albicans, indicating a broad spectrum of activity. this peptide appears to be, based on structure and activity, a member of a group of cysteine-rich, cationic, antimicrobial peptides found in animals, insects, and plants. the isolation of tap from the mammalian respiratory mucosa may provide insight into our understanding of host defense of this vital tissue.
in vitro activities of sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and fleroxacin.
the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin was compared with those of tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and fleroxacin against 730 bacterial isolates representing 49 different species. sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin had similar spectra of activity, but sparfloxacin was less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and more active against many gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. tosufloxacin mics were generally 8- to 16-fold lower than those for sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. all four fluoroquinolones were active against nalidixic acid-susceptible strains of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic for 90% of the isolates [mic90], less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml) but nalidixic acid-resistant strains were less susceptible (mic90, greater than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml). against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, mic90s were 1.0 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 2.0 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin, and 4.0 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin. against enterococcus faecalis, sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin mic90s were 1.0 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. mic90s for ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus were 0.016 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 0.06 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin, and 0.5 micrograms/ml for both ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin. with four species of gram-negative bacilli, mutants resistant to two to four times the sparfloxacin mic occurred spontaneously at frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-9): single-step high-level resistance was not observed. in vitro-selected sparfloxacin-resistant mutants displayed cross-resistance to other quinolones, as did clinical isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus. tosufloxacin mics with broth microdilution methods were four- to eightfold greater than those obtained with agar dilution methods. the two procedures gave comparable results when sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin was being tested.
[in vitro antibacterial activity of piperacillin-tazobactam combination on hospital isolates and regression curve].
minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of piperacillin (p) in combination with  4 micrograms/ml of tazobactam (t) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,245 strains isolated in 4 hospitals. in addition antibiograms by agar diffusion were performed with disks loaded of 75 micrograms of p + 10 micrograms of t. for naturally non beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae (e), mic 50 and 90% of p + t were (microgram/ml): e. coli 1-2; p. mirabilis: 0.5-1; activity was practically identical on plasmid mediated penicillinase (pase) producing strains. strains of k. pneumoniae only resistant (r) to amino- and carboxypenicillins (c) had mics less than or equal to 4 (mode mic 2); mics of strains r to cephalothin and/or cefotaxime were 2 to 16 (mode mic 4). for chromosomal cephalosporinase (case) producing species, mics of p + t were less than or equal to 8, including for acquired pase producing strains, but were greater than or equal to 16 for case hyperproducing strains. strains of p. aeruginosa susceptible (s) to c were inhibited by 1 to 16 (with mic 4) and strains r to c by 8 to greater than 128. mics were generally 2 to 32 for a. baumannii s to c at 0.12 to greater than 128 for strains r to c. haemophilus, s or r to ampicillin, were inhibited by 0.008 to 2 (mic 50 and 90: 0.016-0.12). s. aureus s to methicillin (m), pase producing on not, were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 (mode mic 1) and strains r to m by 8 to greater than 128. activity of p + t for coagulase-staphylococci was similar.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
[antibacterial and therapeutic effectiveness of a pectin from sea grass zostera].
the kinetics of the antibacterial activity of zosterin, a polysaccharide preparation of a sea grass belonging to zoster, was studied. by its chemical structure zosterin is a low ++methoxylated pectin. in vitro the preparation markedly inhibited the growth of ++gram-negative and ++gram-positive organisms: s. aureus, e. coli, y. pseudotuberculosis, s. typhimurium and ps. aeruginosa. on a model of experimental pseudotuberculosis++ infection caused by oral contamination of mice f1 (cba x c57b1) with a suspension of y. pseudotuberculosis zosterin was shown to have a therapeutic effect. it protected 30 to 40 per cent of the animals when administered per os simultaneously with or 24 hours after the contamination. the results are in favour of the zosterin further investigation as a preparation useful in prevention of intestinal infections in persons being in contact with the patients.
in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.
interaction between pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus: description of an anti-staphylococcal substance.
the presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum of 191 patients with cystic  fibrosis was significantly related (p less than 0.0001) to the absence of staphylococcus aureus. cross-streaking tests showed that 40 of 50 clinical strains of p. aeruginosa produced substances that inhibited the growth of s. aureus. when incorporated into agar plates, this antibacterial substance(s) inhibited the growth of 177 of 189 strains of nine staphylococcal species, all of 16 methicillin-resistant s. aureus and 27 of 39 strains of six other gram-positive genera. the substance(s) did not inhibit 23 strains of seven gram-negative genera tested. the antibacterial activity was heat stable and could be extracted into chloroform; activity was retained on sephadex g-15 (v/vo approximately 2, mr less than 500) and eluted as a single peak from high performance liquid chromatography, well separated from pseudomonic acid, pyocyanin and a number of other phenazines.
[sodium sulfapyridazine in new delayed-action bases for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis].
possible preparation of 10 per cent sodium sulfapyridazine ophthalmic drops containing aubazidan, a microbial polysaccharide, providing prolongation of the drops action and stability on the storage was studied. the pharmacokinetic studies showed that aubazidan which is a natural polymer provided high prolongation of the sulfapyridazine effect in the tissues of the anterior part of the eye in rabbits. the prolonged effect was similar to the previously observed effect of the solutions containing synthetic polymers such as 1 per cent polyacrylamide and polyvinyl . satisfactory tolerance by the rabbit eye tissues of 6-fold daily instillations of the 10 per cent sodium sulfapyridazine solution with aubazidan for the observation period of 1 month was stated. when stored in vials the 10 per cent sodium sulfapyridazine ophthalmic drops with 0.5 per cent of aubazidan preserved the stability for 24 months with respect to the colour, transparency, viscosity, ph and drug content. it was demonstrated with using the agar diffusion method and staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa as the test cultures that sodium sulfapyridazine completely preserved its antimicrobial activity in the presence of aubazidan. the data suggested that clinical trials of the 10 per cent sodium sulfapyridazine solution with 0.2-0.5 per cent of aubazidan were promising in prevention and therapy of bacterial conjunctivitis.
[clinical evaluation of cefpirome in pediatrics and a study on the penetration into cerebrospinal fluid].
cefpirome (cpr, hr 810), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (csf), and its clinical efficacy against bacterial infections. 1. csf concentrations of cpr following intravenous injection was investigated in 2 patients with purulent meningitis. in one of them, the concentrations were 2.11 micrograms/ml and 1.31 micrograms/ml on 3 and 8 days, respectively, after start of administration. in the other patient, they were 24.2 micrograms/ml, and 1.35 micrograms/ml on 2 days and 7 days after administration, respectively. 2. antibacterial activities of cpr against clinical isolates, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, except those against pseudomonas aeruginosa, were clearly superior to those of ceftazidime. 3. clinical efficacies evaluated in 15 patients were "excellent" in 9, "good" in 5 and "unknown" in 1. the overall efficacy rate was 93.0%. 4. clinical efficacies were "excellent" in 1 patient with bacteremia, "excellent" in 6 and "good" in one of 7 patients with pneumonia, and "good" in both of the 2 patients with purulent meningitis. clinical efficacies against other diseases were "excellent" or "good", in 1 patient with pyothorax, 1 patient with purulent lymphadenitis, and 2 patients with facial cellulitis. in 1 patient with biliary tract infection, the results of treatment with cpr were "unknown" due to insufficient clinical data. 5. no adverse reactions were observed except in 1 patient who showed an increase in platelet count.
in vitro activity of sparfloxacin.
sparfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, inhibited the majority of members of the family enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. it was less active than ciprofloxacin but more active than ofloxacin. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was less active than ciprofloxacin but twofold more active than ofloxacin. it inhibited staphylococcus aureus and most streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes isolates at 0.25 micrograms/ml, whereas ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin inhibited these isolates at 2 micrograms/ml. bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. sparfloxacin was less active at an acidic ph and in the presence of mg2+. resistance to sparfloxacin was produced by repeated exposure, although the frequency of single-step mutants was less than 10(-9).
[antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp. against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
effect of hydrogen peroxide on growth of candida, cryptococcus, and other yeasts  in simulated blood culture bottles.
the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood contained in liquid culture medium increased the dissolved-o2 partial pressure in direct proportion to the volume injected. the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the growth of subcultured clinical isolates of candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans, torulopsis glabrata, and other yeasts and on the growth of blood culture isolates of representative pathogenic bacteria was compared with its effect on their growth in vented and unvented stationary bottles. c. albicans and c. neoformans grew significantly better in bottles to which hydrogen peroxide had been added than in vented or unvented bottles. the advantage of hydrogen peroxide over venting was most marked with several slowly growing strains. similar results were obtained in shaker cultures with strains of c. albicans which were inoculated directly from positive blood cultures. the effect of hydrogen peroxide tended to diminish during serial passage. t. glabrata grew less well when hydrogen peroxide was added, perhaps because of the absence of oxidase. the growth of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis was not significantly inhibited or augmented by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. the growth of escherichia coli was inhibited slightly. the value of the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood cultures to improve the isolation of yeasts needs to be established by a clinical trial which would compare this method with established methods.
bactericidal activity of human peritoneal macrophages from patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
peritoneal macrophages (pm) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of bacterial peritonitis, the main complication of peritoneal dialysis (pd). we determined the antibacterial activity of pm from 31 pd patients using gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) test organisms. in an 8-hour test assay, pm revealed the highest antibacterial activity against e. coli [median bactericidal index (bi) = 5.46 representing 0.74 log growth inhibition compared to controls] and the lowest against p. aeruginosa (bi = 1.63, 0.21 log growth inhibition, p less than 0.05). the antibacterial activity against s. aureus (bi = 1.99, 0.3 log growth inhibition) and s. epidermidis (bi = 2.0, 0.31 log growth inhibition) was within this range. when compared to peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes, pm reached only 4% (s. aureus) and 8.1% (e. coli) of their antibacterial activity (p less than 0.05). using e. coli as a test organism, pm isolated after a 4-hour dialysis period revealed the highest antibacterial activity when compared to pm isolated after longer dialysis periods (p less than 0.05). increasing the duration of pd to 6 and 8 h subsequently decreased the antibacterial activity of pm, suggesting that unphysiologic concentrations of toxic metabolites in the peritoneal effluent might have a harmful influence on pm functions.
antibacterial activities in vitro and in vivo and pharmacokinetics of cefquinome  (hr 111v), a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
cefquinome is a new injectable aminothiazolyl cephalosporin derivative. it is stable against chromosomally and plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases and has a broad antibacterial spectrum. staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and members of the family enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, salmonella spp., klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., and serratia marcescens) are inhibited at low concentrations. cefquinome is also active against many strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. its in vitro activity against gram-negative anaerobes is very limited. the high in vitro activity of cefquinome is reflected by its high in vivo efficacy against experimental septicemia due to different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. we studied the pharmacokinetic properties of cefquinome in mice, dogs, pigs, and calves. after single parenteral administrations, cefquinome displayed high peak levels, declining with half-lives of about 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.3 h, respectively. the areas under the concentration-time curve determined for dogs and mice showed linear correlations to the given doses. in dogs the urinary recovery was more than 70% within 24 h of dosing.
[effects of disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (na2edta) and tetracyclines on drug resistant bacteria. studies in vitro].
an effect of na2edta and tetracycline (oxytetracycline and doxycycline) resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens. the tests were performed in vitro by serial dilutions of the drugs in liquid medium. mic for na2edta, tetracyclines and a combination of na2edta and tetracyclines was determined. it was shown that the combination of oxytetracycline or doxycycline with na2edta caused changes in sensitivity of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to these antibiotics. after an application of the mixture of various concentrations of tetracycline and na2edta it was observed that, with the reduction of the effective na2edta dose by about half, the lowest concentrations of tetracyclines inhibiting the growth of resistant bacteria were 2-64 times lower than mic values of antibiotics without na2edta.
interpretive criteria of antimicrobial disk susceptibility tests with flomoxef.
320 recently isolated pathogens, 20 strains from each of 16 species, were investigated using mueller-hinton agar and din as well as nccls standards. the geometric mean of the agar dilution mics of flomoxef were 0.44 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 0.05 mg/l (klebsiella oxytoca) to 12.6 mg/l (enterobacter spp.) for enterobacteriaceae, 33.1 mg/l for acinetobacter anitratus, 64 mg/l for enterococcus faecalis, and more than 256 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa. for disk susceptibility testing of flomoxef a 30 micrograms disk loading and the following interpretation of inhibition zones using the din method were recommended: resistant-up to 22 mm (corresponding to mics of 8 mg/l or more), moderately susceptible-23 to 29 mm (corresponding to mics from 1 to 4 mg/l), and susceptible-30 mm or more (corresponding to mics of 0.5 mg/l or less). the respective values for the nccls method using the american high mic breakpoints are: resistant--up to 14 mm (corresponding to mics of 32 mg/l or more), moderately susceptible--15 to 17 mm (corresponding to mics of 16 mg/l), and susceptible--18 mm or more (corresponding to mics of 8 mg/l or less).
new quaternary ammonium polymers as antimicrobial agents. part ii. alkylation products of linear aliphatic poly (aminodisulphides).
two new polymeric disulphides containing t-amino groups in their main chain, namely poly[1,8-(3,6-dimethyl-3,6-diaza) octaine diyl disulphide] (5) and poly[1,8-(1,12-(3-10-dimethyl-3,10-diaza) dodecane diyl disulphide] (6) were prepared by the polyoxidation of 3,6-dimethyl-3,6-diazaoctane-1,8-dithiol (3) and 3,10-dimethyl-3,10-diazadodecane-1,12-dithiol (4), respectively. they were quaternized with methyl iodide and benzyl bromide, and the resulting quaternary ammonium polymers were preliminarily tested for antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli k12, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. all the quaternized products showed interesting killing potency against p. aeruginosa. the benzylated products, besides being more active against p. aeruginosa, showed fair activity also against the other bacterial strains tested.
in vitro activity and stability against novel beta-lactamases of investigational  beta-lactams (cefepime, cefpirome, flomoxef, sce2787 and piperacillin plus tazobactam) in comparison with established compounds (cefotaxime, latamoxef and piperacillin).
the therapeutic perspectives of flomoxef, sce 2787, cefpirome, cefepime, latamoxef, cefotaxime and of piperacillin plus tazobactam were comparatively evaluated by their in vitro activity against 1119 clinical isolates of 83 bacterial species. escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. enterobacter sakazakii, proteus spp. and shigella spp. were about equally susceptible to the cephalosporins (mic90: 0.06 to 0.5 mg/l), while the mic90 for piperacillin plus tazobactam was between 2 and 16 mg/l. enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and serratia spp. were most susceptible to sce 2787, cefpirome and cefepime (mic90: 0.06 to 2 mg/l) followed by latamoxef, cefotaxime, flomoxef and piperacillin plus tazobactam. for citrobacter spp., providencia spp. and yersinia enterocolitica mic90 were between 0.06 and 0.5 mg/l. flomoxef was between 2 to 4 log2 less active against these species but more active than piperacillin plus tazobactam (mic90: 2 and 8 mg/l). morganella morganii and hafnia alvei were most susceptible to cefepime, cefpirome and latamoxef (mic90: 0.13 to 0.5 mg/l) while cefotaxime (mic90: 8 mg/l) and piperacillin plus tazobactam (mic90: 8 and greater than 64 mg/l) were the least active compounds. sce 2787, cefepime and cefpirome were the most potent beta-lactams against the majority of the 13 species of non-fermentative bacilli (nfb) investigated (mic90: 0.5 to 16 mg/l). the oxacephems were the least active compounds against nfb. cefepime was the most active of the compounds included against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90: 16 mg/l). haemophilus spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae and bordetella pertussis were most susceptible to cefotaxime (mic90: 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l). latamoxef had the lowest activity of all compounds against gram-positive cocci. flomoxef was the most active compound against penicillinase producing staphylococcus aureus and about equally active as the other betalactams against methicillin susceptible staphylococci of other staphylococcal species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities of quinolones in combination with clindamycin, metronidazole, and ornidazole.
to enhance the antimicrobial spectrum of the quinolones against anaerobic organisms and gram-positive bacteria, we investigated in two studies the parenteral combinations of ciprofloxacin (200 mg) and ofloxacin (200 mg) with metronidazole (500 mg) or clindamycin (600 mg) and the oral combinations of enoxacin (400 mg) and fleroxacin (400 mg) with metronidazole (400 mg), clindamycin (300 mg), or ornidazole (500 mg) (only with fleroxacin). the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities (sbas) against 5 aerobic and 2 anaerobic species (total, 58 strains) were determined in two groups of 10 healthy volunteers by using a randomized crossover study design. the additions of metronidazole, clindamycin, and ornidazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the quinolones. the combination of clindamycin with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and, to a lesser extent, fleroxacin resulted in an increase of the sba against gram-positive strains (mean peak titers): staphylococcus aureus, ciprofloxacin alone, 1:5.5; ciprofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:19.9; ofloxacin alone, 1:3.6; ofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:17.5; fleroxacin alone, 1:4.3; fleroxacin-clindamycin, 1:8.1; streptococcus pneumoniae (fleroxacin and enoxacin were not tested), ciprofloxacin alone, 1:2.0; ciprofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:53; ofloxacin alone, 1:2.6; and ofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:49.2. the high sba of quinolones against gram-negative bacteria was not affected by the combinations; however, relatively low activities against pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected. in general, against anaerobic bacteria, low bactericidal activities were determined in both studies (mean peak titers ranged from 1:2.1 to 1:3.1; mean trough titers range from 1:2.0 to 1:2.9). in clinical settings with severe mixed infections, a parenteral therapy consisting of modern quinolones together with clindamycin or imidazole derivatives seems to be active and offers no obvious interactions.
[studies on the sub-mic of beta-lactam antibiotics--bactericidal activity in compromised host's serum].
bactericidal activity in compromised host's serum i.e. patients with cancer, the  elderly, diabetes, was stronger than that in normal serum against proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis) but was weaker against klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae). against escherichia coli (e. coli), bactericidal activity on serum of patients with cancer was weaker in the following order, that in elderly serum, that in diabetic serum. against proteus vulgaris (p. vulgaris), bactericidal activity in elderly serum was similar to that in normal serum but was stronger than that in serum of patients with cancer. against pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), bactericidal activity in elderly serum and diabetic serum was similar to that in normal serum but was weaker than that in serum of patients with cancer. piperacillin showed bactericidal activity in nutrient broth, normal serum and compromised host's serum at a concentration of 1/4 mic against e. coli, p. mirabilis and p. aeruginosa. aspoxicillin showed bactericidal activity in nutrient broth, and bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity in normal serum and serum of patients with cancer against e. coli and p. aeruginosa. while cefazolin and cefmetazole slightly inhibited the growth of bacteria in nutrient broth, they showed hardly any bactericidal activity in normal serum and compromised host's serum.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
[susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
in vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. the results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. imipenem (ipm) showed potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae. 2. ipm had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated enterobacteriaceae, that is, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus spp. 3. ipm showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter anitratus but not against xanthomonas maltophilia.
synthesis and antimicrobial activities of some new tetrahydro-2h-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione derivatives of cephalexin.
in this study, compounds with a 7-[2-(dihydro-5-substituted 6-thioxo-2h-1,3,5-thiadiazine-3[4h]-yl)-2-phenyl]acetamido-3 -methyl-3- cephem-4-carboxylic acid structure were synthesized by reacting cephalexin monohydrate with formaldehyde and dithiocarbamic acid salts prepared from some primary amines. the structure of the compounds was confirmed by spectral data and elementary analysis. the antimicrobial activities of the compounds were investigated against some bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and some candida sp. (c. albicans, c. parapsilosis, c. stellatoidea and c. pseudotropicalis) by using tube dilution method. in microbiological studies, cephalexin monohydrate was used as reference standard. both compounds were synthesized and cephalexin monohydrate was found ineffective against s. faecalis and p. aeruginosa in the concentrations studied. while most of the compounds showed bacteriostatic activity against s. aureus, compounds 1, 3 and 7 showed the same activity against e. coli. on the other hand, compound 3, 5, 6, 7 and 10 showed anticandidal activity, whereas cephalexin monohydrate was not active against any candida sp. compound 11 was found effective against c. stellatoidea and c. pseudotropicalis.
in vitro activity of tosufloxacin, a new quinolone, against respiratory pathogens derived from cystic fibrosis sputum.
by using broth microdilution methods, the in vitro activity of tosufloxacin (a-64730), a new quinolone, was compared with those of other agents, including five quinolones, against geographically diverse cystic fibrosis sputum isolates obtained from 26 cystic fibrosis centers in the united states. these included pseudomonas aeruginosa, conventional as well as especially resistant (ceftazidime, aztreonam, gentamicin, and/or tobramycin) isolates: escherichia coli; pseudomonas cepacia; staphylococcus aureus; and haemophilus influenzae. tosufloxacin mics for 50 and 90% of isolates of standard p. aeruginosa were 0.5 and 2.0 mg/liter, for resistant p. aeruginosa they were 4.0 and greater than 16.0 mg/liter, for e. coli they were less than or equal to 0.016 mg/liter, for p. cepacia they were 4.0 and 8.0 mg/liter, for s. aureus they were 0.063 and 0.063 mg/liter, and for h. influenzae they were less than or equal to 0.016 and 0.032 mg/liter, respectively. tosufloxacin activities against standard and resistant strains of p. aeruginosa were similar to those of comparative quinolones. against e. coli, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of other quinolones. against s. aureus, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cephalexin, but tosufloxacin was more active than other agents. against h. influenzae, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of other quinolones. there was minor diminution of activity at ph 8.2 but major diminution of activity at ph 5.2 and at inoculum sizes of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu/ml. activity was unaffected by sputum but was enhanced by serum and by the omission of cation supplementation. tosufloxacin has consistent activity against common cystic fibrosis pathogens. its high degree of activity against s. aureus with activity maintained against p. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria of interest suggests that further in vitro studies and assessment of activity in in vivo models of cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections are warranted.
pefloxacin therapy for nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit.
nosocomial infections occurring in an intensive care unit (icu) are commonly caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli or staphylococcus aureus, which are frequently multi-resistant and difficult to treat and contribute significantly to the patients' morbidity in the icu. pefloxacin, with its wide range of antimicrobial activity, lack of serious side-effects and advantageous kinetics, is a useful drug for use in this group of critically ill patients. pefloxacin has achieved a greater than 70% clinical cure rate and a microbiological response of over 80% in cases of nosocomial pneumonia in the icu. failure and superinfection has occurred with the development of resistance, particularly in pseudomonas aeruginosa in a small number of cases, but this can be prevented by combination antimicrobial therapy. serious side-effects, including confusion, psychiatric disturbance and other neurological abnormalities were rare and resolved on withdrawal of the drug. drug interactions occur with cimetidine and theophylline but are usually not clinically relevant; significant interaction with warfarin occurs and the dose of warfarin needs careful adjustment. pefloxacin is a valuable drug for use in bacteriologically proven sensitive infections and combination with aminoglycosides or beta-lactam agents should prevent the development of resistance.
[antimicrobial activities of gentamicin against fresh clinical isolates].
antimicrobial activities of gentamicin (gm), compared with activities of other aminoglycosides (ags) and beta-lactam antibiotics, were studied against clinical isolates obtained during a period of july-december 1989. 1. gm-resistant strains were noted in 24% of staphylococcus aureus, 12% of enterobacter spp., 24% of serratia marcescens, 7% of morganella morganii and 26% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, but no gm-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris. 2. a majority of gm-resistant strains of s. aureus were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and a large number of gm-resistant strains of enterobacter spp. was also resistant to new quinolones. gm showed, however, strong antimicrobial activities against new quinolones-resistant strains of s. marcescens, m. morganii and p. aeruginosa. 3. among all the isolates tested of s. marcescens, 24% were gm-resistant, 72% were tobramycin (tob)-resistant, 86% were dibekacin (dkb)-resistant and 64% were amikacin (amk)-resistant, hence the incidence of gm-resistant strains was the lowest. this tendency was also observed with p. vulgaris. however, among p. aeruginosa, 26% were gm-resistant, 14% tob-resistant, 18% dkb-resistant and 22% amk-resistant, thus the incidence rate for gm-resistance was somewhat higher. these results suggest that different ags-modification enzymes were produced by various clinical isolates under the present condition. 4. comparing the ratio of gm-resistant strains in the present study with those in 1980 and 1983, the ratio increased among s. aureus, while decreases were observed among enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris and p. aeruginosa, indicating that a unilateral tendency of increases in gm-resistant strains did not exist among clinical isolates over the years.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
in-vitro antibacterial activity of dq-2556 and its stability to various beta-lactamases.
dq-2556, a new cephalosporin, showed a broad antibacterial spectrum over gram-positive and -negative organisms. the activity of dq-2556 against recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and enterobacteriaceae was comparable with that of cefpirome, and superior to that of ceftazidime. dq-2556 was almost as active as cefpirome against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was less active than ceftazidime. with the exception of ps. aeruginosa, dq-2556 was bactericidal against various organisms at either the mic or twice the mic. dq-2556 bound preferentially to penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) 2, 1 and 3 of staphylococcus aureus, pbps 3, 1a and 1b of escherichia coli and pbps 1a, 3 and 4 of ps. aeruginosa. dq-2556 was stable to various penicillinases and cephalosporinases, but was unstable to oxyiminocephalosporinases. the km values of dq-2556 for the cephalosporinases of citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were only two- or three-fold higher than those of ceftazidime, indicating that dq-2556 had a relatively high affinity for these enzymes compared with other recently developed cephalosporins. the mic of dq-2556 for esch. coli increased four-fold in an ompf-deficient mutant, indicating that the ompf porin was one of the major routes for penetration of dq-2556 into esch. coli cells.
in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new carbapenem ljc10,627.
in in vitro susceptibility tests the new carbapenem ljc10,627 showed potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, except that most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains tested were found to be resistant to ljc10,627. ljc10,627 showed high activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and was active against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains which were resistant to ceftazidime and cefpirome. the ki values of ljc10,627 for penicillinase type i, cephalosporinase and oxyiminocephalosporinase were low, whereas the ki value for l-1 enzyme from xanthomonas maltophilia was high.
comparative in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone bmy-40062.
the results are presented of comparative in vitro susceptibility testing of bmy-40062, a new fluorinated quinolone which contains a tetrabutyl moiety at n-1 and a piperazinyl group at c-7. bmy-40062 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae strains at less than 0.5 microgram/ml, being either equal in activity to ciprofloxacin or two- to four-fold less active, depending upon the species. bmy-40062 was as active as ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 0.5 micrograms/ml) and inhibited most other strains of pseudomonas species at less than 1 microgram/ml. it was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae, 90% of strains being inhibited at less than 0.5 micrograms/ml. mics increased in the presence of 9 mm mg2+ and at ph 5.5. the frequency of spontaneous mutation was low for enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus (10(-10), but repeated exposure to bmy-40062 caused selection of resistant isolates. clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were resistant to bmy-40062.
in vitro activity of e-1040, a 3-substituted cephalosporin, against pathogens from cystic fibrosis sputum.
on the basis of preliminary in vitro data, we evaluated e-1040, a new cephalosporin, against 188 cystic fibrosis (cf) sputum isolates obtained from 26 cf centers in the united states. these isolates included mucoid and nonmucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, and escherichia coli. in addition to mics measured under standard conditions, selected isolates were tested at various ph values, inoculum sizes, and diluent (cf serum and sputum) conditions. e-1040 activities (mics for 50 and 90% of the strains) against the isolates were as follows: p. aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid), 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; p. cepacia, 4 and 16 micrograms/ml; s. aureus, 8 and 8 micrograms/ml; h. influenzae, 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; and e. coli, less than or equal to 0.12 and less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. e-1040 activity against mucoid p. aeruginosa was 4-fold greater than that of aztreonam, 16-fold greater than that of ceftazidime, and 32-fold greater than that of piperacillin. e-1040 was similar to other broad-spectrum cephalosporins against s. aureus, h. influenzae, and e. coli. bactericidal activity was less than or equal to 1 dilution of mic for 88% of the strains, although kinetic studies with mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa demonstrated effective killing only at eight times the mic. variations in ph from 5 to 8, in inoculum size from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml, and in diluent (cf serum or cf sputum) did not affect e-1040 activity.
antimicrobial activity of naphthoquinones from fusaria.
twenty-two naphthoquinone compounds isolated or derived synthetically from culture extracts of fusarium solani and f. oxysporum were examined for antimicrobial activity. fifteen exhibited antibiotic activity against staphylococcus aureus, and 12 were active against streptococcus pyogenes, but none were active at the highest rate of 128 micrograms/ml against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. of 8 plant pathogenic bacteria tested against 11 naphthoquinones, corynebacterium poinsettiae was inhibited by 6 compounds, and pseudomonas viridiflava was weakly inhibited by one. only one of a group of 6 fluorescent soil pseudomonads was inhibited by one naphthoquinone. antifungal activity of 10 compounds against 8 fungal plant pathogens was limited to inhibition of phytophthora parasitica by one naphthopyran.
in vitro activity of ljc10,627, a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to dehydropeptidase i.
the in vitro activity of ljc10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of  imipenem and ceftazidime. ljc10,627 had broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. the mics of this compound for 90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested (mic90s), including strains resistant to ceftazidime, ranged from 0.1 to 25 micrograms/ml. ljc10,627 inhibited pseudomonas aeruginosa at an mic90 of 3.13 micrograms/ml; it thus was twofold more active than imipenem. this compound inhibited haemophilus, neisseria, and branhamella species at mic90s of 3.13, 0.1, and 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. ljc10,627 was two- to fourfold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at mic90s of 0.1 and 0.39 microgram/ml. however, the compound was found to be twofold more active than imipenem against bacteroides fragilis at an mic90 of 1.56 microgram/ml. ljc10,627 was very stable to various beta-lactamases except for xanthomonas maltophilia oxyiminocephalosporinase type ii. ljc10,627 was minimally hydrolyzed by swine renal dehydropeptidase i; its residual activity was 93.0% after 2 h. killing kinetics of this compound for escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that bactericidal action occurred at concentrations above the mic (0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively). ljc10,627 had a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 4, and 1b(s) of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of staphylococcus aureus.
therapeutic studies of cefepime (bmy 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
cefepime (bmy 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. mice were infected intracranially with streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with haemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and s. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with s. agalactiae. cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and e. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa meningitis. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against s. pneumoniae and s. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. against h. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. ceftazidime was the least active compound. the pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
[bactericidal activity of imipenem].
the bactericidal activity of imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus was compared with that of other antibiotics, using the time-related kill rate curve method. the activity of imipenem was found to be less rapid and less intense than that of aminoglycosides, similar to that of fluoroquinolones and more rapid than that of beta-lactam antibiotics, notably ticarcillin and ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa and cefotaxime against enterobacteriaceae. as with aminoglycosides, this bactericidal activity was concentration-dependent against enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus but not against p. aeruginosa. unlike the beta-lactam antibiotics, but like aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, imipenem remained active against "quiescent" p. aeruginosa, though not against enterobacteriaceae. successive transfers into liquid media rapidly produced resistant variants among p. aeruginosa strains and methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, but not among enterobacteriaceae. this shows that the bactericidal activity of imipenem is markedly different from that of other beta-lactam antibiotics.
bipp--how does it work?
the antibacterial activity of bipp and its constituents against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa was measured by growth inhibition tests. bipp was found to have negligible antibacterial activity. in addition, no release of iodine from bipp was detected over a 4-week period. it is proposed that much of the evident antibacterial activity of bipp may be a reflection of the meticulous surgical debridement that accompanies its use. in addition, bipp makes the impregnated gauze impervious to blood and body fluids ensuring little nutrition for bacteria to thrive in its interstices.
[clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam in neonates].
clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (azt) were performed in neonates. the results are summarized as follows: a total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. azt 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. concomitantly, vancomycin (vcm) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (abpc) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for 2-6 days. of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of azt were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. all of the causative organisms (escherichia coli in 3 and enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with azt. neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by azt was observed. mics of azt against 10 clinical isolates (staphylococcus aureus 1, e. coli 4, klebsiella pneumoniae 1, e. cloacae 1, haemophilus influenzae 1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. as results, azt showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against p. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
the phototoxic inhibitory effect and phototoxic killing effect of micro-organisms.
the toxic and phototoxic growth inhibitory and killing effect of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenus gr. a, st. viridans, pityrosporum ovale and candida albicans were studied. p. ovale and st. viridans were the only micro-organisms with any toxic effect against the other micro-organisms tested. p. ovale inhibited the growth of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, ps. aeruginosa and e. coli. st. viridans inhibited the growth of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, ps. aeruginosa, e. coli, st. pyogenus gr. a and p. ovale. this effect was only growth inhibitory and not direct killing. the activity was increased by uva on s. aureus, s. epidermidis and ps. aeruginosa but not on e. coli and st. pyogenes gr. a. these effects of p. ovale and st. viridans may be of importance in the defense against infections.
endotoxin-induced suppression of lung host defenses.
respiratory tract infections are major causes of excessive morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. persons with systemic sepsis have an especially high risk of acquiring these infections, which indicates that their lung antibacterial defenses are compromised. to evaluate the effects of sepsis on pulmonary antibacterial defenses, we injected either saline or 5 mg/kg of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide intravenously into sprague-dawley rats. two hours later, the animals were challenged by aerosol inhalation with either staphylococcus aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa. it is known that phagocytic defenses against aerosolized s. aureus challenges are provided solely by the alveolar macrophage; in normal animals challenged with p. aeruginosa, however, an intrapulmonary inflammatory response is elicited. animals pretreated with endotoxin showed a significant decrease in pulmonary bactericidal activity against s. aureus with 31 +/- 3% bacteria remaining viable at 4 hr compared with 20 +/- 2% in the controls, which indicates a defect in alveolar macrophage antimicrobial activity. after p. aeruginosa challenge, saline-injected control animals developed a marked intrapulmonary inflammatory response and killed greater than 85% of their initial inoculum by 4 hr. by contrast, endotoxin-treated animals failed to recruit neutrophils into the alveoli in response to p. aeruginosa, resulting in a proliferation of this pathogen within the lung (212 +/- 6% bacteria remaining viable at 4 hr). endotoxin is known to be a potent stimulus for the production of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) by the host. tnf is a potent inflammatory mediator and promotes neutrophil adhesion to the vascular endothelium. in these experiments, serum tnf peaked at 28,390 +/- 7,766 units/ml. 90 min after intravenous endotoxin. histopathology of the lungs in these animals showed considerable sequestration of the neutrophils within the pulmonary vasculature. these data show that systemic endotoxin significantly impairs lung host defenses against intrapulmonary bacterial challenges and suggest that tnf-mediated events may play a central role.
[susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1987)].
since 1981, in cooperation with research institutions across the nation, ikemoto, et al. have been collecting clinical isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections and conducting an annual retrospective survey of patients' background factors and of isolated strains and their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. in the period from october, 1987 to september, 1988, 17 institutions participated in the survey and a total of 706 strains which were demonstrated to be causative organisms were isolated from 562 patients with respiratory tract infections. strains were mostly isolated from the sputum. the taxonomic breakdown of these strains was: staphylococcus aureus (69 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (120), haemophilus influenzae (170), mucoid-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa (42), non-mucoid-producing p. aeruginosa (87), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (35), brahamella catarrharis (72), etc. of these strains, 629 were used to determine mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics for susceptibility analyses. relationships between patient backgrounds and diagnoses and between infections diseases and causative organisms were also investigated. most of the major causative organisms, such as h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa, showed no substantial changes from previous years, with regard to their sensitivities to antibiotic agent, but s. aureus, particularly methicillin/cephem-resistant strains of s. aureus (mcrsa) showed somewhat lower sensitivity to beta-lactams, and as in recent years, to ofloxacin, a new quinolone drug, as well. regarding background factors of patients, the age distribution was heavily concentrated in age brackets of 50 years and older, thus patients in these age group accounted for 75.2% of all the patients, which was comparable to 73.5% in 1985 and 77.9% in 1986. among infections encountered, bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 28.3%, followed by chronic bronchitis (27.2%) and bronchiectasis (16.0%). bacterial pneumonia was actually the most frequent, throughout the entire age groups accounting for 34.3% of patients up to 29 years, 26.6% in the group of 30-69 years and 30.7% in patients aged 70 years and older. chronic bronchitis was next most frequent and accounted for 20.0%, 26.4% and 30.7% among the three age groups, respectively. breaking down clinical isolates by diagnosis, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa were isolated frequently from most of the infectious diseases.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
in vivo evaluation of a dual-action antibacterial, ro 23-9424, compared to cefotaxime and fleroxacin.
the dual-action antibacterial r 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. it was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (staphylococcus aureus 753, serratia marcescens sm and pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and streptococcus pyogenes. in prophylactic studies, ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against s. pyogenes, but ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against e. coli and more active than fleroxacin against s. pyogenes. in a murine pneumonia model, ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae. fleroxacin was inactive against s. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than ro 23-9424 against k. pneumoniae. in a murine meningitis infection caused by s. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was 3 times as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. when meningitis was induced by k. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. in a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against p. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. in the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.
inhibitory and bactericidal activity of cefpirome and cefotaxime against blood culture isolates.
using a broth microtiter dilution method, minimum inhibitory (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined for the aminothiazolyl cephalosporins cefpirome and cefotaxime against 436 blood culture isolates. at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 mg/l, cefpirome inhibited 82.3% of the isolates and cefotaxime 66.5%. at the same concentrations, cefpirome killed 60.0% of the isolates and cefotaxime 46.7%. whereas the mic values indicated a far better activity of cefpirome than cefotaxime against oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mbc values showed a poor activity of both drugs against these strains. by comparison, cefpirome was the more active agent, covering a similar spectrum to that of cefotaxime with a slight additional activity against oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis.
[usefulness of ceftazidime in intractable respiratory tract infections].
usefulness of ceftazidime (caz) was studied in 56 cases of intractable respiratory tract infections. caz was administered at a daily dose of 2-4 g in 2 divided doses by intravenous drip infusion for 3-15 days. 1. analysis was carried out in 38 cases and the following result was obtained. efficacy rate was: 68% (17/25) in pneumonia, 60% (3/5) in chronic bronchitis and 67% (4/6) in secondary infections in chronic respiratory disease cases, and the overall efficacy rate was 63.2% (24/38). 2. in bacteriological study, 68.2% (15/22) of eradication rate was obtained. against staphylococcus aureus, eradication was obtained in all strains (4 strains). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, eradication occurred in 4 strains out of 10, and decrease in number in 2 strains. 3. as for adverse effects, mild hepatic disorder was observed in 2 cases (3.6%) out of 56. 4. from the above result, caz is considered to be very useful when used as monotherapy for aged patients and in the treatment of severe and intractable infections accompanied by underlying diseases.
[susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1986)].
enlisting the help of various research institutions across the nation, ikemoto et al. have been pooling cultures of clinical isolates of respiratory tract infections and mapping out the correlations between patient backgrounds and the causative bacteria and the changes in the sensitivity spectra of the bacteria to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents annually since 1981. the following is a report of the 1986 findings. during the period from september, 1986 to march, 1987, 558 cases of respiratory infections were reported at 17 institutions across the nation and a total of 657 apparent causative strains were isolated from sputum samples. of these strains, 75 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 108 of streptococcus pneumoniae, 150 of haemophilus influenzae, 107 of pseudomonas aeruiginosa (non-mucoid production type), 21 of p. aeruginosa (mucoid production type), 32 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of escherichia coli, and 55 of branhamella catarrhalis were subjected to mic determination of various antibacterial and antibiotic agents to map drug sensitivities. in addition, diagnoses, age distributions by diagnoses, frequencies of infectious diseases, types of isolated bacteria, and usage statuses of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents the times of at isolation were also investigated. mic determinations were carried out to investigate susceptibilities of causative organisms of respiratory tract infections to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents. from the 558 cases of respiratory tract infections, 657 strains were detected at concentrations not less than 10(4-6)/ml and identified to be the causative organisms. of these strains, 603 could be used for mic determination. an overwhelming majority of major causative bacteria, inclusive of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae, showed sensitivity patterns similar to the sensitivity patterns found a year earlier, p. aeruginosa alone, however, showed some increase in its susceptibility to penicillin and cephem antibiotics. regarding patient backgrounds, the age distribution was heavily biased towards the higher end of the scale, which patients with ages of 50 or higher accounting for 77.9%, compared to 73.5% in 1985. when the patients were classified by diagnoses, chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia and bronchiectasis accounted for the majority of the infections: 28.7%, 23.3%, and 19.0%, respectively. the percentages of chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia 28.7% and 23.3%, respectively, were somewhat higher in 1986 than in 1985. the disease which was comparatively frequent in all age groups was bronchiectasis, which accounted for 44.0% in patients with ages 29 years or lower, 18.4% in patients between 30 years and 69 years, and 16.7% in patients with ages 70 years or higher. the next most frequent infection was bacterial pneumonia.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
ofloxacin: a review.
ofloxacin is a new fluorinated quinolone antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity against a variety of gram-positive and -negative bacteria including enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. in addition, ofloxacin has significant activity against neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, and mycobacterium tuberculosis and this may give rise to new indications for the class of quinolone antibiotics. clinical trials to date have demonstrated the efficacy of ofloxacin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and sexually transmitted diseases. adverse effects to ofloxacin are usually mild and include gastrointestinal, central nervous system, and hypersensitivity reactions. significant drug interactions with ofloxacin have not been reported.
[clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
in vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mics and the results of disk susceptibility tests. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the mic80s of imipenem (ipm) against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal mic distribution. however, the distribution of mics against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. group a streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by ipm at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. ipm inhibited escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a mic of 25 micrograms/ml, serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with mic greater than 100 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. indole (-) proteus and indole (+) proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the ipm disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. for the interpretation of the showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa ipm disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). with showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, the differentiation of strains with mics less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set mic break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. according to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
the efficacy of nystatin combined with topical microbial agents in the treatment  of burn wound sepsis.
pilot in vitro studies demonstrated that nystatin combined with silvadene (silver sulfadiazine 1% [marion laboratories, inc., kansas city mo.]) or furacin in a 1:1 ratio was equally effective against candida albicans and atcc strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli, but sulfamylon (winthrop pharmaceuticals, winthrop, n.y.) combined with nystatin demonstrated an antagonistic response. therefore we examined the susceptibility to nystatin of 165 clinical isolates, both gram-positive and gram-negative, to nystatin combined with silvadene or sulfamylon and 144 isolates to nystatin and furacin. both silvadene and furacin combined with nystatin were equally effective against the microorganisms as were the individual drugs. conversely, sulfamylon combined with nystatin lost its antimicrobial capability (93.3% resistance, p less than 0.001). on the basis of the in vitro results, 93 patients with acute burns were treated with the appropriate topical antimicrobials from april 1988 to september 1988. of the 93 patients treated, 90 had neither a major systemic bacterial nor a candida sepsis, and none of these patients had associated localized burn wound sepsis during their hospital stays. these 90 patients were discharged without any documented signs of infection. the average burnsize was greater than or equal to 29.44% total body surface area. these data suggest that the antimicrobial properties of nystatin, when combined with silvadene and furacin, remain effective. consequently, such combinations have been effective in controlling both local and systemic candida and bacterial burn wound sepsis.
in vitro activity of dactimicin, a novel pseudodisaccharide aminoglycoside, compared with activities of other aminoglycosides.
the in vitro activity of dactimicin, a new pseudodisaccharide aminoglycoside which possesses a formimidoyl group, was compared with those of gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin against 500 isolates. dactimicin inhibited 90% of isolates from the family enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. it was more active than amikacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, enterobacter agglomerans, yersinia species, and salmonella species, with an mic for 90% of the strains (mic90) of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. the mic90s for the pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. dactimicin did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates and coagulase-negative staphylococci but had an mic50 (mic for 50% of strains tested) of 2 micrograms/ml against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates and coagulase-negative staphylococci. dactimicin in combination with piperacillin acted synergistically against 75% of escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus isolates. it exhibited an excellent postantibiotic suppressive effect on e. coli. dactimicin was active against organisms possessing aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including aac(2')-b, aac(3)-iii, -iv, and -v, and aac(6')-ia, -ib, ic, -ii, and -iv but was not active against isolates which contained aac(3)-i and the bifunctional aph(2")-aac(6')-i. its lack of activity against p. aeruginosa appeared to be permeability related since in the presence of edta p. aeruginosa was susceptible, as were mutant isolates resistant because of permeability barriers.
cefixime. a review of its antibacterial activity. pharmacokinetic properties and  therapeutic potential.
cefixime, previously designated fk027, fr17027 and cl284635, is an orally active  cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro. it is particularly active against many enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and branhamella catarrhalis, and is resistant to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. cefixime has little activity against staphylococcus aureus and is inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefixime is distinguished by its 3-hour elimination half-life which permits twice daily, or in many instances once daily, administration. comparative trials, though few, indicate that the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefixime 200 to 400mg daily administered as a single dose or in 2 divided doses, is comparable with that of multiple daily doses of co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole) or amoxycillin in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection, with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and cefaclor in acute lower respiratory tract infections, and with that of amoxycillin and cefroxidine in adult patients with acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis. several comparative trials in children with acute otitis media demonstrate the similar effectiveness of cefixime 8 mg/kg daily (in 2 divided doses, or as a single daily dose), cefaclor 20 to 40 mg/kg daily and amoxycillin 40 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses. the most frequently reported adverse effects, diarrhoea and stool changes, are usually mild to moderate in severity, transient, and mostly occur in the first few days of treatment with cefixime. thus, cefixime is an effective orally active cephalosporin with a relatively long elimination half-life permitting a simplified treatment regimen. it is a suitable alternative to cefaclor or amoxycillin in acute otitis media and acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and to amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents.
the fluoroquinolones, a new class of potent orally absorbed antimicrobial agents, are reviewed, considering structure, mechanisms of action and resistance, spectrum, variables affecting activity in vitro, pharmacokinetic properties, clinical efficacy, emergence of resistance, and tolerability. the primary bacterial target is the enzyme deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase. bacterial resistance occurs by chromosomal mutations altering deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase and decreasing drug permeation. the drugs are bactericidal and potent in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus spp., and neisseria spp., have good activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococci, and (with several exceptions) are less potent against streptococci and have fair to poor activity against anaerobic species. potency in vitro decreases in the presence of low ph, magnesium ions, or urine but is little affected by different media, increased inoculum, or serum. the effects of the drugs in combination with a beta-lactam or aminoglycoside are often additive, occasionally synergistic, and rarely antagonistic. the agents are orally absorbed, require at most twice-daily dosing, and achieve high concentrations in urine, feces, and kidney and good concentrations in lung, bone, prostate, and other tissues. the drugs are efficacious in treatment of a variety of bacterial infections, including uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections, bacterial gastroenteritis, and gonorrhea, and show promise for therapy of prostatitis, respiratory tract infections, osteomyelitis, and cutaneous infections, particularly when caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. fluoroquinolones have also proved to be efficacious for prophylaxis against travelers' diarrhea and infection with gram-negative bacilli in neutropenic patients. the drugs are effective in eliminating carriage of neisseria meningitidis. patient tolerability appears acceptable, with gastrointestinal or central nervous system toxicities occurring most commonly, but only rarely necessitating discontinuance of therapy. in 17 of 18 prospective, randomized, double-blind comparisons with another agent or placebo, fluoroquinolones were tolerated as well as or better than the comparison regimen. bacterial resistance has been uncommonly documented but occurs, most notably with p. aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and occasionally other species for which the therapeutic ratio is less favorable. fluoroquinolones offer an efficacious, well-tolerated, and cost-effective alternative to parenteral therapies of selected infections.
in vitro activity of me1228, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
me1228 is a new cephalosporin with an iminocarboxymethyl moiety on the acyl side  chain and a novel pyridiniumthiomethyl group at position 3 of the bicyclic ring. its activity was compared with those of ceftazidime, imipenem, piperacillin, and gentamicin. me1228 inhibited most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, except for some enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii, at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and it inhibited gentamicin- and piperacillin-resistant isolates. it had mics for pseudomonas aeruginosa between 1 and 32 micrograms/ml, comparable to those of ceftazidime, and it inhibited piperacillin- and gentamicin-resistant isolates. most group a, b, c, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. enterococci and listeriae were resistant (mics, 64 to 128 micrograms/ml). the mics for staphylococci were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was resistant. there was a minimal inoculum effect and no effect of the medium. me1228 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, and s. aureus plasmid beta-lactamases and was stable against hydrolysis by richmond-sykes type 1a, 1c, 1d, and iv chromosomal beta-lactamases. it was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and xanthomonas maltophilia beta-lactamases. overall, me1228 had activity comparable or superior to that of ceftazidime.
studies on antibacterial agents. i. synthesis of substituted 6,7-dihydro-1-oxo-1h,5h-benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acids.
a series of substituted 6,7-dihydro-1-oxo-1h,5h-benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acids was synthesized and tested for antibacterial activities. among them, 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-5-methyl-8-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-1-oxo-1h,5h- benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid (opc-7241) exhibited potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxy-1-piperidyl)-5-methyl-1-oxo-1h, 5h-benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid (opc-7251) showed potent activity characteristically against propionibacterium acnes.
comparative in vitro activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
the in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. the two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., and bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against xanthomonas maltophilia, and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against morganella morganii. enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. in general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against klebsiella spp., c. diversus, x. maltophilia, and bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against escherichia coli and proteeae. there was little or no enhancement of activity against enterococcus faecalis, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, or acinetobacter anitratus. clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin. in a direct comparison of the activities of ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, the two were equally active against h. influenzae, b. catarrhalis, and s. aureus; the latter was more active against e. faecalis. for relatively susceptible strains of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, neither combination was predictably more active than the other, but relatively resistant strains were generally more susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. piperacillin-tazobactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate against a. hydrophila, p. aeruginosa, and p. cepacia, similar in activity against a. anitratus, and less active against x. maltophilia and bacteroides spp.
[studies on 145 cases of septicemia in infancy and childhood--especially on septicemic patients with malignant and hematological diseases].
clinical and bacteriological data of 145 inpatients with septicemia, treated at the hospital of chiba university school of medicine from 1972 to 1987, were reviewed by dividing them into three stages. (stages i: 1972-76, stage ii: 1978-82, stage iii: 1983-87) patients with underlying diseases have been increasing: 91.8% of the total patients in stage iii. among the patients with underlying diseases, malignant and hematological diseases occupied about 60%, and in the other diseases, congenital heart diseases have been increasing in number. as to the organisms isolated, gram positive bacteria have increased, while gram negative bacteria have decreased. in stage iii, the rate of gram positive organisms and gram negative ones accounted for 43.1% and 41.2% of all the isolates from the septic patients with malignant & hematological diseases, respectively. in patients with malignant & hematological diseases, alpha-streptococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and fusobacterium sp. have been increasing, whereas, escherichia coli, enterobacter sp., klebsiella sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa decreasing. in patients with other underlying diseases, s. aureus, cns, and non fermenters have been increasing. among the patients without underlying diseases, gram positive bacteria accounted for the major part. the decrease of gram negative organisms in patients with malignant and hematological diseases may partially depend on the introduction of polymixin b as the drug of gut decontamination. the outcome of septicemia in the patients with malignant & hematological diseases has been markedly improving through all the three stages. during stage iii, episode mortality and case mortality rate proved to be 23% and 31%, respectively. the introduction of the third generation cephems has decreased the mortality rate for gram negative organisms and contributed to the improvement of the total prognosis. the prognosis was worst in the case of p. aeruginosa, showing a mortality rate of 50% during stage iii. coincidence rate of blood and other cultures have been largest in the case of p. aeruginosa, so, the drug sensitivity of the strain cultured from other sites is sometimes useful in the choice of antibiotics.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new carbapenem, sm-7338.
sm-7338, a new carbapenem, inhibited most members of the family enterobacteriaceae at mics of 0.015 to 0.25 microgram/ml, including klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus vulgaris isolates resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and gentamicin. it was two- to eightfold more active than imipenem, but it inhibited pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1 to 8 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of imipenem. haemophilus, neisseria, and branhamella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, which was superior to the activity of imipenem. sm-7338 inhibited staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at 0.25 microgram/ml, but for methicillin-resistant isolates mics were 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. group a, b, and c streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. bacteroides species, including clindamycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 0.25 microgram/ml. there was no major inoculum size effect, and the mbcs were within a dilution of the mics. sm-7338 was more active than imipenem at an acid ph under anaerobic conditions. plasmid beta-lactamases of tem-1, tem-2, tem-3, tem-5, shv-1, shv-2, pse-1, pse-2, pse-3, oxa-2, oxa-3, oxa-4, oxa-5, and oxa-7; staphylococcus aureus enzymes; and the chromosomal beta-lactamases p-99 and k-1; morganella species; and proteus vulgaris did not hydrolyze sm-7338. the repeated transfer of organisms increased the mics of sm-7338, as it did the mics of imipenem.
comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, am-1091.
the in vitro activity of a new quinolone, am-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. am-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. for many species am-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. it inhibited enterobacter, citrobacter, and klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. ninety percent of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species am-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. am-1091 was more active against pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. most haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. the mics for 90% of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. am-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. am-1091 inhibited 90% of the bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. the frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. although am-1091 had lower in vitro activity at ph 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. am-1091 rapidly killed escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
in vitro activity of s-ofloxacin.
s-ofloxacin, the optically active form of ofloxacin, was twice as active as the s,r mixture of ofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive species. of the enterobacteriaceae, 90% were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and 90% of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes isolates were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. organisms resistant to ofloxacin were resistant to s-ofloxacin. like ofloxacin activity, the activity of s-ofloxacin was reduced by mg2+ and by acid ph. spontaneous mutational resistance to s-ofloxacin was similar to that to ofloxacin.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of bmy 40062, a new fluoronaphthyridone.
the in vitro and in vivo activities of a new naphthyridone, bmy 40062, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. bmy 40062 showed about threefold more activity than ciprofloxacin showed and four- to eightfold more activity than ofloxacin showed against staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. bmy 40062 showed generally twofold less activity than ciprofloxacin showed against most species of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter spp. but twofold more activity than ofloxacin showed against these organisms. bmy 40062 and ofloxacin were more active than ciprofloxacin against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. the antiureaplasmal and antichlamydial activities of bmy 40062 were similar to those of the tetracyclines and were 4- and 16-fold, respectively, higher than those of ciprofloxacin. the in vitro activities of bmy 40062 were influenced by ph and magnesium, although these factors appeared to affect the activity of bmy 40062 against p. aeruginosa to a lesser extent than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. bmy 40062 was found to be bactericidal, and cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones was observed. in mouse protection tests, the efficacy of bmy 40062 reflected its in vitro potency. bmy 40062 exhibited longer half-life, higher maximum concentration in serum, greater area under the curve, and better bioavailability in mice after oral dosing than ciprofloxacin. compared with ofloxacin, bmy 40062 had a lower maximum concentration in serum but a much longer half-life in mice. bmy 40062 was more effective than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in penetrating mouse macrophages and killing macrophage-associated staphylococcus aureus.
antimicrobial activity of ro 23-9424, a novel ester-linked codrug of fleroxacin and desacetylcefotaxime.
ro 23-9424 is a novel ester-linked codrug of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240; am-833) and  the cefotaxime metabolite desacetylcefotaxime. its potency was determined against over 1,000 organisms and found to be intermediate between those of the two components. more than 99% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by greater than or equal micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml; its mic for 50% of strains tested ranged from greater than or equal to 0.06 to 1 micrograms/ml. staphylococci, streptococci, branhamella catarrhalis, corynebacterium jeikeium, bacillus spp., haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and the pathogenic neisseria spp., including oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-producing strains, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, were also inhibited by ro 23-9424. pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp., and bacteroides fragilis group isolates were more refractory to ro 23-9424 (the mic for 90% of strains tested was less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). overall, ro 23-9424 inhibited 97% of the aerobic strains, compared with 90% for ceftazidime and 92% for cefoperazone. ro 23-9424 was bactericidal, was relatively stable to inoculum effects on mics at 10(7) cfu/ml, and was determined to be highly active against organisms resistant to fluoroquinolones or ceftazidime. preliminary quality control guidelines were determined, and a 30-micrograms disk concentration appears to be the most usable form.
evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin against staphylococci, enterococci, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin and other antibiotics (norfloxacin, beta-lactams, cotrimoxazole, netilmicin, and miokamycin) was evaluated against 317 clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. lomefloxacin showed a high in vitro activity against a wide variety of bacterial species. against enterobacteriaceae, lomefloxacin displayed the highest activity (mic90s, less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), and it was usually more active than ampicillin and netilmicin, and often more active than cotrimoxazole. lomefloxacin showed a good antimicrobial activity also against both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, as it was able to inhibit 90% of staphylococcal strains at a concentration less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. against enterococci and p. aeruginosa, lomefloxacin was usually less active (mic90s, 8 micrograms/ml). as compared to norfloxacin, lomefloxacin displayed an overall similar activity against staphylococci and enterococci, but appeared less active against gram-negative bacteria. bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin against e. coli, when assayed by a novel method, proved to be high, and results indicate that an oral dose of 200 mg of lomefloxacin should exert a very high bactericidal activity against e. coli in urinary tract infections, even in those sustained by large bacterial populations.
pacidamycins, a novel series of antibiotics with anti-pseudomonas aeruginosa activity. iii. microbiologic profile.
pacidamycins are nucleosidyl-peptide antibiotics which have activity only against pseudomonas aeruginosa. their mics for other organisms such as enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, most streptococci and other pseudomonas species are greater than 100 micrograms/ml. these compounds had no activity against erythromycin-susceptible streptococci. the mics for streptococcus pyogenes with constitutive- and inducible-type of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance were 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mics against p. aeruginosa ranged from 8 to 64 micrograms/ml. the activity of these compounds was 1 to 2-fold less in serum than broth. time-kill curves were performed using 4 and 8 times the mic of pacidamycin 1. it was bactericidal against p. aeruginosa (3 log10 decrease in 4 to 6 hours). at 24 hours, resistant mutants were found in the cultures. the mics of piperacillin and gentamicin for these mutants were the same as for the parent strain. the frequency of resistance to these compounds was less than 3.5 x 10(-6). the resistant mutants were stable after 10 transfers in antibiotic-free medium. the pacidamycins were inactive against p. aeruginosa in mouse protection test. after a single subcutaneous injection of 25 mg/kg of pacidamycin 1, the cmax was approximately 50 micrograms/ml and the serum half-life was 0.5 hour.
in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101.
the in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. fce 22101 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. ducreyi, neisseria gonorrhoeae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis and group b streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with mic90 of greater than 32 mg/l. streptococcus faecalis displayed mic90 of 16 mg/l. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., peptococcus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated mics. fce 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
a total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. however, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of s. aureus and s. epidermidis. for escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
in-vitro activity of pd 117558, a new quinolone against bacterial isolates from cancer patients.
the in-vitro activity of pd 117558, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, was compared to that of four other quinolones, imipenem and ceftazidime against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative isolates from cancer patients. pd 117558 was found to have a broad antimicrobial spectrum with excellent activity against all gram-positive isolates (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus faecalis and group jk-corynebacteria). it was also extremely active against gram-negative bacilli with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa against which ciprofloxacin was more active. fleroxacin was slightly less active and s-25930 and s-25932 considerably less active than pd 117558. pd 117558 also had lower minimal inhibitory concentrations for most organisms tested than either imipenem or ceftazidime.
in vitro antibacterial activity of sm-7338, a carbapenem antibiotic with stability to dehydropeptidase i.
sm-7338, a new carbapenem antibiotic, was demonstrated to have potent antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of aerobes, including staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp., members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp., and gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes in a collection of 1,102 unselected clinical isolates. at a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml, sm-7338 inhibited 90% of these strains. the spectrum of activity of ceftazidime and cefotaxime was more limited, and many of the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. were resistant to these agents, piperacillin, or gentamicin. a collection of ofloxacin-resistant strains was inhibited by sm-7338 or imipenem at 4 micrograms/ml. sm-7338 was more active than metronidazole and clindamycin against anaerobes. of the carbapenems, imipenem had greater activity against staphylococci but sm-7338 was much more active against haemophilus, branhamella, and neisseria spp. and all genera of enterobacteriaceae tested. the mic of sm-7338 for 90% of these strains ranged from less than or equal to 0.008 to 0.13 micrograms/ml. when tested against 124 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, sm-7338 inhibited 76% at 0.5 microgram/ml but imipenem inhibited only 15% at this concentration. both carbapenems exhibited similar activities against bacteroides spp., but sm-7338 was more active than imipenem against clostridium spp. the mbc of sm-7338 was most commonly the same as or twice the mic. sm-7338 and imipenem showed excellent activities against bacteria elaborating chromosome- or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, including those conferring resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. the activity of sm-7338 was generally unaffected by the culture medium used, ph, 25% human serum, and inoculum size, but the susceptibility of xanthomonas maltophilia was medium dependent.
antimicrobial effectiveness of six paradols. 1: a structure-activity relationship study.
the pattern of antimicrobial effectiveness of (0)-, (2)-, (3)-, (4)-, (8)- and (9)-paradols was studied. (3)- paradol was more active than the other homologues with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 1 mg/ml when tested against proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and botryodiplodia theobromae. at 0.2 mg/ml, (3)-paradol completely inhibited the spore germination of trichophyton mentagrophytes and after 3 h of exposure at 0.5 mg/ml, it inhibited the growth of a heavy inoculum of staphylococcus aureus (1 x 10(9) cells/ml).
antibacterial activity of norfloxacin against 1700 relatively resistant clinical  isolates.
a total of 1724 clinical isolates from patients with different infections were tested in vitro to determine their susceptibility to norfloxacin. antibacterial activity of norfloxacin was compared with other drugs that were commonly used in the hospital. of the 919 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, all except four isolates of enterobacter, two of serratia and one of proteus were susceptible to norfloxacin. ninety-five percent of the 199 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were also inhibited by this quinolone. brucella melitensis (81 strains) was completely susceptible to norfloxacin. all the 250 isolates of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also sensitive to norfloxacin. pseudomonads other than p.aeruginosa, acinetobacter/alcaligenes and group d streptococci were less sensitive to norfloxacin, with 56%, 57% and 20% respectively being inhibited by this antimicrobial agent.
associative growth of yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 with pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus in a diffusion apparatus. (ecologen).
to evaluate associative growth of psychorotrophic p. aeruginosa and s. aureus with y. enterocolitica 0:3, microorganisms were grown in trypticase soy broth in a diffusion apparatus (ecologen) and incubated for 9 days at 4 degrees c. the effects of culture interactions were determined by growth curves, lag times, generation times, ph changes and acid production. the observed growth curves for y. enterocolitica 0:3, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus, shows the stimulating effects of y. enterocolitica 0:3 on growth of psychotrophic microorganisms in associative culture at 4 degrees c, although it was later inhibited by these organisms as they reached the stationary phase, thus proving itself to be a poor competitor with common spoilage microorganism.
effect of date extract on growth and spore germination of bacillus subtilis.
berhi date extract was studied for its effect on the growth of bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa. from 80 to 99% inhibition was observed in nutrient broth cultures containing 20% (w/v) date extract. spore germination of b. subtilis was inhibited completely using various concentrations of date extract. cell elongation and depression in the cell wall of b. subtilis were seen by scanning electron microscopy as a result of incubation in a growth medium containing dates.
[antagonistic action of pseudomonas aeruginosa against staphylococci, coliform bacilli and various types of proteus].
antagonistic activity of 2 fresh isolates and 3 collection strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa against 177 microbial strains was determined with the method of late antagonism. among the microbial strains there were 56 staphylococcal strains isolated from patents and carriers. 38 nontypable colon bacilli isolated from healthy persons, 59 enteropathogenic colon bacilli of various serogroups, 12 strains of proteus and 12 colon bacilli, carriers of multiple drug resistance factors (r factors). all the cultures were sensitive to the antagonistic action of 5 or at least 3 strains of pseudomonas used in the study. the most active antagonists were the fresh isolates of pseudomonas as compared to the collection strains. among the staphylococci s. aureus proved to be the most resistant to the antagonistic action of pseudomonas as compared to s. epidermidis, the same as the strains isolated from carriers as compared to the strains isolated from patients. as for the enteric bacilli the most resistant were the strains of proteus. acquiring of transmissive r factors by the colon bacilli markedly increased their sensitivity to the antagonistic action of pseudomonas.
[activity of cefpirome against bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients].
the activity of cefpirome (hr 810) was evaluated against 247 strains isolated from patients developing their infections while in a hospital in buenos aires. its activity against gram negative bacilli was compared with ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cephalotin, piperacillin, amikacin, gentamicin and norfloxacin. in terms of mic50 and mic90 (mg/l) it was as follows: klebsiella pneumoniae: less than 0.125, less than 2.0; pseudomonas aeruginosa: less than 8, less than 16; escherichia coli: less than 0.016, less than 0.063; serratia marcescens: less than 0.063, less than 1.0; enterobacter cloacae: less than 0.125, less than 1.0. cefpirome was more active than the other cephalosporins against p. aeruginosa: at 16 mg/l, this drug inhibited 95% of strains versus 60% for ceftazidime and 32% for ceftriaxone. activity of norfloxacine against gram negative bacilli was similar to cefpirome, while piperacillin and the aminoglycosides were less active. cefpirome was more active than cepahallotin against streptococcus faecalis (2.0, 32) although less active than ampicillin, piperacillin, rifampicin and vancomycin. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (less than 0.25, less than 1.0) it was more active than cephalotin and the other drugs evaluated (piperacillin, erythromycin, chloranphenicol, aminogycosides). like cephalotin, the activity of cefpirome against methicillin-resistant strains was variable (1.0, 32).
[bactericidal action of lomefloxacin a new pyridonecarboxylic acid derivative].
lomefloxacin (ny-198) [(+/-)-1-ethyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(3-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxo -3- quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride] strongly inhibited the growths of not only gram-negative escherichia coli but gram-positive staphylococcus aureus. in vivo and in vitro experiments showed deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) synthesis was specifically inhibited by this drug in e. coli.
immunomodulation by altered gastrointestinal tract flora. the effects of orally administered, killed staphylococcus epidermidis, candida, and pseudomonas on systemic immune responses.
we investigated the role of microbial products from the gastrointestinal tract in the pathogenesis of immunosuppression in critical illness. rats were gavaged daily for three weeks with killed staphylococcus epidermidis, candida, and pseudomonas--organisms frequently isolated from the upper gastrointestinal tract of the critically ill patient; nonspecific immunity was measured by the delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth) response. gavage with either pseudomonas or candida resulted in significant suppression of dth responses, while gavage with s epidermidis produced modest enhancement of dth. animals given pseudomonas demonstrated impaired ability to localize a subcutaneous staphylococcus aureus challenge and decreased igm but enhanced anti-pseudomonas iga and igg responses after intraperitoneal immunization. pulmonary bacterial clearance at seven days was normal. these findings suggest that gut colonization with candida or pseudomonas may contribute to impairment of cell-mediated immunity in the critically ill patient.
in vitro activities of pd 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
the in vitro activity of pd 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) cfu per spot). the activity of pd 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. pd 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp., serratia marcescens, and branhamella catarrhalis (mics for 90% of the isolates [mic90s], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas spp. pd 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, legionella pneumophila, and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups a, b, c, and g, s. pneumoniae, and enterococci (mic90s, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). against staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, pd 117,596 (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against corynebacterium spp. pd 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
resistance studies with ofloxacin.
the selection of ofloxacin-resistant mutants from susceptible wild-type bacterial populations was investigated by three methods. resistant mutants selected from populations of escherichia coli (nctc 10418) and staphylococcus aureus (nctc 6571) by single-step passage at either four or eight times the mic occurred at a frequency of less than 1 x 10(-10). ofloxacin-resistant mutants of pseudomonas aeruginosa (nctc 10662), selected at four times the mic, occurred with a 100-fold greater frequency at 3.3 x 10(-8), however, mutants of this species selected at eight times the mic, occurred at a frequency of less than 1 x 10(-10). sequential selection of ofloxacin-resistant mutants during multiple passages at 1/2 mic, resulted in a 16- to 32-fold increase in mics for isolates of p. aeruginosa and klebsiella aerogenes, a four- to eight-fold increase in mics for some strains of e. coli and a two- to four-fold increase in mics for staph. aureus and streptococcus spp. during prolonged exposure of populations of e. coli (nctc 10418) and staph. aureus (nctc 6571) to concentrations of ofloxacin at 1, 10 and 100 times the mic no resistant-mutants were selected after seven days incubation. in similar experiments with p. aeruginosa (nctc 10662) ofloxacin-resistant mutants were selected from populations exposed to the mic which required 64 mg/l ofloxacin for inhibition. no ofloxacin-resistant mutants were selected from populations of p. aeruginosa (nctc 10662) exposed to either ten or 100 times the mic.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
respiratory-mucin inhibition of the opsonophagocytic killing of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequent respiratory tract colonizer in diseases in which mucociliary clearance is defective. the most striking of these is cystic fibrosis. the reasons for this organism's ability to colonize the respiratory tract and to persist there are not fully understood. earlier studies showed that p. aeruginosa adheres preferentially to tracheobronchial mucin when compared with enterobacteria. we reasoned that if adherence to respiratory mucin protected p. aeruginosa from opsonophagocytic killing, then the ability of this organism to chronically colonize the respiratory tract could be partially explained. using an opsonophagocytic killing assay with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, we found that respiratory mucin protected six strains of p. aeruginosa from opsonophagocytic killing but did not protect poorly adhering strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or group b streptococci. incubating p. aeruginosa with the mucin prior to addition to the opsonic assay inhibited phagocytic killing, whereas incubation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with mucin did not, suggesting that inhibition was not due to an effect of mucin on leukocytes per se but was a consequence of bacterial adherence to mucin. further studies indicated no decrease in the binding of either antibody or complement component c3 to the bacterial surface in the presence of mucin. this suggests that phagocytic inhibition may be due to a defect in uptake or destruction of mucin-coated bacteria by the leukocytes. thus, the adherence of p. aeruginosa to respiratory mucin potentially contributes to its persistence in the respiratory tract by interfering with host immune responses.
[the microbial factor in the chemiluminescence of the peripheral blood neutrophils of patients with suppurative surgical infection].
the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence of neutrophils in the peripheral blood of 30 healthy adults and 39 patients with the local and generalized forms of purulent infection was studied. nonstimulated chemiluminescence and the index of chemiluminescence stimulation in the presence of opsonized staphylococcus aureus added in vitro were determined. the former characteristic was found to be directly and the latter one, inversely related to the concentration of s. aureus, escherichia coli and candida albicans, but not e. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa or citrobacter, in the primary focus. at the microbial concentration exceeding 10(4) cells/g of tissue, the former characteristic was essentially higher than the level of chemiluminescence in healthy persons. with the improvement of the general state of the patients and in the absence of microorganisms in the wound as the result of complex treatment this characteristic decreased to values comparable with the reaction of neutrophils in healthy persons.
[clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
reliability of the cefamandole (cmd) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cmd). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cmd disc tests, which is normally used in japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. the results obtained with the disc method were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cmd disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. in this study, approximately 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by cmd at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to cmd at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. cmd was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. about 90% of staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml cmd of highly methicillin-resistant strains (mic greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of s. aureus were examined. ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to cmd, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of t-3262, a new fluoroquinolone.
t-3262, a new fluoroquinolone, showed a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. t-3262 had most potent activity against gram-positive cocci, such as staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus spp. the mics of t-3262 for 90% of strains tested were between 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the activities of t-3262 were almost equal to those of ciprofloxacin. obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to t-3262. t-3262 was bactericidal for one strain each of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and p. aeruginosa at concentrations near its mic; and fluoroquinolones, including t-3262, inhibited dna gyrase activity at low concentrations. the 50% effective dose of t-3262 after oral administration against systemic infections with s. aureus in mice was about 6 times lower than that of ofloxacin and about 20 times lower than that of norfloxacin.
comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, t-3262 (a-60969).
the in vitro activity of a new quinolone, t-3262 [a-60969; dl-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. t-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. ninety percent of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. it was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against pseudomonas cepacia and pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. most haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. the mic for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for enterococcus faecalis. it inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. the frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. t-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus.
application of a microcomputer-based system in the analysis of infection data at  the emergency units of a large hospital.
after three years of retrospective study in four emergency units from a large hospital (2000 beds) and analysis of 6283 positive cultures, a microcomputer database system was built to store information concerning nosocomial infections in order to help the clinical staff from those units to study the incidence of 20 bacterial species and their sensitivity pattern evolutions for 27 antibiotics (from samples in 15 different collecting sites). this system was developed as an alternative to the hospital mainframe computer microbiological reports. it put emphasis on graphical outputs instead of the coded tables generated by the bigger system. this orientation and the possibility of sectorial infection data analysis were responsible for the general acceptance of the microcomputer-based system by the clinical staff. as the first practical results, the system was able to detect a particular increase in the incidence of staphylococcus aureus in surgical emergency units (up to 21.6% in 1982) as well as the dissemination of the antimicrobial resistance patterns of s. aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae from the surgical units to the clinical ones. the time evolution behaviour of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and other nonfermentative gram negative bacilli was also studied to complete the analysis of the most pathogenic bacterial species found in our emergency units.
in vitro activities of two oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, dup 721 and dup 105.
the antibacterial activities of dup 105 and dup 721, new oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, were compared with those of beta-lactams and glycopeptides. ninety percent of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, including methicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 4 micrograms of dup 105 and 1 microgram of dup 721 per ml. dup 721 inhibited hemolytic streptococcus groups a, b, c, f, and g at a concentration of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and it inhibited viridans group streptococci at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml. both agents inhibited listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium group jk species, anaerobic cocci, and clostridium spp. including clostridium difficile. they did not inhibit members of the family enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the mic for 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates was 8 micrograms of dup 721 per ml.
in vitro activity of temafloxacin, a new difluoro quinolone antimicrobial agent.
temafloxacin, a new difluoro quinolone, inhibited the majority of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. it was 4-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin and 2-fold less active than ofloxacin. cefotaxime and imipenem-resistant isolates such as enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited. temafloxacin inhibited neisseria, branhamella, and haemophilus species at less than 0.25 microgram/ml. methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and clostridium spp. were inhibited at concentrations less or equal to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
a-61827 (a-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
a-61827 (a-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of a-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the mics of a-61827 for 90% of strains (mic90) of staphylococci and streptococci were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. the mic90s of a-61827 for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold dilutions more active than a-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter jejuni, and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of a-61827 per ml. the mic90 of a-61827 for legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. a-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. the mic90 of a-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. in mouse protection tests, a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse bacteroides fragilis abscess model. after oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of a-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.
rapid mic testing with the sensititre autoreader.
automated microdilution mic results, obtained with the autoreader (sensititre, inc., salem, n.h.) following 5 h of incubation, were compared with manually read, concurrent control mics following 18 h of incubation in a three-laboratory comparative study. a total of 704 members of the family enterobacteriaceae or similar gram-negative organisms were tested against 17 antimicrobial agents. autoreader mics were within 1 doubling dilution of control values in 92.9% of instances. discrepancies of +/- 2 doubling dilutions and +/- 3 or greater doubling dilutions were noted in 4.5 and 2.6%, respectively, of the 7,687 drug-organism combinations analyzed. the majority of errors occurred when beta-lactam antimicrobial agents were tested with a variety of different species. mics at 5 h, when pseudomonas aeruginosa was used, were possible in only half the isolates tested and yielded data on only a limited number of drugs in the remaining instances. excluding results obtained with penicillin and ampicillin, which were uniformly poor, staphylococcus aureus autoreader values were within +/- 1 doubling dilution of control values in 93.6% of instances, 5.4% varied by +/- 2 dilutions, and only 1% of test values by +/- 3 or more dilutions from control values for 82 isolates tested against nine antimicrobial agents. of eight additional s. aureus isolates tested that were resistant to methicillin, only one was read correctly by the autoreader, with results on the remaining seven appearing as either insufficient growth or as total resistance to all drugs tested. interlaboratory reproducibility was excellent for selected isolates of s. aureus and gram-negative bacilli. the accuracy of the sensititre autoreader mic results was comparable to that of other same-day quantitative systems for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus, while the economic and procedural advantages of the broth microdilution method was maintained.
in vitro studies on the antibacterial activity of phenoxyethanol in combination with lemon grass oil.
lemon grass oil (lgo) has been reported to possess appreciable antibacterial activity especially against grampositive bacteria. the effect of lgo on the antibacterial activity of phenoxyethanol was studied using mic, growth inhibition, diffusion tests and bactericidal activity studies. results showed appreciable increase in the activity of phenoxyethanol against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus when combined with 0.03% v/v lgo but not against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the results show that the combined use of lgo and phenoxyethanol would increase the spectrum of activity of phenoxyethanol whose activity is mainly against ps. aeruginosa. in addition, the combination reduced the effective concentration of both compounds necessary for activity. this would reduce any toxicological hazards as well as production costs.
[susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro23-6240), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone against isolates from cancer patients.
the in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro23-6240; am 833), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and a-56620, against 747 isolates from cancer patients. fleroxacin inhibited more than 90% of enterobacteriacea isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it was also extremely active against aeromonas hydrophila and haemophilus influenzae isolates with mic90 values of 0.12 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for acinetobacter spp. was 1.0 micrograms/ml, for pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas fluorescens 4.0 micrograms/ml, and for other pseudomonas spp., 8.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus aureus isolates including methicillin-resistant strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. the mic90 for three different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci was 1.0 microgram/ml. streptococcal species required 8-16 micrograms/ml for inhibition. fleroxacin was also active against group jk-diphtheroids and bacillus cereus. the overall activity of fleroxacin was similar to that of enoxacin and less than that of a-56620 and ciprofloxacin.
in vitro studies of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240), a new trifluorinated quinolone derivative.
the in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240) against 441 bacterial isolates was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxycillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was used for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). ciprofloxacin showed the highest activity against the enterobacteriaceae, 95% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l, but fleroxacin and ofloxacin were also highly active (mic 90% = 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). ciprofloxacin was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic 90% = 0.12 mg/l), whereas the activities of fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. tobramycin was highly active against p. aeruginosa, 75% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l or less. the quinolones and tobramycin exhibited high activity against acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the great majority of the isolates being susceptible to 0.5 mg/l or less of any agent. all the quinolones showed high activity against staphylococcus aureus, but fleroxacin was less active against staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus saprophyticus than were the other derivatives. the pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates were markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones tested (mic range 4-32 mg/l). all isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by the lowest concentration of the quinolones employed in the study (0.03 mg/l). cefuroxime was also highly active against n. gonorrhoeae, whether the strains were beta-lactamase-producing or not, but was somewhat less active against h. influenzae. the quinolones displayed moderate and similar activity against bacteroides fragilis isolates (mic range 1-16 mg/l). the mics of fleroxacin against gram-negative rods were generally 4-16 times higher at ph 8.8 than those obtained at ph 5.8 and 7.3. the activity against gram-positive cocci was not markedly influenced by changes in ph.
effect of temperature on antibacterial activity of lidocaine to staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the effect of temperature on the antibacterial activity of lidocaine to staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated in vitro. at 10 c at which s. aureus organisms do not grow and might be metabolically inactive, the antibacterial activity of lidocaine to s. aureus was not observed in a concentration of 1%, which was quite antibacterial to s. aureus at 37 c. on the other hand, at 40 c a conspicuously increased antibacterial activity to s. aureus of lidocaine was observed in a concentration of 0.25% which was not antibacterial to s. aureus organisms at 37 c. similar results were obtained when p. aeruginosa organisms were examined in place of s. aureus, although p. aeruginosa was found to be less susceptible to lidocaine than s. aureus. the clinical significance of the thermal effect on the antibacterial activity of lidocaine was discussed in brief.
the inhibitory effect of sodium alginate on antibiotic activity against mucoid and non-mucoid strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the exopolysaccharide of mucoid strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mpa) is chemically similar to alginate, a common polysaccharide of seaweeds. both polymers have been reported to decrease the diameter of the inhibition zones produced in antibiotic disc diffusion assays. in order to determine whether this phenomenon was due to reduced diffusion of the antibiotic in an agar matrix, or to inhibition of antibiotic activity by sodium alginate, we studied the effect of sodium alginate on the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa strains to antibiotics in disc diffusion assays, as well as in broth and agar dilution assays. sodium alginate decreased the activity of the aminoglycoside antibiotics, amikacin and gentamicin, against two mpa strains and their non-mucoid derivatives in each of the assays. in broth dilution assays, increase of the calcium ion concentration likewise reduced aminoglycoside activity against p. aeruginosa, but not against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. sodium alginate caused no inhibition of the activity of piperacillin and carbenicillin. the reduction of aminoglycoside activity may have implications for the common failure of these antibiotics in the treatment of pulmonary infections caused by mpa in cystic fibrosis patients, but must be considered only an in-vitro phenomenon at present.
survival of pathogenic bacteria in environmental microcosms.
the survival times of salmonella enteritidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and vibrio cholerae in natural soil and river water samples were monitored by using various differential media. s. aureus and v. cholerae failed to survive in samples of soil, groundwater, and river water with various degrees of eutrophication. the population of the introduced s. enteritidis remained fairly constant in all three samples of soils tested. in water samples, numbers of s. enteritidis and p. aeruginosa showed an initial rapid decline followed by a much lower rate of decrease. the results indicated that some allochthonous microorganisms, because of their insensitivity to various biotic and abiotic stresses, might persist for a long time in the environment and become a serious threat to public health.
[antimicrobial activity of sulbactam/cefoperazone. comparison with other new cephems].
antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) against 50 fresh clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared to those of cpz, cefotiam (ctm), cefotaxime (ctx) and latamoxef (lmox). minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of sbt and cpz mixed in a ratio of 1:1 were determined by the dilution method using mueller-hinton agar and expressed by absolute concentrations of cpz. antimicrobial activities of sbt/cpz against principally penicillinase (pcase) producing bacteria, i.e., s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, were superior to those of cpz alone. the presence of sbt in concentrations around 0.39 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml clearly enhanced cpz's antimicrobial activities against these pcase producing strains. the synergistic antimicrobial effects of sbt in combination with cpz were less pronounced against principally cephalosporinase (cepase) producing bacteria, i.e., c. freundii, enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris, and p. aeruginosa, and exerted with sbt at concentrations around 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml. comparative antimicrobial activities indicated by mic80's of tested agents showed that sbt/cpz had more stable activities against bacteria ranging from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria than ctm, ctx and lmox. mic's of sbt/cpz were higher than 25 micrograms/ml against 8% of s. aureus, 18% of c. freundii, 10% of enterobacter spp., 26% of s. marcescens, 2% of p. vulgaris, and 18% of p. aeruginosa. these resistant strains against which the addition of sbt showed no synergism, may possess other mechanism of resistance than beta-lactamase production. it is concluded that the presence of cpz resistant strains is an actual current problem and not an imaginary future problem, and that the number of resistant strains against other new cephems which have different chemical structure from cpz is increasing. when these present bacteriological environments are considered, the appearance of sbt/cpz in the clinical practice is timely and meaningful.
in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cl 118523, an aminothiazolyl iminomethoxy cephalosporin.
cl 118523 is an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin which contains a 1, 2, 3-thiadiazol  radical at position 3 of the cephem nucleus. it was as active as cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam against most enterobacteriaceae, mic 90% less than 1 mg/l, and more active, 8 to 32-fold, than cefoperazone and cefoxitin. enterobacter species resistant to the other agents were resistant to cl 118523. cl 118523 did not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, mic greater than 128 mg/l. it had excellent activity against hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, c, and g, and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but failed to inhibit enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. cl 118523 was minimally hydrolyzed by plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, and was a poor beta-lactamase inducer.
[pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of aspoxicillin in pediatric patients].
since the efficacy and the safety of aspoxicillin (aspc, ta-058) have been established on adult patients and the need of aspc use on pediatric patients was anticipated, we performed a 16 center study on the clinical utility of aspc in pediatric patients. 1. pharmacokinetics aspc was intravenously administered to 45 patients at a dose of 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg by one shot. serum concentrations of aspc were dependent of dose levels, and maximum levels of 58.4-230.8 micrograms/ml and half-lives (beta) of 1.08-1.16 hours were observed. urinary recovery rates were 62.7-67.2% in 6 hours. results obtained upon drip infusions (0.5-1 hour) were similar to one shot injections. 2. clinical results (1) clinical effectiveness of 318 evaluable patients including 175 boys and 143 girls, 18.2% were nurslings and 61% were young children under 4 years of age. one hundred eighty six patients from whom causative organisms were isolated were classified as a group. among them were 5 patients suffered with sepsis, but the aspc treatment eradicated all the bacteria but salmonella java in 1 case. all of 4 patients with meningitis were cured and all causative organisms (3 cases with haemophilus influenzae and 1 case with gram-positive coccus) were eradicated. cure rates were 90% for 130 patients with respiratory tract infection, 88.6% for 35 with urinary tract infection, 85.7% for 7 with skin soft tissue infection and 89.8% for all the a group patients. meanwhile, no causative organisms were isolated from 132 patients (b group patients) but cure rate of 91.7% was obtained for this group. no statistical difference was observed between a and b groups. for all the patients (318), the cure rate was 90.6%. (2) bacteriological effects of 63 gram-positive bacteria isolated as pathogens, 58 strains were eradicated. of 117 gram-negative bacterial, 101 were eradicated. the eradication rate on all 180 strains was 88.3%. overall, aspc showed excellent effects against streptococcus. among strains of staphylococcus aureus, 18 of 20 strains were eradicated. of 59 strains of h. influenzae, 52 were eradicated and 3 decreased. among strains of escherichia coli, 25 of 28 strains were eradicated. of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 strains were decreased and one was unchanged. (3) aspc was effective in 93.3% of 30 patients with serious infections and 79.2% of 72 patients with underlying diseases. cure rates for patients with and without underlying disease were significantly different statistically (chi 2: p less than 0.005).(abstract truncated at 400 words)
antimicrobial activity of tertiary amine covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber.
tertiary amine was covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber and examined for antibacterial activity. the tertiary amine covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber (taf) showed a high antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli. taf exhibited a stronger antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, and serratia marcescens) than against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis) or candida albicans. this activity against e. coli was accentuated by 0.1% deoxycholate or 10 mg of actinomycin d per ml, to which e. coli is normally not susceptible. this implies that taf causes an increase of the bacterial outer membrane permeability. on the other hand, the antimicrobial activity was inhibited by adding mg2+ or by lowering the ph. this suggest an electrostatic interaction between the bacterial cell wall and taf. scanning electron microscopy showed that e. coli cells were initially attached to taf, with many projections on the cell surface, but then were apparently lysed after contact for 4 h. taken together, these results imply that bacteria initially interact with taf by an electrostatic force between the anionic bacterial outer membrane and the cationic tertiary amine residues of taf and that longer contact with taf damages the bacterial outer membrane structure and increases its permeability.
pyridonecarboxylic acids as antibacterial agents. 9. synthesis and antibacterial  activity of 1-substituted 6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(4-pyridyl)-1,8-naphthyridine-3- carboxylic acids.
the title compounds (7a-e) with ethyl, 2-fluoroethyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, vinyl, or cyclopropyl groups, respectively, at c-1 were prepared by the method involving the balz-schiemann reaction of 2-(4-pyridyl)pyridine- and 7-(4-pyridyl)-1,8-naphthyridinediazonium tetrafluoroborates (15 and 27). the 1-ethyl, 1-(2-fluoroethyl), and 1-vinyl derivatives showed in vitro activities as potent as the corresponding 7-(1-piperazinyl) analogues against staphylococcus aureus 209p jc-1 and escherichia coli nihj jc-2 but were less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa 12. among the 7-(4-pyridyl) derivatives having the different c-1 substituent, 1-cyclopropyl derivative 7e was found to be the most active. in vivo efficacy of 7e was superior to that of enoxacin against experimental infections due to s. aureus 50774. some aspects of structure-activity relationships associated with the c-1, c-6, and c-7 substituents were discussed.
screening of antimicrobial activity of plants popularly used in guatemala for the treatment of dermatomucosal diseases.
ethnobotanical surveys were conducted among traditional healers and local market  vendors; about 200 plants used in guatemala for the treatment of dermatomucosal diseases were detected. by literature review and according to local availability, 89 plants were selected for in vitro screening for antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms usually causing skin and mucosal infections. ethanolic macerations were prepared and impregnated in absorbent paper; once dried, these were applied over standardized inocula of candida albicans, escherichia, coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. after incubation, inhibition zones were measured, demonstrating that 28 of the plants exhibited some in vitro inhibition of the tested microorganisms.
potential of topical norfloxacin therapy. comparative in vitro activity against clinical ocular bacterial isolates.
norfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic related to nalidixic acid, was evaluated as a topical agent for clinical efficacy in bacterial eye infections. this study reports on the comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin and ten topical antibiotics (nalidixic acid, polymyxin b, colistin, bacitracin, chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, and tobramycin) against 203 pathogenic eye isolates of 17 genera (37 species). in general, norfloxacin had the greatest potency and broadest spectrum of activity of the agents tested. it was active against staphylococcus aureus (minimal inhibitory concentration against 90% [mic90], less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml), coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90, less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml), and haemophilus organisms (mic90, less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml).
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
cs-807 is a new oral prodrug of r-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to r-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. ninety percent or more of pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus spp., providencia rettgeri, and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of staphylococcus epidermidis, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to r-3746. the activity of r-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. r-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of r-3746 at concentrations above the mic. r-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of staphylococcus aureus and 1a, 1bs, and 3 of escherichia coli. systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of cs-807.
efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of serious respiratory infections.
fifty-two patients with serious respiratory infections were treated with orally administered ciprofloxacin; 42 patients were evaluable for the efficacy analysis and all were evaluable for determining adverse reactions. cures were achieved in 24 patients with infections (14 with bronchitis, 10 with pneumonia) caused by hemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, or branhamella catarrhalis, and pathogens were rapidly eradicated from respiratory secretions. seventeen patients had infections (seven bronchitis, 10 pneumonia) caused by enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa; many of these patients were critically ill and were enrolled in the study because their pathogens were resistant to multiple drugs or because their infections had not responded to alternate antimicrobial therapy. all patients had favorable clinical responses, and members of the enterobacteriaceae were rapidly eradicated from respiratory secretions. however, five of 12 strains of p. aeruginosa persisted during treatment; minimal inhibitory concentrations for these strains increased 4- to 16-fold as infections continued to resolve. one patient with staphylococcus aureus infection also showed a response. ciprofloxacin probably caused nausea, vomiting, or both in three of the 52 patients and possibly contributed to similar symptoms in another three patients (6 to 12 percent). other possible adverse reactions, including central nervous system symptoms, were also observed but were not clearly drug-related.
randomized study of two dosage regimens of ciprofloxacin for treating chronic bronchopulmonary infection in patients with cystic fibrosis.
twenty-nine adult patients with cystic fibrosis who had chronic bronchopulmonary  infection were randomly assigned to receive 750 or 1,000 mg of oral ciprofloxacin every 12 hours for two weeks. assessments for efficacy and safety were made on treatment days 7 and 14 and one week following completion of therapy, and pharmacokinetic data were collected on days 1, 7, and 14. fifteen of 28 evaluable patients showed clinical improvement, and none had clinical deterioration. the higher dosage of ciprofloxacin did not enhance the clinical response. statistically significant, stepwise changes in clinical scores, pulmonary function, and sputum concentrations of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus were noted, but regression toward initial values occurred by one week after treatment. although all p. aeruginosa isolates were initially inhibited by 2 mg/liter of ciprofloxacin or less, 45 and 35 percent of isolates were resistant after 14 days of therapy and one week later, respectively. outpatient oral ciprofloxacin therapy was commonly associated with clinical improvement in adult patients with cystic fibrosis who have chronic bronchopulmonary infection, regardless of the emergence of resistant p. aeruginosa, and adverse reactions were infrequent. further studies must delineate the long-term consequences of the frequent emergence of bacterial resistance.
evaluation of ciprofloxacin's synergism with other agents by multiple in vitro methods.
the efficacies of ciprofloxacin, ceftizoxime, azlocillin, mezlocillin, and amikacin (minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration) against six pseudomonas aeruginosa, six enterobacteriaceae, and six group d streptococcal strains were evaluated using both agar and broth susceptibility methods, two inoculum sizes (5.7 log10 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml and 7.7 log10 cfu/ml), and aerobic and anaerobic incubation conditions. the results showed agreement between broth and agar methods of susceptibility determination; inoculum effects with beta-lactam antimicrobials; and decreased susceptibility to amikacin under anaerobiasis. ciprofloxacin combined with azlocillin, ceftizoxime, or aminoglycosides in broth microdilution checkerboards against 100 gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci demonstrated that ciprofloxacin combined with azlocillin or ceftizoxime was synergistic against at least 50 percent of p. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens isolates and that ciprofloxacin combined with amikacin was synergistic against at least 50 percent of s. marcescens and staphylococcus aureus isolates. ciprofloxacin and azlocillin in combination were evaluated by microdilution checkerboard, agar dilution, and broth macrodilution time-kill methods at two inoculum sizes to assess antibacterial activity. comparison between in vitro combination methods showed the following: the presence or absence of checkerboard synergism (as defined by the fractional inhibitory concentration index and the fractional bactericidal concentration index) with ciprofloxacin and azlocillin did not correlate with time-kill results; and good agreement between methods when comparing broth macrodilution time-kill (3 log10 cfu/ml or more decrease) with antimicrobial combinations at a single concentration in both agar and microdilution broth for ciprofloxacin and azlocillin. rabbit studies using subcutaneous dialysis membrane chambers inoculated with six p. aeruginosa, six enterobacteriaceae, and six group d streptococcal strains were performed using ciprofloxacin, azlocillin, ceftizoxime, and amikacin alone and in combination as therapy. in vitro testing of antibiotic combinations that provided the best prediction of in vivo outcome were combination antibacterial activity (3 log10 cfu/ml or more decrease) at 24 hours using either broth macrodilution time-kill or antimicrobial combinations at a single concentration in either agar or broth (microdilution). for the most efficacious in vivo combination, ciprofloxacin plus azlocillin, there was in vitro correlation with in vivo outcome for 17 of 18 isolates.
synergism of the combinations of imipenem plus ciprofloxacin and imipenem plus amikacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacterial pathogens.
the combinations of imipenem plus ciprofloxacin and imipenem plus amikacin were investigated for their activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacterial pathogens. for imipenem-susceptible p. aeruginosa, synergy of imipenem plus ciprofloxacin and imipenem plus amikacin was observed against 36 and 45% of the strains, respectively. the incidence of synergy against imipenem-resistant isolates of p. aeruginosa was 10% for both combinations. antagonism was not observed with either combination.
effect of agitation and frequent subculturing on recovery of aerobic and facultative pathogens by roche septi-chek and bactec blood culture systems.
the positivity rate and time to recovery of pathogens were compared in roche septi-chek (rsc-tsb) and bactec radiometric systems on 3,539 paired blood cultures. both systems were steadily agitated, with frequent subculturing or processing of the rsc-tsb agar slides and bactec bottles, respectively, during the first 24 h of incubation. the rsc-tsb system recovered 249 pathogens (7.0% positivity rate), compared with 234 (6.6% positivity rate) isolates recovered from bactec. for the most common isolates, staphylococcus aureus and the enterobacteriaceae, the median time to detection was 15.8 h for bactec and 18.6 h for the rsc-tsb system. no statistically significant difference was observed in recovery of organisms from the two systems, except for s. aureus (p less than 0.05). in the rsc-tsb system, 42% of s. aureus, 58% of the enterobacteriaceae, and 45% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had sufficient growth on the agar slant to allow performance of rapid standardized identification and susceptibility studies. in comparison with other studies using static incubation, it appears that agitation and frequent subculturing of the rsc-tsb system during the first 24 h of incubation decreased the time to detection for the majority of significant blood culture isolates.
[clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
norfloxacin: clinical pharmacology and clinical use.
norfloxacin, a nalidixic acid analog, is the first of the fluorinated quinolinecarboxylic acids to be marketed in the united states. it demonstrates potent antibacterial activity against aerobic, gram-negative bacteria including the enterobacteriaceae, gentamicin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, and penicillin-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae. norfloxacin exhibits good activity against methicillin-resistant and -sensitive staphylococcus aureus, but less activity against most other aerobic, gram-positive organisms. anaerobic bacteria are resistant to the drug. resistance to norfloxacin is not plasmid mediated, but is secondary to bacterial mutation, and occurs less frequently than nalidixic acid resistance. its pharmacokinetic properties after a 400-mg oral dose consist of a peak serum concentration of 1.3-1.58 micrograms/ml, an elimination half-life of 3-7 hours, and good penetration into kidney and prostatic tissues. renal excretion is the major route of elimination. norfloxacin is highly effective in the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections, and gonococcal urethritis. adverse effects are generally well tolerated and usually do not require discontinuation of therapy.
[antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from surgical infections (first report)].
in vitro activities of several antimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with primary and postoperative infections were investigated in 1982 and 1983. antimicrobial agents examined were as follows: sulbenicillin (sbpc), piperacillin (pipc), cephalothin (cet), cefazolin (cez), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm), cefoperazone (cpz), cefotaxime (ctx), ceftizoxime (czx), cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), lincomycin (lcm), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk). specimens for bacterial isolation included plus, fluid drawn by centesis, or bile. blood samples of septicemia were excluded. the antimicrobial activities of these drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution method of the japanese society of chemotherapy. there were 123 strains obtained in the 1982 survey and 252 strains in the 1983 survey. little or no differences were seen in frequencies of isolation between the isolates of principal species in 1982 and those in 1983. isolation frequencies of pathogens in primary infections were, in an order of decreasing frequency, e. coli (25.6%), anaerobes (21.1%), streptococcus sp. (14.3%), staphylococcus sp. (11.3%); in postoperative infections, streptococcus sp. was most frequent (28.6%), followed by pseudomonas sp. (17.6%), anaerobes (12.6%), e. coli (10.9%), staphylococcus (10.1%). against s. aureus, cez, ctm, lcm and gm had similar degree of activity with cet being somewhat more active. cmx was the most active drug among the third generation cephems tested against s. aureus. no strain was ctm, cez, and lcm-resistant at the same time. over 90% of e. coli, were sensitive to ctx, czx and cmx, inhibited by 0.10 microgram/ml, while e. coli were slightly less susceptible to cpz and lmox. penicillins were not very active against k. pneumoniae, and only 60% of k. pneumoniae were inhibited by pipc at concentrations of 12.5 micrograms/ml. third generation cephems, ctx, cmx and czx, proved highly active against k. pneumoniae; over 90% of k. pneumoniae was inhibited by ctx, cmx and czx at a concentration of 0.10 microgram/ml. about 60% of p. aeruginosa was inhibited by 3.13 micrograms/ml of pipc and gm but was resistant to sbpc. this survey should be very useful for the selection of an appropriate drug for prophylaxis if the frequencies of incidences of pathogens in postoperative infections are taken into account in selecting the most active antibiotic agent(s) against the most frequent genus, genera and species of pathogens.
population analysis of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid in staphylococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae.
susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (cfl) and nalidixic acid (nal) was tested in vitro by means of the population analysis technique against six strains of staphylococcus, one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and seven strains from five genera of enterobacteriaceae. all strains of staphylococcus were uniformly resistant to nal as was the pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, all bacteria being resistant to 250- less than 500 micrograms/ml. the enterobacteriaceae were heterogeneous as regards susceptibility to nal. with some strains minority populations of highly-resistant bacteria could be detected with frequencies of about 10(-6.3). the mic for cfl for the staphylococci varied between 0.25 and 0.50 microgram/ml. there were no differences in mic of penicillinase-producing and penicillin-susceptible strains, either in staphylococcus aureus or in staphylococcus epidermidis. the mic for cfl in the enterobacteria varied between 0.004 and 0.03 microgram/ml. the mic for cfl in the pseudomonas aeruginosa was 0.25 microgram/ml. mic for cfl increased in all strains when the parental strains were compared to bacteria selected from the plates with the highest concentration permitting growth, indicating heterogeneity against cfl. but while the mic of the selected enterobacteria were lower than one fourth of the level obtainable in serum, the mic of the selected staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa were either exceeding the level obtainable in serum or were only a little lower than this level. while cfl thus seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent in the treatment of infections caused by enterobacteria, the suitability for infections caused by staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa should be further explored.
characterization of a protein from normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes with bactericidal activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
purification of a bactericidal protein (bp) from the cytoplasmic granules of normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) with activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa is described. bactericidal activity from acid extracts of a mixed granule population was purified 175-fold by a two-step chromatographic procedure. the first step, dye-ligand affinity chromatography with matrex-gel orange a, was followed by cation-exchange chromatography with bio-rex 70 resin, and this combination routinely gave a yield near 80%. only one peak of bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa type i was found after each chromatographic step. characterization of bp showed a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. purified bp was most active against the six strains of p. aeruginosa tested and against escherichia coli b (a deep rough mutant). purified bp killed 5 x 10(6) cfu of p. aeruginosa type i per ml at a concentration of 60 to 80 ng/ml. proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus were both resistant to the bactericidal activity of bp. bp was shown to be glycosylated by periodic acid staining after gel electrophoresis and to have an isoelectric point near 7.5 by chromatofocusing. the amino acid composition of bp is presented.
[a clinical bacteriological efficacy study on a fosfomycin otic solution].
fosfomycin (fom) otic solution was administered to 587 patients with suppurative  otitis media infections including 190 patients in the dose-establishment test, 126 patients in the open clinical trial and 271 patients in the double blind test. various bacteria were detected in the 549 cases in which bacteriological investigation was possible. main bacteria detected from the above cases were s. aureus (261 strains, 47.5%), p. aeruginosa (93 strains, 16.9%), coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) (89 strains, 16.2%), providencia spp. (35 strains, 6.4%) and proteus spp. (28 strains, 5.1%). twenty-seven strains of anaerobic bacteria (4.9%) were also detected. the mic of fom, and the reference drug, chloramphenicol (cp), fradiomycin (frm), cefmenoxime (cmx) and cephalexin (cex), were determined up to a concentration of 800 micrograms/ml with inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) cfu/ml. about 30% of s. aureus was multi-drug resistant, including methicillin and cephems, but fom showed excellent antibacterial activity against it. the fom had superior antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa to cp, frm and cmx, and was also active against other bacteria. the antibacterial activity of fom was inferior to other drugs against cns, enterobacter spp., p. putida and p. cepacia. the detection rate of these bacteria, however, was low and since their role as causative organisms is not well defined, the inferior activity of fom has no effect on the bacteriological evaluation of fom. since the concentration in the tympanic cavity about 1 hour after the administration of 3% fom solution was estimated to be 2,000 to 3,000 micrograms/ml, it could be presumed that bacteria inhibited by 800 micrograms/ml of fom at an inoculum size of 10(8) cfu/ml would be eradicable. the low ototoxicity of fom is likely due to its characteristic as an inhibitor of bacterial cell wall synthesis. from these results, 3% fom otic solution may be considered as a remarkably useful topical preparation for the treatment of suppurative otitis media.
sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
comparative "in vitro" activity of ciprofloxacin (bay o9867) and other antimicrobial agents against urinary bacterial isolates.
ciprofloxacin (bay o9867) is a new quinolone derivative. its activity against 537 urinary bacterial isolates was compared with those of ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, nalidixic and oxolinic acids, norfloxacin, trimethoprim, and other antimicrobial agents, when appropriate. it inhibited 90% of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., e. coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp., and serratia spp. at 0.78 microgram/ml. the majority of pseudomonas aeruginosa, including gentamicin-resistant strains, was inhibited by 0.78 microgram/ml. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin for 90% of staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus faecalis were 0.78 microgram/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml respectively. ciprofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, nalidixic and oxolinic acids, and trimethoprim. ciprofloxacin was less active in urine at ph 5.8 than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. there was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. spontaneous rates of mutation to resistance of representative urinary bacteria were studied. for ciprofloxacin these rates ranged from 8.2 x 10(-9) to 1.5 x 10(-11).
in vitro activity of ro 23-6240, a new difluoroquinolone derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
ro 23-6240 is a new difluorinated quinolone antimicrobial agent. its in vitro activity against a wide range of bacteria was compared with those of other quinolones and beta-lactams. generally, members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by low concentrations of ro 23-6240 (mic90 [mic for 90% of isolates tested], less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml). ninety percent of staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) and neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) showed intermediate susceptibility, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) was less susceptible. strains resistant to nalidixic acid were less susceptible to all the quinolones tested. the protein binding of ro 23-6240 (5 micrograms/ml) was 27%.
in vitro activity of ro 15-8074 and ro 19-5247, two orally administered cephalosporin metabolites.
the activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, ro 15-8074 and ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. both were highly active (mic for 90% of the strains tested [mic 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. there was no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against morganella morganii (in the case of ro 15-8074), enterobacter sp., and citrobacter sp. staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to ro 19-5247 (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), but ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. the protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for ro 19-5247. the major target site for the two cephalosporins was pbp 3.
activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
the in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. mic90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. all strains except escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. pefloxacin was highly active against staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; mic90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). with bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and b. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l) gave variable results. amongst genitourinary isolates, neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but gardnerella vaginalis (25) and mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). pefloxacin was more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. no enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones, whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.
timentin and beta-lactamases.
ticarcillin is resistant to the action of cephalosporinases, which explains its biological activity on a large number of bacterial species, including cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. nevertheless, its antibacterial activity is often limited by the action of some beta-lactamases, mostly plasmid-mediated penicillinases. clavulanic acid by itself has poor antibacterial activity, but its most important property is to inhibit and inactivate beta-lactamases. the inhibitory properties of clavulanic acid were studied on a large number of beta-lactamases. the penicillinases produced by staphylococcus aureus, the plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the tem-type, the chromosomally-mediated penicillinases from klebsiella pneumoniae and other closely-related beta-lactamases, and a few chromosomally-mediated cephalosporinases, such as that produced by proteus vulgaris, are powerfully inhibited by clavulanic acid. the plasmid-mediated penicillinases of oxa type and most of the chromosomally-mediated cephalosporinases, such as that produced by escherichia coli (amp c), are less or poorly inhibited. moreover, clavulanic acid has some cephalosporinase-inducing properties. these properties are in good agreement with the bacteriological properties of timentin.
[in-vitro activity of cefonicid on hospital bacteria. regression line and proposal for critical values].
antimicrobial activity of cefonicid, a new second generation cephalosporin, against 315 hospital isolates (4th trimester 1984) was investigated. e. coli and proteus mirabilis were the most susceptible species. all e. coli strains except one were inhibited at 8 mg/l (modal mic: 0.5); mics of all indole + proteus were 8 mg/l (modal mic: 0.06). another group was moderately susceptible: mics of klebsiella and citrobacter ranged from 0.12 to 128 mg/l, but mics of 50% of these strains were less than or equal to 4 mg/l; mic was less than or equal to 8 mg/l for 75% of indole + proteus and providencia strains; tested proteus vulgaris were especially resistant (mics greater than 128 mg/l). most enterobacter and serratia strains showed little susceptibility (modal mic for both species greater than or equal to 128 mg/l). mics of all tested pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were greater than 128 mg/l. 20 of the 24 tested acinetobacter strains had a mic of greater than or equal to 128 mg/l. for staphylococcus aureus, 88% of methicillin-sensitive strains were inhibited by concentrations of 2 to 4 mg/l whereas methicillin-resistant strains were resistant to cefonicid (75%: mic greater than 64 mg/l). enterococci were resistant to cefonicid. a correlation curve was established (enterobacteria and staphylococci). on the basis of cefonicid's pharmacokinetic characteristics, critical concentrations are proposed.
[in-vivo bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of pefloxacine].
after oral ingestion of pefloxacin (400 mg every 12 hours for four days), the following characteristics were studied: bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of urine for controls free of urinary tract infection on 6 "test" strains; kinetics of bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of urine as compared to serum in patients with urinary tract infection. the urinary bacteriostatic level approximates bactericidal levels in healthy individuals. this level, that varies across bacterial species, remains steady between the third hour and the twenty-fourth hour following initiation of treatment: values found were 1/16 to 1/8192 for enterobacteria, 1/64 to 1/256 for pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1/256 to 1/512 for staphylococcus aureus. in patients, urinary killing curves show that bacteriuria decreases by 5 log10 approximately, starting at the third hour. urine was sterile by the sixth hour. in most cases, serum bacteriostatic activity was above 1/32 throughout treatment, with maximum levels being recorded on the fourth day (above 1/64). bactericidal activity is similar to bacteriostatic activity.
the activity of bmy 28142 a new broad spectrum beta-lactamase stable cephalosporin.
the in-vitro activity of bmy 28142, an iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin containing a methyl pyrrolidinio c-3 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem and tobramycin against various bacteria. bmy 28142 was the most active agent tested against the enterobacteriaceae inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. the in-vitro activity of bmy 28142 was equal to or superior to cefotaxime against the highly susceptible members of the enterobacteriaceae and several-fold superior to ceftazidime and aztreonam. bmy 28142 inhibited many enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. bmy 28142 was more active than imipenem against proteus, providencia and morganella species. ceftazidime and imipenem were more active than bmy 28142 against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it inhibited piperacillin and tobramycin-resistant isolates. bmy 28142 inhibited beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. bmy 28142 was more active than ceftazidime against streptococcal and staphylococcal species, but it did not inhibit or kill most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. bmy 28142 did not inhibit most bacteroides species. bmy 28142 was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it bound poorly to enterobacter beta-lactamase, was a poor inhibitor of the tem plasmid beta-lactamase and was a poor inducer of beta-lactamases.
in vitro antibacterial activity of enoxacin (ci-919).
antibacterial activity of enoxacin was evaluated against more than 3,700 clinical isolates using the agar-dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4)-10(5) cells per site. for comparison other antibiotics appropriate for each species were also included. for most enterobacteria and for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic90 of enoxacin was below 2 mg/l. serratia marcescens was more resistant; the mic90 being 4 mg/ml. enoxacin also showed high activity against campylobacter jejuni and neisseria gonorrhoeae. streptococci were comparatively resistant, 32 mg/l to 64 mg/l of the compound being required to inhibit 90% of strains.
in vitro activity of ro 23-6240, a new fluorinated 4-quinolone.
the in vitro activity of ro 23-6240 (am833), 6,8-difluoro-1-(2-fluoroethyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7(4-methyl-1-piper azinyl) quinolone-3-carboxylic acid, was compared with those of norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. ro 23-6240 inhibited the majority of enterobacteriaceae isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml. it was especially active against shigella sp., salmonella sp., escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica, with an mic for 90% of the strains of less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. the mic for 90% of the strains was 1 microgram/ml for serratia marcescens and 8 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa. staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant strains, were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. streptococcal and anaerobic species were inhibited by 8 to 16 micrograms/ml. ro 23-6240 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing bacteria resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. the overall activity of ro 23-6240 was similar to those of enoxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. the frequency of spontaneous resistance was low, although resistant bacteria could be isolated by repeated subculture. the activity of ro 23-6240 was decreased in the presence of magnesium at concentrations similar to those present in urine.
use of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.
the therapeutic efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin was studied in 30 patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. in 20 patients ciprofloxacin was given alone and in 10 patients (including 8 compromised hosts) in combination with an aminoglycoside (9) or azlocillin (1). ciprofloxacin was given in doses of 500 mg orally or 200-300 mg i.v. every 12 h. in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin clinical cure with eradication of bacteria was obtained in 15 patients (75%) with infections of bone and joint (6), skin and soft tissue (4), lung (2), middle ear (2) and csf (1). two patients with lymphoma and pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia died. in patients receiving combination therapy a definite therapeutic success was achieved in four (40%). three patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia died. in seven patients nine bacterial strains with decreasing susceptibility of ciprofloxacin (increase in mic from less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml to 2-16 micrograms/ml) were selected (6 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 1 serratia marcescens, 1 staphylococcus aureus). ciprofloxacin was well tolerated. this new quinolone seems to be suitable for single drug treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in patients with normal host defense mechanisms, while its therapeutic potential in compromised hosts requires further evaluation.
[in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections to beta-lactam antibiotics].
in vitro susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens to beta-lactam antibiotics were  determined. bacterial pathogens examined included various isolates from the patients of respiratory tract infections at the hospitals of kyoto-shiga area in 1981 and 1983. major organisms isolated from clinical specimens were haemophilus spp., klebsiella spp., pseudomonas spp., s. aureus and streptococcus spp. an increase in the isolation frequency of p. aeruginosa, a decrease in the isolation frequency of h. influenzae and no change in the isolation frequency of the other organisms were observed between the years 1981 and 1983. data from susceptibility tests of clinical isolates confirmed that cefazolin (cez) and cefotiam (ctm) showed good antibacterial activity against s. aureus and cefmenoxime (cmx) was highly effective on streptococcus spp., but that the susceptibilities of both organisms to cez, ctm, and cefmetazole (cmz) in 1983 were lower than in 1981. although cmx also showed good antibacterial activity against klebsiella spp., there were no changes in the effectiveness of ctm, cmz, and cez between the years 1981 and 1983. the in vitro antibacterial activities of cmx and cefoperazone against haemophilus spp. were superior to those of the other beta-lactams tested, but there was a decline in the efficacy for cez. although cefsulodin and piperacillin were highly active against pseudomonas spp., declines in their effectiveness was observed between the years 1981 and 1983.
antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of sk&f 88070 compared with other agents.
the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of sk&f 88070 (7-[[2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]-3-[[ [1-(2-sulfaminoethyl)-1h-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]-3- cephem-4-carboxylic acid) a new parenteral cephalosporin was investigated against 780 types of bacteria. sk&f 88070 inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, shigella species, morganella morganii, and citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. its activity against these species was similar to cefotaxime and moxalactam and superior to cefoperazone and piperacillin. it was less active than cefoperazone against pseudomonas aeruginosa and less active than cefotaxime or cefoperazone against staphylococcus aureus. sk&f 88070 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. enterobacter species, citrobacter freundii, and serratia, which were resistant to cefotaxime and moxalactam were resistant to sk&f 88070. it was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by the proteus vulgaris type 1c enzyme. sk&f 88070 inhibited richmond-sykes type 1a beta-lactamases.
in vitro evaluation of a-56619 (difloxacin) and a-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
the in vitro antibacterial potencies of a-56619 and a-56620, two new aryl-fluoroquinolones, were compared with the potency of norfloxacin against a broad spectrum of organisms. cefotaxime, aztreonam, piperacillin, imipenem, penicillin, and gentamicin were also tested for reference purposes. the mics required to inhibit at least 90% of the strains tested ranged from 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml for a-56619 and from 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for a-56620 for members of the enterobacteriaceae. a-56619 was generally twofold less potent and a-56620 was twofold more potent than norfloxacin against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including members of the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. against indole-positive proteus, morganella, providencia rettgeri, and serratia strains, a-56619 was at least 8- to 16-fold less potent than norfloxacin. a-56619 and a-56620 were four- to eightfold more potent than norfloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and equally potent to fourfold more potent against streptococcus species, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the mics of a-56619 and a-56620 were only slightly affected by increased inoculum size or by the addition of various cations at physiologic concentrations. a-56619 was three- to fivefold less active at ph 8.0 than at ph 6.5 or 7.2. a-56620 was twofold less active at ph 6.5 than at ph 8.0 or 7.2 against members of the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa; similar ph variations did not affect a-56620 activity against gram-positive cocci. the potencies of a-56619, a-56620, and norfloxacin were less in urine than in mueller-hinton broth; however, this effect was more pronounced with norfloxacin. human serum at a concentration of 50% caused a 4- to 64- fold decrease in the potency of a-56619 and an average 4-fold decrease in the potency of a-56620, compared with no effect on the potency of norfloxacin. a-56619, a-56620, and norfloxacin were bactericidal and, at four times the mic, reduced the viable cell counts of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa by approximately 99.9% within 2 h. a-56619, a-56620, and norfloxacin showed no significant synergistic activity and no antagonism when they were aminoglycoside or beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
in vitro activity of cefpirome (hr810) against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including organisms with inducible resistance.
the activity of cefpirome (hr810) was compared with seven beta-lactam antibiotics against selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. cefpirome was the most active antibiotic tested against all groups of enterobacteriaceae; 46% of the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml of cefpirome. fifty percent of the oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates and 82% of the streptococcus faecalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml of cefpirome. all enterobacteriaceae and two of five p. aeruginosa isolates that were induced to produce beta-lactamase by prior exposure to cefoxitin remained susceptibile to cefpirome.
defensins. natural peptide antibiotics of human neutrophils.
we extracted a granule-rich sediment from normal human neutrophils and subjected  it to chromatographic, electrophoretic, and functional analysis. the extract contained three small (molecular weight less than 3,500) antibiotic peptides that were named human neutrophil peptide (hnp)-1, hnp-2, and hnp-3, and which will be referred to as "defensins." hnp 1-3, a mixture of the three defensins, killed staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli effectively in vitro when tested in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing certain nutrients, but it had little or no bactericidal activity in nutrient-free buffer. in contrast, the nutrient-free buffer supported a high degree of activity by hnp 1-3 against cryptococcus neoformans. in addition to its antibacterial and antifungal properties, hnp 1-3 directly inactivated herpes simplex virus, type 1. two of the individual purified defensins, hnp-1 and hnp-2, were as microbicidal as the mixture hnp 1-3. hnp-3 was less active than the other defensins against most but not all of the microbes tested. immunoperoxidase stains revealed hnp 1-3 to have a granular localization in the neutrophil's cytoplasm by light microscopy. frozen thin section immunogold transmission electron microscopy showed hnp 1-3 to be localized in azurophil granules. these studies define a broad-spectrum antimicrobial system in human neutrophils. the defensin system may operate in conjunction with or independently from oxygen-dependent microbicidal processes to enable human neutrophils to inactivate and destroy potential pathogens.
[antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment].
this study was carried out to understand the antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment in boiling water. the samples included the core and the outer layers of onion, the white and the green parts of green onion, garlic bulb, ginger, ginger root, sweet pepper, chili pepper, brown pepper, and mustard. the test microorganisms included escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio parahaemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium phlei, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, and micrococcus luteus. raw garlic bulb could inhibit all of the test strains. the antibacterial activities of green onion are slightly weak than that of onion. however, green onion could inhibit p. aeruginosa and m. luteus, but onion could inhibit e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. faecalis, and b. cereus. ginger and ginger root could only inhibit m. luteus. chili pepper could inhibit v. parahaemolyticus and p. vulgaris. brown pepper could also inhibit p. vulgaris. sweet pepper and mustard showed no antibacterial activity to all of the test strains. in general, antibacterial components in the spice plants were heat labile. all the spices tested lost their antibacterial activities within 20 min at 100 degrees c.
growth of bacteria in enteral feeding solutions.
solutions of clinifeed iso, triosorbon, vivonex standard (full- and half-strength) and vivonex hn were experimentally contaminated with two strains each of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) organisms/ml. samples were incubated at 4, 25 or 37 degrees c and viable counts were made at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. no increase in numbers of any of the organisms was observed in any of the feeds during 24 h at 4 degrees c. all organisms multiplied rapidly in clinifeed iso and in triosorbon at 25 and 37 degrees c. there was less rapid growth in half-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, although at 37 degrees c all strains multiplied rapidly except for the two s. aureus strains, the growth of which was inhibited in half-strength vivonex standard at both 25 and 37 degrees c. in full-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, only p. aeruginosa showed any increase in numbers during 24 h, whereas p. aeruginosa, k. aerogenes and e. cloacae all multiplied at 37 degrees c. none of the test organisms multiplied in full strength vivonex hn at any of the temperatures studied. the results of the study show that bacteria survive and may multiply even in feeds with low ph and high osmolarity, and emphasise the importance of strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feeds.
antibacterial activity of imipenem: the first thienamycin antibiotic.
imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin) is the first representative of a new class of beta-lactam antibiotics--the carbapenems. imipenem has an unusually broad spectrum, high potency, and no cross-resistance with other beta-lactam antibiotics. susceptible gram-negative species include pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, and enterobacter. activity is high against staphylococcus aureus, most group d streptococci, and staphylococcus epidermidis but is variable against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. imipenem is more active against bacteroides than are other beta-lactam agents, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, and clindamycin. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 98% of 30,655 isolates--excluding those of the three resistant species (pseudomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas cepacia, and streptococcus faecium)--were less than 8 micrograms/ml, the susceptibility breakpoint adopted for clinical trials. imipenem is bactericidal (minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs] less than twice the mics). for p. aeruginosa, mbcs of imipenem are less influenced by high inoculum density rather than are mbcs of antipseudomonal penicillins and cephalosporins. stability of imipenem to diverse classes of plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases accounts for its lack of cross-resistance with other beta-lactam antibiotics. imipenem is also active against p. aeruginosa with non-lactamase-mediated resistance to classical beta-lactam agents. efficacy of imipenem was shown in animal models, including septicemia in normal and neutropenic rodents and p. aeruginosa pneumonia. imipenem also has a unique postantibiotic effect against p. aeruginosa in vivo.
comparative in vitro inhibitory and killing activity of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime against pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant and tolerant and nontolerant staphylococcus aureus.
with a macrotube dilution method, mics and mbcs were determined for three aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, cefpirome (hr 810), ceftazidime, and cefotaxime, against pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant, -susceptible, and -tolerant strains of staphylococcus aureus. comparatively, cefpirome was the most active agent against all gram-positive cocci, including enterococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and was as active as ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. mbcs of cefpirome were within two dilutions of the mics for 91% of p. aeruginosa and 90% of gram-positive cocci strains tested, except methicillin-resistant s. aureus, for which the mbcs were within three dilutions for 90% of strains.
carbapenems: special properties contributing to their activity.
imipenem is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits most clinical isolates of staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae, and streptococci, excluding enterococci, at 1 microgram/ml or less. resistance can develop in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, albeit infrequently. pseudomonas maltophilia is intrinsically resistant to imipenem. many strains of enterobacter cloacae, clostridium freundii, and s. marcescens resistant to the aminothiazolyl cephalosporins are susceptible to imipenem, but tend to have higher minimal inhibitory concentrations. in general, imipenem inhibits organisms resistant to other beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. imipenem binds to pbp-2 and rapidly kills most bacteria which it inhibits. imipenem is highly stable against attack by beta-lactamases of both plasmid and chromosomal origin, and is more stable by several thousand-fold than earlier beta-lactamase stable compounds. it acts as a suicide inhibitor of beta-lactamases. imipenem does induce beta-lactamases, but the activity of imipenem against isolates containing induced beta-lactamases is not decreased and it appears not to be susceptible to the trapping that occurs with some of the cephalosporins. imipenem acts synergistically with aminoglycosides against a wide variety of bacteria, but this is most readily demonstrated for streptococcus faecalis, s. aureus, and p. aeruginosa organisms which show a difference between inhibition and killing. overall, the excellent activity of imipenem is the result of (1) the lack of a permeability barrier; (2) high affinity for pbp-2, a critical protein in cell wall synthesis in gram-negative bacteria, and for critical penicillin-binding proteins of gram-positive species; and, above all, (3) its great beta-lactamase stability.
potential of imipenem as single-agent empiric antibiotic therapy of febrile neutropenic patients with cancer.
infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality for the patient with cancer who experiences episodes of severe granulocytopenia. the search continues for new antimicrobial agents with improved efficacy and lower incidence of toxicity. imipenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic which possesses a broad antibacterial spectrum with excellent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and the other commonly recovered enteric gram-negative bacilli that infect the granulocytopenic patient with cancer. the combination of imipenem plus an aminoglycoside has shown in vitro synergy against p. aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus whereas the combination of imipenem plus piperacillin or the extended spectrum cephalosporins have frequently shown antagonism when tested against p. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. the use of a p. aeruginosa-infected neutropenic rat model has provided an in vivo system to evaluate the activity of new antibiotics or antibiotic combinations. monotherapy with imipenem is as effective in this model as any of the currently available synergistic antibiotic combinations. this degree of activity has not been found with other broad-spectrum antibiotics when used alone. imipenem provides serum bactericidal activity well above a 1:8 dilution for the four most commonly isolated pathogens: p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and s. aureus. in addition, imipenem's post-antibiotic effect against p. aeruginosa may be pertinent. imipenem is a unique antibiotic, with properties that make it well suited for study as monotherapy for fever and suspected infection in granulocytopenic patients with cancer. a prospective randomized, double-blind study comparing imipenem with a control regimen of piperacillin plus amikacin as empiric antibiotic therapy of febrile granulocytopenic patients with cancer is currently underway at the university of maryland cancer center.
the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome (hr 810), a pyridine cephalosporin agent active against staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new cyclopyridinium cephalosporin, was evaluated against 947 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. cefpirome inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, aeromonas spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp. and haemophilus and neisseria species at less than or equal to 0.4 mg/l. it had activity comparable to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and moxalactam against these species. only a few citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp. and serratia marcescens had mics above 3.1 mg/l. the activity of cefpirome against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% mic of 12.5 mg/l, was superior to piperacillin, moxalactam, cefotaxime and cefoperazone. the 90% mic against staphylococcus aureus was 0.8 mg/l, but methicillin-resistant staphylococci were not inhibited. cefpirome was not significantly hydrolyzed by most plasmid beta-lactamases (tem, shv-1, pse, oxa) nor by chromosomal enzymes (p99, branhamella catarrhalis, k1). cefpirome did not inhibit chromosomal or plasmid beta-lactamases. mice systemically infected with e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were protected by concentrations of cefpirome ranging from 0.85 mg/kg for k. pneumoniae to 4.467 mg/kg for p. aeruginosa.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
in vitro and in vivo activities of dn-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
dn-9550 [(6r, 7r)-7-[(z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1h-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the activity of dn-9550 against most species of the family enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens, dn-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. dn-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but dn-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to dn-9550, but bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. dn-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. when dn-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
hr 810 and bmy-28142, two new cephalosporins with broad-spectrum activity: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
the in-vitro activity of the new parenteral cephalosporins, hr 810 (hr) and bmy-28142 (bmy), was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefotaxime, against a total of 315 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. against all species of the enterobacteriaceae tested, both hr and bmy were as active as, or slightly more active than, cefotaxime. hr differed from cefotaxime mainly in being eight-fold more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and two-fold more active against staphylococcus aureus. bmy was also eight-fold more active than cefotaxime against ps. aeruginosa but was two-fold less active than the latter against staph. aureus. both new compounds had good activity against haemophilus influenzae, including the beta-lactamase producing strains of that species, and both had poor activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l).
dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. the disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the united states were compared. no significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus faecalis for this period; enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. slight increases in susceptibility were observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine.
antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine against 10 microbial strains was studied with an agar dilution method. the strains tested were escherichia coli (atcc 25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), and one of each of the clinical isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis (a multiresistant strain), staphylococcus epidermidis (a sensitive strain), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes (a), streptococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, and candida albicans. the antimicrobial effect of bupivacaine was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml (0.05% 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%). bupivacaine at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml inhibited the growth of the sensitive s. epidermidis strain, s. pyogenes, and s. pneumoniae, and all of the others except p. aeruginosa at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. morphine 0.2 and 2 mg/ml (0.02 and 0.2%) did not inhibit any of the strains.
selective survival in pentazocine and tripelennamine of pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype o11 from drug addicts.
the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, particularly serotype o11, in pentazocine and tripelennamine ("t's and blues") was evaluated as a possible explanation for the association of deep-seated infection with this organism and abuse of these drugs. the mean reduction of growth caused by the drugs was 1,000-fold greater for 49 pseudomonas strains from normal subjects than for 32 strains from drug addicts (4.2 vs. 1.3 logs of reduction at 2 hr, p less than .0005). a common phenotypic subset of the serotype o11 strains from drug addicts was especially resistant to the inhibitory effects. twelve strains of staphylococcus aureus (a frequent cause of infection in heroin, but not in pentazocine and tripelennamine, addicts) were completely inhibited by the drug combination. dose-response curves (derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders) showed that tripelennamine was responsible for the inhibitory activity, which was partially antagonized by pentazocine. we conclude that an ability of some p. aeruginosa serotype o11 strains, but not s. aureus, to survive in pentazocine and tripelennamine may explain in part a shift from s. aureus to p. aeruginosa as common pathogens of drug addicts in areas where abuse of this combination of drugs has increased.
comparison of a new cephalosporin, bmy 28142, with other broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics.
bmy 28142, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in comparison with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, moxalactam, and cefoperazone. the activity of bmy 28142 compared favorably with the activities of the other compounds against both pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and was somewhat greater against members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the influence of inoculum size on mics of bmy 28142 was small for most of the isolates tested, except enterobacter species. with enterobacter strains, a marked inoculum effect was found with all of the compounds, and the effect was more pronounced in broth than agar. still, mics of bmy 28142 in broth did not exceed 16 micrograms/ml. of 37 enterobacteriaceae strains resistant to one or more of the comparison beta-lactams, none were resistant, at a low inoculum size (10(4) cfu), to bmy 28142, compared with 3 for moxalactam, 18 for ceftazidime, 23 for cefotaxime, and 34 for cefoperazone; at an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu, the number of resistant strains was 12, 17, 25, 34, and 37, respectively. binding to human serum proteins approximated 19%. recovery of 73% of the drug in mouse urine indicated good bioavailability. the in vitro profile was sustained in vivo by the results obtained with experimental infections in mice. bmy 28142 was as effective as ceftazidime against systemic infection with p. aeruginosa and as effective as cefotaxime against systemic infection with s. aureus. overall, infections with 18 of 20 strains representing nine genera were responsive to bmy 28142 at doses equivalent to or lower than those of the most effective of the comparison compounds.
ceftazidime. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
ceftazidime is a new 'third generation' cephalosporin administered intravenously  or intramuscularly. similarly to other third generation cephalosporins it has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic bacteria, is particularly active against enterobacteriaceae (including beta-lactamase-positive strains) and is resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases. importantly, in vitro ceftazidime is presently the most active cephalosporin available against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it is less active against staphylococcus aureus than first and second generation cephalosporins. only larger comparative trials are likely to discern any statistically significant differences in clinical efficacy which may exist between ceftazidime and other antibiotics, but ceftazidime appears to be similar in efficacy to 'standard' comparative drugs in lower respiratory tract infections and complicated and/or chronic urinary tract infections among debilitated or hospitalised patients. thus, in patients having gram-negative infections at these sites and in whom the potential toxicity of the aminoglycosides is a concern, ceftazidime may be a valuable alternative in that it apparently lacks serious side effects and does not require routine drug plasma concentration monitoring. in fibrocystic patients having acute respiratory tract infections, ceftazidime is highly effective at both reducing symptoms of infection and temporarily reducing the sputum counts of pseudomonas species. however, in these patients resistance to ceftazidime may develop, as seen with other beta-lactam antibiotics. in the treatment of fever of unknown origin or documented infections in immunocompromised adults and children, ceftazidime appears to be similar in efficacy to various 2- or 3-drug combinations. nevertheless, the coadministration of an antibiotic having greater efficacy against gram-positive bacteria should be considered in immunocompromised patients. results from a small number of comparative trials suggest that ceftazidime may be as effective as the aminoglycosides in intra-abdominal, obstetric and gynaecological, and skin and soft tissue infections. however, further clinical experience, particularly a few well designed comparative studies, is needed to clarify the comparative efficacy in these conditions as well as in septicaemia/bacteraemia, meningitis, and bone and joint infections.
trends in bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
concern over the development of drug resistance by common pathogens has grown over recent years. in order to discover and describe possible trends at this institution, susceptibility data for 18 organisms and 21 antimicrobial agents for the years 1975 through 1982 at the veterans administration medical center in oklahoma city were reviewed. summaries of susceptibility data for 64 major combinations of drugs and organisms are presented. two gram-positive organisms (enterococcus group d and staphylococcus aureus) as well as a gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa) appear to be decreasing in susceptibility to several drugs. however, some gram-negative bacilli (proteus, serratia, and enterobacter spp. and klebsiella pneumoniae) showed evidence of markedly increasing susceptibility to certain drugs.
inflammatory responses to pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus in the murine lung.
the changes in pulmonary cell population in response to aerosols containing either pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus were studied in a murine model. the lungs of inbred dba/2j mice received an inoculum of 2 x 10(5) colony-forming units of the microorganism and lung lavages were performed at various time intervals thereafter. p. aeruginosa aerosols produced an immediate decrease in the number of resident alveolar macrophages (am), followed by a two-waved recruitment of cells into the respiratory tract; the first wave was composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) and the second of monocyte-like peroxidase-positive am. the change in cell populations was transient and returned to baseline values within a week after aerosolization. in contrast, aerosolized s. aureus initially induced a slight increase in mononuclear cells, and by 60 min after aerosol exposure, the cell population was not different from that of control animals.
antimicrobial activity of clavines.
the antimicrobial activity of two clavine-type ergot alkaloids (agroclavine, festuclavine), and 16 derivatives against four human pathogenic bacteria and candida albicans was determined. it is shown that all ergolines tested with one exception exhibit antibacterial properties against one to four bacteria species. the most active compounds are 6-allyl-6-norfestuclavine (minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) 30 micrograms/ml against staphylococcus aureus), 1-propyl-6-norfestuclavine (mic 60 micrograms/ml against escherichia coli), 6-cyano-6-norfestuclavine (mic 250 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa), and 1-methyl-agroclavine (mic 200 micrograms/ml against proteus vulgaris). 1-allyl-6-norfestuclavine and 1-propyl-6-norfestuclavine showed a broad action spectrum: the growth of all four bacteria species and of candida albicans was inhibited. the most effective antifungal compounds are 1-propyl-6-norfestuclavine and 6-cyano-6-norfestuclavine (mic 250 micrograms/ml). three alkaloids of different structure (codeine, emetine, quinine) are inactive up to 500 micrograms/ml against the bacteria species and c. albicans. the acute toxicity (mouse) is remarkably diminished by the modifications of the natural clavines.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of the fluoroquinolone win 49375 (amifloxacin).
win 49375 (amifloxacin) is a synthetic antibacterial agent of the quinolone class. it is similar in chemical structure to pefloxacin but differs by containing a methylamino, rather than an ethyl, substituent at the 1-n position. the activity of win 49375 in vitro was comparable to those of norfloxacin and pefloxacin against enterobacteriaceae and generally greater than those of tobramycin and cefotaxime. win 49375 was more active in vitro than carbenicillin and mezlocillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and showed moderate activity against staphylococcus aureus, with mics of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. the in vitro activity of win 49375 was not markedly affected by the presence of human serum, the size of the bacterial inoculum, or changes in ph between 6 and 8. against systemic, gram-negative bacterial infections in mice, win 49375 was generally less active than cefotaxime but more active than gentamicin. win 49548, the major piperazinyl-n-desmethyl metabolite of win 49375, was aa effective as the parent drug against experimental infections in mice when given parenterally. when administered orally, however, this metabolite was less potent than win 49375. win 49375 was highly active by the oral route, with 50% effective doses within two- to threefold of those obtained with parenteral medication.
comparative in vitro activity of ceftriaxone against clinical bacterial isolates  in nigeria.
the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin derivative, recently introduced in nigeria was compared with the activities of other related beta-lactam antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefuroxime, cephaloridine, cloxacillin/ampicillin and ampicillin against 530 local clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the spectra of activity and potency of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were generally similar against the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia spp., streptococcus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis when compared to cefotaxime. all the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested were less active than ceftriaxone. the action of ceftriaxone was bactericidal and the minimum inhibitory concentration values observed with r-plasmid beta-lactamase mediated resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and n. gonorrhoeae strains did not exceed the maximum value obtained with the beta-lactamase-negative strains.
in vitro antibacterial activity of imipenem against pseudomonas and staphylococcus species. comparison with thirteen other antimicrobial agents.
the in vitro antimicrobial activity of imipenem against recent clinical isolates  of pseudomonas spp. (94 strains) and penicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. (50 staph. aureus and 50 coagulase-negative staphylococcus) was assessed using the mueller-hinton agar dilution method. results were compared with those simultaneously obtained for amikacin, netilmicin, tobramycin, norfloxacin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and azthreonam against pseudomonas spp., and for rifampicin, clindamycin, netilmicin and cefoxitin, besides penicillin and methacillin, against staphylococcus spp. about 50 and 90% of 84 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by concentrations of imipenem equal to or less than 2 and 8 mg/l respectively. the in vitro activity of imipenem was comparable to that of ceftazidime and norfloxacin, but superior to that of the aminoglycosides and all the other antibiotics tested, in terms of potency by weight. among other pseudomonas spp. only p. malthophilia (2 strains) proved resistant to imipenem. rifampicin was the most active antibiotic by weight against staph. aureus but imipenem was more active than clindamycin and, especially, netilmicin and cefoxitin. imipenem was highly active also against coagulase-negative staphylococci, with some differences related to the high incidence of methicillin-resistant strains. mics of imipenem in mueller-hinton broth correlated with those obtained in agar, unlike the aminoglycosides. there were no significant inoculum effects on mics of imipenem and mbcs were within one twofold dilution of mics in over 75% of assays.
in vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. on the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (mic90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall mic90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin b against klebsiella pneumoniae (mic90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin b against pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against staphylococcus aureus, (mic90 = 2 mg/l in each case). along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (mic90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against moraxella species. compared to erythromycin (mic90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (mic90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. these results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., shigella sonnei, salmonella typhi, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. the activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against ps. aeruginosa. pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant ps. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant staph. aureus. strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
polyclonal b cell activators inhibit contact sensitivity to oxazolone in mice by  potentiating the production of anti-hapten antibodies that induce t suppressor lymphocytes acting through the release of soluble factors.
polyclonal b cell activators (pbas) such as purified protein derivative, lipopolysaccharide, staphylococcus aureus strain cowan i (stacwi), and pseudomonas aeruginosa inhibit contact sensitivity to oxazolone in mice when given 24 h before sensitization. this suppression, transferable from immunodepressed animals to oxazolone-sensitized recipients with immune serum, has been shown to be due to the early appearance of anti-hapten antibodies. these antibodies elicit t suppressor cells which release soluble factor(s) capable of inhibiting the passive transfer of contact sensitivity.
preclinical comparative evaluation of aminoglycosides.
five aminoglycoside antibiotics including gentamicin, sisomicin, tobramycin, amikacin and netilmicin were comparatively tested in vitro against 283 clinical isolates of pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive cocci, using the agar dilution technique according to i.c.s. recommendations. in respect to potency by weight, netilmicin proved the most active aminoglycoside against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, enterobacter, serratia spp. and staphylococcus aureus, followed by sisomicin or tobramycin in relation to various bacterial species. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, sisomicin and tobramycin had the lowest mics (minimum inhibitory concentrations). amikacin had overall less activity but the widest spectrum. rate of killing curves showed few differences among the aminoglycosides tested. against gentamicin-resistant strains (mic greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) the activity of netilmicin was comparable to or higher than that of amikacin, except for p. aeruginosa, p. cepacia and indole-positive proteus, which were inhibited by amikacin only. netilmicin also showed the highest "therapeutical index" calculated as the ratio between mic and blood levels for each aminoglycoside against each most important bacterial specie.
3-0-demethyl fortimicin a: in vitro activity and interpretive zone standards for  disk diffusion susceptibility tests.
the in vitro activity of 3-0-demethyl fortimicin a was compared to that of amikacin and tobramycin against 5,230 clinical isolates in four institutions. amikacin and tobramycin were more active than 3-0-demethyl fortimicin a against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., but all three drugs had similar activity against the enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus. additional tests with 335 representative gram-negative bacilli compared five different aminoglycosides, demonstrating differences with some isolates. standardized disk diffusion tests were also performed with 30 micrograms 3-0-demethyl fortimicin a disks, according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the following interpretive breakpoints are proposed: less than or equal to 11 mm for resistant (mic greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) and greater than or equal to 15 mm for susceptible (mic less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml).
[in vitro antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against uropathogenic organisms].
ciprofloxacin (bay 09867) is a new quinoline derivative. its activity against 537 urinary bacterial isolates was compared with those of ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, nalidixic and oxolinic acids, norfloxacin, trimethoprim, and other antimicrobial agents, when appropriate. it inhibited 90% citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., e, coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp., and serratia spp. at less than or equal to 0.78 microgram/ml. the majority of pseudomonas aeruginosa, including gentamicin-resistant strains, was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.12 micrograms/ml. mics of bay 09867 for 90% of staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus faecalis were 0.78 micrograms/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml respectively. bay 09867 inhibited organisms resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, nalidixic and oxolinic acids and trimethoprim.
the activity of enoxacin against clinical bacterial isolates in comparison with that of five other agents, and factors affecting that activity.
the activity of enoxacin against 362 clinical bacterial isolates in comparison with norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, latamoxef (moxalactam) and gentamicin was tested by an agar dilution method. typical mics for enterobacteria lay between 0.12 and 1.0 mg/l. enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. tended to be more resistant. enoxacin was also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mean mic 0.5 mg/l) and highly active against fastidious gram-negative aerobes. typical mics for staphylococcus aureus were 1-2 mg/l while streptococci were more resistant (16-32 mg/l). enoxacin had no useful activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens. enoxacin was generally more active at ph 8 than ph 6, and in broth than in urine. it was bactericidal in its action. daily serial passage from growth in broth containing enoxacin caused decreased sensitivity which was limited to four- to 16-fold greater than the original mic. enoxacin was about half as active as norfloxacin against enterobacteria, equally active against staphylococci, and some two to four times less active against streptococci.
wide-spectrum antibiotic activity of bovine granulocyte polypeptides.
the antibiotic activity of a polypeptide fraction purified from bovine granulocyte granules was tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, bacillus stearothermophilus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and clinical isolates of staphylococcus and enterobacter spp. all of these bacterial species were susceptible to the antibiotic polypeptide(s), with mics ranging from 3 to 100 micrograms of protein per ml. the antimicrobial activity was resistant to boiling and abolished by proteinase treatment. saccharomyces cerevisiae and human fibroblasts grew normally in the presence of 100 and 50 micrograms of antibiotic polypeptide(s) per ml, respectively. [3h]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, dna was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. this suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial dna.
antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin in conventional tests and in a model of bacterial cystitis.
in conventional in vitro tests and an experimental bladder model ciprofloxacin proved very active against 103 strains of enterobacteria isolated from infected urine. nalidixic acid-resistant strains were less susceptible to ciprofloxacin than nalidixic acid-sensitive strains, and the activity of the drug was reduced under acid conditions. nevertheless, all strains were inhibited by 4 mg/l of ciprofloxacin at ph 5.5. streptococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides spp. were less susceptible than enterobacteria, although most strains were inhibited by a therapeutically achievable concentration of 2 mg/l. under conditions simulating the treatment of bacterial cystitis, changing concentrations of ciprofloxacin well within levels achievable in urine inhibited dense bacterial cultures for periods exceeding 24 hours, and surviving bacteria did not exhibit any reduction in susceptibility.
third-generation cephalosporins: a critical evaluation.
six third-generation cephalosporins--cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoperazone, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, and cefmenoxime--are reviewed; covered are chemistry and structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, spectra of activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical utility, adverse effects, and cost effectiveness. the third-generation cephalosporins have a similar mechanism of action to that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. none of the agents is particularly active against certain gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; the drugs are effective against gonococci, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. several common gram-negative pathogens are susceptible to the third-generation cephalosporins, including escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter diversus, proteus, and morganella. about 50% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates are susceptible. only moxalactam has good activity against bacteriodes fragilis. the pharmacokinetic profiles of the six agents reveal some important differences. the half-life of ceftriaxone allows once-daily dosing in many patients; the half-lives of ceftizoxime and cefoperazone permit dosing every 8-12 hours. cefoperazone and ceftriaxone are highly protein bound, but the clinical relevance of this is unknown. generally, the agents penetrate most body tissues and fluids well. moxalactam and cefotaxime and possibly ceftriaxone effectively penetrate into the cerebrospinal fluid well. the third-generation cephalosporins have become the accepted drugs of choice for the treatment of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis; as more experience is gained, they are likely to become the drugs of first choice for neonatal (with ampicillin) and childhood (except for moxalactam) meningitis. serious infections of enterobacteriaceae can be treated with these agents, thereby avoiding use of the aminoglycosides. moxalactam is comparable with combination therapy in treating intra-abdominal infections. adverse effects associated with use of the third-generation cephalosporins are generally similar to those that occur with other beta-lactam antibiotics with the exception of coagulopathies and the disulfiram reaction seen with moxalactam and cefoperazone. despite the relatively high cost of the third-generation cephalosporins, they are often cost effective because of their reduced dosing frequencies, broad spectra of activity, and effectiveness in serious infections for which more toxic antibiotics have been required in the past.
in vivo antibacterial activity of cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
the in vivo activity of cefodizime (hr 221) was compared with that of cefotaxime  (ctx), cefmenoxime, latamoxef, cefazolin and cefmetazole (cmz). the protective effects of hr 221 on experimental infections in mice caused by staphylococcus aureus smith, escherichia coli c-11, proteus vulgaris gn-76 and serratia marcescens no. 2 were directly related to its in vitro activity against these strains. in contrast, the compound showed the smallest ed50 values, among the 5 antibiotics tested (not including cmz), for klebsiella pneumoniae 3k-25 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pi 67 against which it had relatively low in vitro activity, and its ed50 for citrobacter freundii gn-346 was as small as 1.821 mg/mouse in spite of its mic of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. hr 221 exerted potent bactericidal activity against streptococcus pneumoniae sp-1 inoculated into the mouse lung; the duration of action was prolonged. when tested against the e. coli ec-89 infection induced in the rat uterus, the activity of hr 221 given to rats once daily was equal to that of ctx or cmz given at the same dose twice daily.
chemotherapeutic properties of the new cephalosporin antibiotic hr810 in laboratory animals.
the chemotherapeutic properties of the new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin hr810 were investigated in experimental animals. unlike other cephalosporins of the third generation, hr810 had good activity against staphylococcus aureus as well as some activity against enterococci. in murine protection tests with these strains, it was clearly superior to ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone and latamoxef. the compounds most effective in protecting mice from infections caused by enterobacteriaceae were hr810 and ceftriaxone followed by ceftazidime, latamoxef and cefotaxime; cefoperazone was less active. hr810 was less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa than ceftazidime but was considerably more effective than the other cephalosporins tested. hr810 also proved effective against localised infections such as thigh lesions, as well as against meningo-encephalitis in mice and pyelonephritis in rats. these results in laboratory animals make hr810 a promising candidate for clinical studies.
in vitro evaluation of hr810, a new wide-spectrum aminothiazolyl alpha-methoxyimino cephalosporin.
hr810 (hoechst-roussel pharmaceuticals inc., somerville, n.j.) is a new, cyclical-pyridinium cephalosporin that appeared superior to numerous comparison drugs against 658 strains of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. seventeen enterobacteriaceae spp. were tested by broth microdilution methods, and the 50% mics (mic50s) and 90% mics (mic90s) were 0.03 to 0.12 and 0.03 to 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. only one strain had an mic greater than 8.0 micrograms/ml (99.6% is considered susceptible). hr810 inhibited 98% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 for acinetobacter spp. was 4.0 micrograms/ml. it was also very active against pseudomonas spp. and staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) but marginally active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcal strains (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) and enterococcus (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml). non-enterococcal streptococci had mic50s ranging from 0.008 micrograms/ml for streptococcus pyogenes to 0.12 micrograms/ml for pneumococci. all mics of hr810 against haemophilus and neisseria spp. were less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml (mic50, 0.002 to 0.008 micrograms/ml). hr810 poorly inhibited beta-lactamases and was very stable against 11 tested beta-lactamases of plasmid (tem, oxa, shv-1, and pse) and chromosomal (k1, k14, p99) types.
[sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the pitie-salpetriere hospital in 1982 and 1983].
susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (fos) was tested with mueller-hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms fos + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). for 3 411 strains, inhibition zone diameters were recorded. almost all e. coli, citrobacter, salmonella and s. aureus were susceptible to fos as well as 70% of serratia, e. cloacae, p. mirabilis and 50% of klebsiella and enterobacter sp. only 27% of p. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive proteus and 8% of acinetobacter were sensitive to fos. e. coli, citrobacter and s. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to fos. sensitivity rates of e. cloacae, serratia, p. aeruginosa, and especially klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. this method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate g6p concentrations at this point of the disk.
antibacterial activity of coumermycin alone and in combination with other antibiotics.
coumermycin has been shown to inhibit staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains that are susceptible and those that are resistant to methicillin at concentrations less than or equal to 0.05 micrograms/ml. listeria monocytogenes and corynebacterium spp. resistant to cephalosporins were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.6 micrograms of coumermycin ml, and streptococcal species, with the exception of streptococcus faecalis, were inhibited by 0.1 micrograms/ml. cross-resistance with beta-lactams or aminoglycosides was not found. coumermycin acted synergistically with ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and enoxacin against s. aureus but did not show synergy when combined with nafcillin, vancomycin, or rifampin. coumermycin did not inhibit members of the family enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa.
study of the in vitro activity of norfloxacin and other drugs on amoxicillin-resistant uropathogenic isolates.
the in vitro activity of a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound, norfloxacin, was compared with those of amikacin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, and oxolinic acid against 243 gram-positive and gram-negative amoxicillin-resistant (mic 800 greater than or equal to micrograms/ml) uropathogenic isolates. norfloxacin showed remarkable activity against the majority of the bacteria tested. ninety percent of strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii and serratia spp. were inhibited by 3.12 micrograms/ml or less. among the gram-negative urinary isolates, only a few enterobacter, escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains required norfloxacin levels between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml. the mbc was within one dilution of the mic for 100% of the gram-positive strains and 95% of the gram-negative isolates against norfloxacin and aminoglycosides. norfloxacin had a markedly higher inhibitory index than all other antimicrobial agents for gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacteria. from its in vitro activity, norfloxacin appears to be a potentially valuable agent for the treatment of serious urinary tract infections.
[significance of antibiotic-forming microorganisms in biological waste water clarification].
streptomyces spec. producing antibiotics were detected very seldom in the wastewater pretreatment plant of braunschweig. however, bacillus spec. producing antibiotics are common. there are about one permille of the total population of bacteria in wastewater (fig. 1). reflecting the total number of bacteria, the psychrophilic microorganisms growing at 20 degrees c increase more during the oxidation step of wastewater treatment than the mesophilic bacteria growing at 30 or 37 degrees c. but reflecting the bacilli the strains producing antibiotics growing at 30 or 37 degrees c propagate stronger than the psychrophilic group (fig. 2). about 90% or more of a total of 194 isolated bacillus strains producing antibiotics showed antibiotic activity against the tested grampositive bacteria listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. only few strains were active against candida albicans, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium (fig. 3, 4, and table 1). during the summer (july) the percentage of strains producing antibiotics against grampositive bacteria was higher than in the winter (january) (fig. 4). also the deep freezing of samples increased the percentage of antibiotic producers (fig. 2). some species were isolated even only from freezed and again thawed samples (table 1).
ceftizoxime: a beta-lactamase-stable, broad-spectrum cephalosporin. pharmacokinetics, adverse effects and clinical use.
ceftizoxime is an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin that inhibits a wide  variety of aerobic, anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml as are streptococcal species with the exception of streptococcus faecalis. staphylococcus aureus are inhibited by 3-8 micrograms/ml, while methicillin-resistant. aureus are resistant. bacteroides fragilis are inhibited by 16-64 micrograms/ml. it inhibits pseudomonas aeruginosa at usually achievable concentrations. ceftizoxime is overall similar in antibacterial activity to cefotaxime and moxalactam. ceftizoxime is not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. serum levels of ceftizoxime after intramuscular and intravenous injection are similar to those of cefotaxime and moxalactam. the half-life is 1.6 to 1.9 hours in normal individuals. the compound is not metabolized and is cleared from the body by glomerular filtration. ceftizoxime enters most body fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid, to produce therapeutic concentrations against clinically important bacteria. ceftizoxime accumulates in the presence of renal failure, but it is removed from the body by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. ceftizoxime has proved to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent when used as treatment for pneumonia, urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, meningitis, peritonitis, gonorrhea, including penicillinase-producing isolates, and gynecological infections. no major adverse reactions have been associated with the use of ceftizoxime and it has produced neither disulfram -like reactions nor bleeding.
ciprofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compound active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
the in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, a quinolone-carboxylic acid derivative, was compared with those of norfloxacin, cefotaxime, cephalexin, ceftazidime, moxalactam, amoxicillin, and methicillin and other agents, as appropriate. the mics of ciprofloxacin for 90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and for pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria spp., and bacteroides fragilis were between 0.005 and 0.8 micrograms/ml, whereas streptococci and staphylococci were all inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin was 4- to 32-fold more active than norfloxacin and inhibited gentamicin-, ameikacin-, cefotaxime-, and moxalactam-resistant members of the family enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the activity of ciprofloxacin was not affected by serum but decreased in the presence of acid urine. the frequency of resistance to ciprofloxacin was between 10(-7) and 10(-9).
in vitro antimicrobial activity of aztreonam alone and in combination against bacterial isolates from pediatric patients.
we examined 134 pediatric clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive cocci for susceptibility to aztreonam alone and in combination with seven other antibiotics. all 98 gram-negative isolates were susceptible to aztreonam with similar inhibitory and bactericidal activity. combinations of aztreonam with cefoxitin, ampicillin, or clindamycin were generally indifferent or additive. synergism was occasionally seen against enteric organisms with aztreonam plus cefoxitin or clindamycin. combinations of tobramycin and aztreonam were synergistic (62%) against p. aeruginosa; aztreonam plus piperacillin or ticarcillin was additive. aztreonam did not affect the activity of nafcillin against staphylococcus aureus, or of ampicillin against species of streptococcus group b or d. antagonism was seen only with aztreonam plus cefoxitin against enterobacter species, but not at clinically significant concentrations. several combinations of antibiotics with aztreonam should be appropriate for initial therapy of infections in children without major risks of antibacterial antagonism.
ceftazidime: in vitro comparison with cephalothin, cefuroxime, and netilmicin. a  norwegian study.
the in vitro activity of ceftazidime has been compared with those of cephalothin, cefuroxime, and netilmicin against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in order to register sensitivity patterns in the western part of norway. an agar dilution method was used for minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) determination. ceftazidime was the most active agent against enterobacteriaceae; all isolates being inhibited by 2 mg/l or less, whereas netilmicin was slightly less active, especially against providencia. cephalothin and cefuroxime were markedly less active than the other two agents against enterobacteriaceae. ceftazidime and netilmicin were active against our pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (mics less than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 8 mg/l, respectively). only netilmicin had useful activity against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. ceftazidime was the least active agent against staphylococcus aureus; nearly all the isolates had mics of 4-8 mg/l. cefuroxime was the most active agent against bacteroides fragilis, whereas ceftazidime was inactive. ceftazidime may, in the future, be a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections, particularly when p. aeruginosa might be involved.
ceftizoxime (fk 749) in vitro antibacterial activity.
the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoperazone, cefotiam and cefamandole were determined against various species of gram-negative bacteria and against staphylococcus aureus. ceftizoxime was more active against enterobacteriaceae than cefamandole, cefotiam and cefoperazone and slightly more active than or similar to moxalactam and cefotaxime. like cefotaxime and moxalactam, ceftizoxime was less active than cefoperazone against pseudomonas aeruginosa and less active than cefamandole against s. aureus. ceftizoxime was active against cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae with a mean mic of 0.19 mg/l. however, some isolates had an mic above 32 mg/l.
ceftriaxone: a summary of in vitro antibacterial qualities including recommendations for susceptibility tests with 30-micrograms disks.
the new aminothiazoyl-cephalosporin, ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), was found to have  excellent inhibitory activity against the enterobacteriaceae (minimum inhibitory concentration needed to inhibit 50% of isolates (mic50) less than or equal to 0.004-0.5 microgram/ml, haemophilus influenzae (mic50 less than or equal to 0.004 micrograms/ml), neisseria species (mic50 less than or equal to 0.001 microgram/ml), pneumococci (mic50 0.25 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic50 2.0 micrograms/ml), and streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 0.015 micrograms/ml). ceftriaxone was less effective against acinetobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other pseudomonas species (mic50 8.0-16 micrograms/ml). methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci were not significantly inhibited by ceftriaxone. ceftriaxone was very resistant to beta-lactamase hydrolysis, although the type iv cephalosporinase minimally destroyed the compound at 16.4-19.9% of the rates for cephaloridine. type i cephalosporinases were inhibited by ceftriaxone and related enzyme-stable cephalosporins. based on analysis of disk-mic regression statistics, tentative recommendations for the disk test of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards are 21 mm or more = susceptible, 14-20 mm = moderately susceptible, and 13 mm or less = resistant. these criteria produce interpretive accuracy of more than 92%, with very rare major errors. ceftriaxone was comparable to cefotaxime in spectrum and activity, thus allowing the use of the "spectrum-class" concept (for example, cefotaxime tests in vitro to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility, and vice versa).
antibacterial activity studies of flavonoids from salvia palaestina.
ten aglycones and six glycosides of luteolin and apigenin were identified from the leaves of salvia palaestina bentham (labiatae). among them cirsimaritin showed a high activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the others have little or no activity against the same bacterial strains.
[susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1981)].
during the period from september 1981 to march 1982, 363 bacterial isolates were  obtained as possible pathogens from 311 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in japan. of these clinical isolates, mostly from the sputum, a total of 231 isolates including 19 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 33 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 90 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 65 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 7 strains of escherichia coli were tested in vitro for minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 17 antimicrobial agents, and their antimicrobial susceptibility distribution and cumulative percentages of inhibited isolates by increasing concentrations of drugs were determined. the data were further analyzed to investigate the interrelation between such parameters as the age-distribution of patients by diseases of the respiratory system, sex and types of infection and the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms, and also the relationship between the antimicrobial chemotherapy prior to collection of clinical specimens and the species and incidence of the bacterial isolates. in respiratory infections, it is frequently that chemotherapy should be instituted with an appropriate drug even before the causative organism can be identified and assessed for its antimicrobial susceptibility. the present data may provide valuable informations in selecting appropriate drugs in practical, clinical use.
in vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas sp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. the majority of pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml. haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. although most staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid ph than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. there was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.
effect of azlocillin and piperacillin in subinhibitory and inhibitory concentrations on staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in broth, in serum and in the presence of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
the bactericidal activity of azlocillin and piperacillin was tested at concentrations of 1/4 the mic, the mic and four-fold the mic agents a serum-resistant staphylococcus aureus and a serum-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa strain in broth, in serum and in the presence of leukocytes. the antibacterial activity of azlocillin and piperacillin in serum against staphylococcus aureus was slightly better than in broth (p greater than 0.05); both compounds were distinctly less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa in serum than in broth (p less than 0.05). both antibiotics enhanced susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to leukocyte killing without serum (p less than 0.05), whereas leukocyte killing of staphylococcus aureus was hardly improved even at the mic and four-fold the mic of both compounds. the antibacterial activity of azlocillin and piperacillin against both bacterial strains was most pronounced in the presence of leukocytes and serum. a marked bactericidal effect was achieved at 1/4 the mic, the effect not being further significantly enhanced (p greater than 0.05) at the mic or four-fold the mic.
pharmacokinetic and microbial susceptibility studies of ceftriaxone.
the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was tested  against 450 strains isolated from blood cultures and compared with that of various other antibiotics. the compound was comparable to cefotaxime for all species tested. it was more potent than cefoperazone, cefamandole and ticarcillin in inhibiting enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp. and serratia marcescens). the mic95 of ceftriaxone for these strains was 0.5 microgram/ml. the drug was less active against staphylococcus aureus than cefamandole, cloxacillin and vancomycin, but most isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftriaxone was comparable in activity to ticarcillin (mic95 = 64 micrograms/ml), and inferior to cefoperazone, ceftazidime and cefsulodine. levels of ceftriaxone in serum and various body fluids were determined by bio-assays. due to its very long half-life (8 h), ceftriaxone serum levels 24 h after i.v. or i.m. injection of 1 and 2 g were still above the mic95 of all strains tested except pseudomonas aeruginosa. levels in bile, synovial and cerebro-spinal fluids were high.
the turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 klett-summerson colorimeter units. the suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees c. turbidities for proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.
in vitro activity of hr 810, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
hr 810, 3-[(2,3-cyclopenteno-1-pyridinium)methyl]-7-[2-syn-methoximino-2-(2-aminothiazole -4-yl)-acetamido] ceph-3-em-4-carboxylate, is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative. the in vitro activity of hr 810 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin and gentamicin using 368 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. hr 810 was highly active against enterobacteriaceae, being the most active of the cephalosporins against enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter spp.; the mics ranged from much less than 0.06 to 8 mg/l. the activity of hr 810 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. was almost as good as that of ceftazidime. the new compound was superior to the other cephalosporins against staphylococcus aureus and inhibited all streptococcus faecalis strains at a concentration of 16 mg/l.
in vitro inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation by pseudomonas aeruginosa phenazine pigments.
human lymphocyte proliferation is inhibited in vitro in the presence of killed pseudomonas aeruginosa or cell-free p. aeruginosa culture supernatants. a comparison of culture supernatants obtained under similar conditions from staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and pseudomonas cepacia strains demonstrated that all p. aeruginosa supernatants were strongly inhibitory, whereas supernatants from other bacteria were mildly inhibitory or not inhibitory at all. these p. aeruginosa inhibitors prevent proliferative responses of resting cells upon mitogen activation and decrease [3h]thymidine uptake when added to human lymphocytes undergoing active proliferation in culture. the inhibitory effect is reversible and not due to cytotoxicity. most of the inhibitory activity present in crude supernatants was detected in ultrafiltrates of molecular weights below 2,000. purified p. aeruginosa pyocyanine, a low-molecular-weight phenazine pigment present in culture supernatant, was strongly inhibitory for lymphocyte proliferation. extraction of pyocyanine and phenazine pigments from inhibitory p. aeruginosa supernatants eliminated their inhibitory activity. inhibitors were recovered from reverse-phase chromatographic cartridges by both chloroform and methanol elution, indicating that pyocyanine and other phenazine pigments present in p. aeruginosa supernatants are responsible for the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation. in addition to the identification of phenazine pigments as lymphocyte proliferation inhibitors, several criteria ruled out major contributions of p. aeruginosa polysaccharide, exotoxin a, and proteases to this phenomenon. p. aeruginosa strains selected for very low protease production or for very low exotoxin a production produced supernatants as inhibitory for lymphocyte proliferation as supernatants obtained from clinical p. aeruginosa isolates. purified p. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide and protease preparations failed to induce reversible lymphocyte proliferation inhibition. finally, heat inactivation of p. aeruginosa supernatants at 100 degrees c for 60 min inactivates exotoxin a and proteases but produced only a moderate decrease of the inhibitory activity for lymphocyte proliferation.
comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin against urinary tract pathogens.
the in vitro activity of norfloxacin (mk366) against 477 aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates was compared to that of nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, cephalexin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and the combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. norfloxacin was more active than the other agents against all gram-negative organisms tested. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of pseudomonas aeruginosa were less than or equal to 0.125-32 mg/l with 90% inhibited (mic90) by 4 mg/l; mics of the enterobacteriaceae including serratia marcescens were less than or equal to 0.125-8 mg/l with an mic90 of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. there was also excellent activity against the gram-positive cocci including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and the enterococci, with mics less than or equal to 0.125-4 mg/l and an mic90 less than or equal to 4 mg/l. only 8 of 477 organisms were norfloxacin-resistant (mic greater than or equal to 16 mg/l): 3 of 100 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 of 10 pseudomonas maltophilia and 2 of 15 streptococcus bovis strains. in contrast, 97% of the gram-positive cocci and 49% of the gram-negative bacilli were nalidixic acid-resistant (mic greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). norfloxacin shows excellent activity against a wide range of bacteria and merits further study as a urinary antibacterial agent.
quality control of moxalactam susceptibility disks.
in vitro evaluation of two types of moxalactam disks revealed significant performance differences when staphylococcus aureus was being tested. the differences were traced to the amount of decarboxylated moxalactam present in the disks. the decarboxylated analog was much more active than the parent compound against s. aureus, not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and approximately as active as the parent compound against escherichia coli. a nine-laboratory coordinated study was performed to establish quality control parameters for 30-micrograms moxalactam disks. problems with the establishment of interpretive standards for moxalactam disk tests were evaluated in the light of differences between disks utilized in earlier studies and those that are now commercially available. the type of disk greatly influences standards for tests with s. aureus but has insignificant influence on testing gram-negative bacilli.
susceptibility of blood isolates to various antibiotics, in particular to cephalosporins.
of 760 bacterial pathogens isolated from blood cultures of acutely ill patients in a general hospital in hong kong for 1 year, 69.9% of the isolates were gram-negative aerobes mainly escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 22.0% were gram-positive aerobes mainly staphylococcus aureus and enterococci and 8.1% were anaerobes mainly bacteroides spp. the susceptibility of the aerobic isolates to various antibiotics was tested. ampicillin was found to be active mainly against the enterococci and some other gram-positive organisms while most isolates of staph. aureus and the gram-negative bacteria were resistant. in contrast, cephalothin was found only slightly less active than the second generation cephalosporins against gram-negative blood isolates but considerably more active against staph. aureus and other gram-positive isolates. the three aminoglycosides tested, i.e., gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, showed similar good activity against e. coli, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, but amikacin had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting most of the other gram-negative isolates as well as isolates of staph. aureus. the third generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, latamoxef (moxalactam), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, all had a high activity against the gram-negative but a reduced activity against the gram-positive bacteria. ceftazidime had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting all the gram-negative isolates including pseudomonas aeruginosa, while cefotaxime showed the best overall activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative blood isolates.
antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. in this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (mic) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group a and b streptococci streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. klebsiella, enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
microbiological and clinical evaluation of the isolator lysis-centrifugation blood culture tube.
in a controlled evaluation of 6,010 blood cultures, the yield of clinically significant microorganisms was greater from a lysis-centrifugation system (isolator, du pont co.) than from a nonvented vacuum bottle containing tryptic soy broth with sodium polyanetholesulfonate and co2 and a vented bottle containing biphasic brain heart infusion medium with sodium polyanetholesulfonate. the isolator significantly increased the frequency of isolation of staphylococcus aureus and candida spp. and significantly decreased the time required for the detection of s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida spp.; however, anaerobic bacteria were recovered significantly more frequently from nonvented bottles with tryptic soy broth, and pneumococci were recovered significantly more frequently from both bottle systems. contamination of cultures was significantly greater with the isolator system than with either bottle system. regardless of the number of blood cultures obtained per septic episode, the isolator detected microbiologically proven bacteremia or fungemia in a significantly greater number of patients and significantly decreased the time required for detection.
new broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. iii. synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
the influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (iii) was investigated. introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (iiif--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against proteus mirabilis. displacement of the acetoxy group of iiib with pyridines (iiim--p) enhanced the activity against p. aeruginosa and e. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin iiid having a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. as a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code no. sm-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
new broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. ii. synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[2-acylamino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-3-[ (1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
the influence of the chirality of the 7-acyl side chain and of various n-acyl moieties (a-co-) on the in vitro activity of 7 beta-[2-acylamino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido ]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (6) was investigated. a cephalosporin having a 7-acyl side chain of s-configuration (6r) was only weakly active against staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae and was inactive against the other species tested. among the various n-acyl moieties in the cephalosporins having a 7-acyl side chain of the r-configuration, the 4-hydroxypyridine-3-carbonyl moiety, unsubstituted or substituted with 5-bromo and/or 6-alkyl groups and the 4-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridine-3-carbonyl moiety, unsubstituted or substituted with a 6-methyl and a 6-methoxy group gave the most active compounds. n-ethylation of the 4-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridine-3-carbonyl derivative and the 4-hydroxypyridine-3-carbonyl derivative (6p, 6q) resulted in a decrease of the in vitro activity.
a comparative study of the efficacy and safety of azlocillin and gentamicin in the treatment of serious infections.
azlocillin, a new semisynthetic ureidopenicillin, has increased in-vitro activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and good activity against other gram-negative organisms. in a comparative clinical study, azlocillin was administered intravenously at 18 g/day to 24 patients and gentamicin intramuscularly at 3 to 5 mg/kg/day to 25 patients, most of whom had infections of the skin and skin structure, intra-abdominal cavity, or lower respiratory tract. gram-negative organisms, usually ps. aeruginosa or escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus, were isolated most frequently. at the end of therapy, 18/24 (75%) of the patients with one infection site had an excellent clinical response after azlocillin, as compared with 7/20 (35%) after gentamicin (p = 0.014). the overall response to treatment was cure in 17/24 (70.8%) of the azlocillin patients and 9/24 (37.5%) of the gentamicin patients (p = 0.042). bacteriological response was in the azlocillin group 28/33 or 84.8% as compared to the gentamicin group 38/51 or 74.5%.
n-formimidoyl thienamycin: in vitro comparison with cefoxitin and tobramycin against clinical, bacterial isolates.
the in vitro activity of the novel beta-lactam antibiotic, n-formimidoyl thienamycin (n-f thienamycin) has been compared with those of cefoxitin and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was employed. n-f thienamycin was active against all enterobacteriaceae isolates (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l). all pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 2 mg/l. n-f thienamycin was also active against acinetobacter calcoaceticus (96 per cent inhibited by 0.5 mg/l) and gram-positive cocci. all enterococci were inhibited by 2 mg/l. the drug was active against haemophilus influenzae (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and the bacteroides fragilis group (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l). cefoxitin was inactive against most enterobacter and a. calcoaceticus isolates and all p. aeruginosa and enterococcal isolates. tobramycin was virtually inactive against gram-positive cocci other than staphylococcus aureus. n-f thienamycin thus has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity, greater than that of cefoxitin and tobramycin, and may therefore be useful in the treatment of serious infection, particularly when the aetiology is unknown.
in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid.
the in vitro antibacterial activity of the new quinoline derivative ciprofloxacin (bay 0 9867) was evaluated in comparison to norfloxacin and nalidixic acid using 495 clinical strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the compound was highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with mics ranging from 0.008 mg/l to 4 mg/l, whereas the mics of norfloxacin ranged from 0.03 mg/l to 16 mg/l. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus were inhibited with a concentration of 2 mg/l ciprofloxacin and 32 mg/l norfloxacin. ciprofloxacin was also active against gram-positive cocci. the mics for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis ranged from 0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. the activity of ciprofloxacin was only slightly influenced by inoculum size, whereas an acid environment caused a noticeable decrease in the activity. ciprofloxacin would seem to be a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of urinary tract infection.
comparison of live bacteria infusions in a porcine model of acute respiratory failure.
acute respiratory failure (arf) related to sepsis continues to have a high mortality and uncertain pathogenesis. with a reproducible live pseudomonas aeruginosa infusion pig model, the gas exchange, hemodynamics, and pulmonary clearance of this organism were compared with live staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. lightly anesthetized, male, mixed-breed pigs, 15-30 kg, were intubated, allowed to breathe spontaneously, and had femoral artery, central venous, and swan-ganz catheterization through cutdowns. after baseline data were collected, approximately 1 x 10(9) organisms/20 kg/min were infused into a central vein for 4 hr with frequent monitoring of the variables. immediate autopsies were done for related quantitative tissue culture studies. s. aureus pigs maintained a high rate of lung bacterial clearance with pulmonary hypertension, a nonsignificant decrease in pao2, and relatively normal lungs at autopsy. ps. aeruginosa and e. coli animals developed systemic hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, hypoxemia, and decreased pulmonary clearance. their lungs had gross congestion and edema. these studies confirm the suitability of e. coli and ps. aeruginosa infusion into pigs as a model of sepsis-induced arf in man. the findings also indicate that neither pulmonary hypertension nor bacterial clearance by the lungs is sufficient to cause arf.
suppression of in vitro lymphocyte dna synthesis by killed pseudomonas aeruginosa.
whole antibiotic-killed classic pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms elicited human lymphocyte [3h]thymidine (tdr) uptake in vitro after 5 days in culture. however, high concentrations of the same preparation did not elicit [3h]tdr incorporation. the investigation of this lymphocyte unresponsiveness revealed that a high dose of p. aeruginosa, when added to lymphocyte cultures together with optimal concentrations of lymphocyte activators (e.g., plant lectins or whole killed staphylococcus aureus cowan 1), caused a potent, nonspecifically expressed inhibition of lymphocyte [3h]tdr uptake in response to these mitogens. high doses of p. aeruginosa were not cytotoxic to lymphocytes, and the inhibition caused was reversed when lymphocytes were washed free of bacteria. the inhibition of [3h]tdr uptake by high-dose p. aeruginosa did not require the generation of adherent suppressor cells or prostaglandin-mediated, steroid-sensitive or radiation-sensitive suppressor mechanisms. at optimal lymphocyte stimulatory concentrations of p. aeruginosa, the addition of indomethacin or the depletion of adherent cells caused an increase in lymphocyte [3h]tdr incorporation. this is consistent with an adherent-cell population regulating [3h]tdr uptake in response to p. aeruginosa via a prostaglandin-dependent pathway. this population was not involved in the inhibition of lymphocyte [3h]tdr uptake by high concentrations of p. aeruginosa.
in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan.
the in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a recently developed cephamycin, was investigated under various experimental conditions. the compound showed moderate activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis, but a high activity against enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. haemophilus influenzae also was fairly susceptible. the mbc was usually equal to or two- or fourfold higher than mic. medium composition, ph and inoculum size had minimal influence on its activity. about 50% of recent clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to cefotetan, but some were highly resistant. killing curves of cefotetan against different bacterial strains indicated that it was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations equal to mic or two- to fourfold higher. however, some strains showed regrowth after initial inhibition. combination of cefotetan with aminoglycosides, or with cefazolin, cefotaxime, moxalactam or piperacillin resulted either in synergy, addition or indifference according to the bacterial strain and the nature of the combination. antagonism was never observed. human serum protein binding varied from 75 to 86% according to the assay method. binding with horse serum protein was about 28%.
antibacterial activity of the cephamycin cefotetan: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
the cephamycin, cefotetan, was compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics including the monocyclic beta-lactam, azthreonam, against a total of 277 recent clinical isolates. cefotetan had activity comparable to moxalactam against staphylococcus aureus and against the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting all isolates except for serratia marcescens and enterobacter spp. at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. cefotetan was active against beta-lactamase producing and non-beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae (mic90 1 mg/l); was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l); and was eightfold less active than cefoxitin against the bacteroides fragilis group. azthreonam was as active as moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae and was more active than moxalactam against ps. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of isolates at less than or equal to 8 mg/l, but was inactive against the bact. fragilis group (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l) and against staphylococcus aureus (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l).
in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
the in vitro susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates, including 55 anaerobic bacteria, was tested with ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. ceftazidime was the most active drug against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. against enterobacteriaceae, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were similar to cefotaxime, moxalactam, and cefoperazone and more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. cefoxitin and moxalactam were significantly more active against bacteroides fragilis than were the other beta-lactam drugs. against staphylococcus aureus, ceftriaxone showed moderate activity, while ceftazidime was relatively inactive. these results indicate a potential role for ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against infections involving facultative and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
beta-lactamase inhibitory activity of iodopenicillanate and bromopenicillanate.
iodopenicillanate and bromopenicillanate were shown to be effective inhibitors of a variety of beta-lactamases. staphylococcus aureus isolates were synergistically inhibited by iodopenicillanate and bromopenicillanate combined with ampicillin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus was not synergistically inhibited. escherichia coli which possessed tem beta-lactamase activity had a reduction in ampicillin minimal inhibitory concentration, but an e. coli isolate which had chromosomal beta-lactamase and a low ampicillin minimal inhibitory concentration showed no reduction in ampicillin minimal inhibitory concentration with either iodopenicillanate or bromopenicillanate. of the klebsiella isolates tested, 80% were synergistically inhibited by both iodopenicillanate and bromopenicillanate. most morganella isolates were synergistically inhibited by either iodopenicillanate or bromopenicillanate combined with ampicillin, as were many salmonella, shigella, citrobacter diversus, and citrobacter freundii isolates. no pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were synergistically inhibited by iodopenicillanate or bromopenicillanate. preincubation did not improve the inhibitory activity of iodopenicillanate or bromopenicillanate.
cefotetan, a new cephamycin: comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activity with other cephems, beta-lactamase stability, and preliminary recommendations for disk diffusion testing.
cefotetan is a new, potent, 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin (cephamycin). the in vitro activity of cefotetan tested in a multiphasic, collaborative study against 12,260 consecutive clinical isolates and 448 selected isolates showed 93% of enterobacteriaceae, 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (broth dilution), 83% of bacteroides fragilis, and 72% of non-enterococcal streptococci to be inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing haemophilus influenzae strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. cefotetan's inhibitory spectrum paralleled those of the newest generation of cephems and exceeded those of cefoxitin and cefamandole. no useful activity was present against streptococcus faecalis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotetan was bactericidal without significant inoculum effect and was highly resistant to hydrolysis by richmond-sykes types i, iii, and iv beta-lactamases. hydrolysis of the chromogenic cephalosporin padac (pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin) by type i beta-lactamases was markedly inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan similar to those of the potent inhibitor dicloxacillin. analysis of agar disk diffusion for several disk potencies and broth dilution susceptibility tests by regression and error rate-bounding methods produced preliminary tentative zone standards (30-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than 32 micrograms/ml resistant, or 75-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml resistant) of greater than or equal to 18 mm susceptible, less than or equal to 14 mm resistant, and 15 to 17 mm indeterminate. staphylococcus aureus testing with the 30-micrograms disk is not recommended.
in vitro activity of azthreonam, a monobactam antibiotic.
we studied the activity of azthreonam (sq 26,776), a novel monocyclic beta-lactam compound, against a variety of clinical isolates. it was more potent than moxalactam, cefoperazone, cefamandole, cefoxitin, ticarcillin, tobramycin, or amikacin against strains of klebsiella spp., serratia spp., and the proteus group. it was highly effective against escherichia coli and strains of salmonella spp. the median minimal inhibitory concentration for all species of enterobacteriaceae was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. azthreonam was moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, including tobramycin-resistant strains, and against pseudomonas cepacia (median minimal inhibitory concentration, 16 to 32 micrograms/ml), but was weakly active against pseudomonas maltophilia and strains of acinetobacter spp. and achromobacter spp. the drug showed little activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and anaerobic bacteria, including bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., and gram-positive cocci. like moxalactam and cefoperazone, azthreonam exhibited a considerable inoculum effect with strains of enterobacter spp. and pseudomonas spp. combination with clavulanic acid did not increase the activity of azthreonam against s. aureus but was synergistic for 5 of 15 strains of b. fragilis. azthreonam is about 50% bound to human serum protein. the selective range of activity of this compound could be of clinical benefit.
[experimental and clinical evaluation of cefsulodin in the pediatric field].
antimicrobial, pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of cefsulodin (cfs) was made and the following results were obtained. 1. antimicrobial activity of cfs against p. aeruginosa was similar to a little lower than that of gm. antimicrobial activity of cfs against s. aureus was similar to that of sbpc and against e. coli cfs showed lower antimicrobial activity. 2. twenty or 50 mg/kg cfs was administered by 1 hour intravenous drip infusion. average serum levels at the completion of the infusion were 35.1 +/- 8.0, 114.5 +/- 36.1 micrograms/ml and 1.6 +/- 0.7, 4.5 +/- 3.2 micrograms/ml at 6 hours afterward with the half life times of 1.50, 1.29 hours respectively. in case of 12.1 mg/kg 1 hour intravenous drip infusion, peak serum level was 13.4 micrograms/ml at the completion of infusion, and the concentration in the sputum was 1.0 micrograms/ml at 5 hours after completion of infusion. average serum levels of cfs by one shot infusion of 20 mg/kg were 58.4 +/- 6.8 micrograms/ml, 2.7 +/- 2.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 6 hours after injection respectively. half-life time was 1.54 hours. average urinary excretion rates of cfs were 64.4%, 64.2% and 48.9% up to 6 hours after 1 hour intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg cfs and one shot intravenous of 20 mg/kg cfs respectively. 3. cfs was administered to 2 pneumonia cases caused by p. aeruginosa, i.e. one was 15 years and 11 months old male accompanying bronchial asthma and the another 4 years old male with lennox syndrome. neither bacteriological nor clinical efficacy was, however, observed. side effect as well as bacterial superinfection were not observed.
6-acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. ii. antibacterial properties.
the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.
[basic and clinical studies on cefmenoxime in pediatric field].
basic and clinical studies were made on cefmenoxime (cmx) in pediatric field, and the following results were obtained. 1. the antibacterial activity of cmx against clinically isolated and maintained strains was examined. cmx had stronger antibacterial activity than cez against escherichia coli, salmonella, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but cez had stronger antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus. 2. the blood concentrations of cmx, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after a one-shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg of cmx were 33.6, 15.1, 4.5, 2.5 and 0.6 mcg/ml, respectively, with the half-life of 1.04 hours. 3. the blood concentrations of cmx, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg of cmx were 32.0, 55.2, 8.4, 4.2 and 1.0 mcg/ml, respectively, with the half-lite of 0.96 hour. 4. a complete or partial clinical response to therapy with cmx was obtained in all 10 children with infectious diseases. 5. bacteriological examination made on 3 patients showed that all bacteria had been eradicated, and that therapy was effective. the bacteria were e. coli in 2 patients and proteus mirabilis in 1 patient. 6. the side effects produced were neutropenia, eosinophilia and skin eruption in 1 patient, and diarrhea in 1 patient.
a comparison of the antibacterial activities of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) with those of other recently developed beta-lactam derivatives.
the antibacterial activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) was evaluated in 335 clinical isolates of ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, 50 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 28 acinetobacter spp., 50 streptococcus faecalis strains, and 7 oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains and was compared with the recently developed beta-lactam antibiotics mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefazedone, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and moxalactam. among the gram-negative bacteria, n-formimidoyl thienamycin was less active than cefotaxime against klebsiella, serratia, and proteus spp. but had comparable activity against escherichia coli and enterobacter strains. activity of the thienamycin derivative was somewhat lower than that of moxalactam against most of the strains and superior to that of mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and cefoperazone. moreover, n-formimidoyl thienamycin was the most active drug against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. and had activity comparable to that of ampicillin against streptococcus faecalis. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was bactericidal at concentrations less than twice the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) in all gram-negative isolates tested. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci (mic of oxacillin, greater than 4 micrograms/ml) were inhibited at low concentrations of the thienamycin derivative (90% mic, 0.25 micrograms/ml); however, n-formimidoyl thienamycin was not bactericidal at the 90% mic. the antibacterial activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin against all of the gram-negative bacilli was observed to be independent of beta-lactamase production.
in vitro antibacterial activity of e-0702, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin.
e-0702 is an antipseudomonal cephalosporin derivative which has a broad spectrum  of antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. its in vitro antibacterial activities were less than those of cefoperazone and cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, but were significantly high against gram-negative bacteria including the pseudomonas group. it was most characteristic that e-0702 showed high antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. e-0702 was relatively stable to inactivation by plasmid-mediated penicillinases and cephalosporinases produced by gram-negative bacteria.
[susceptibility testing with fosfomycin in an agar diffusion test on mueller-hinton agar].
a disc loading of 50 microgram fosfomycin + 50 microgram glucose-6-phosphate is recommended for disc susceptibility testing. regression analyses for the correlation of the diameter of inhibition zones with the mic result in the following equations. for pseudomonas aeruginosa x = -0.15 y + 16.67 and for enterobacteriacae plus gram-positive cocci x = -0.34 y + 19.55 (x = log2mic + 9; y = diameter of inhibition zone in mm). the correlation coefficients are r = -0.9219 and -0.8627 respectively. the analysis yield the following zone diameter interpretive standards. for pseudomonas aeruginosa less than 12 mm resistant, greater than or equal to 25 mm susceptible, and for enterobacteriaceae plus gram-positive cocci less than 14 mm resistant, greater than or equal to 20 mm susceptible.
comparative activities of 13 beta-lactam antibiotics.
an agar dilution method was used to measure the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 13 beta-lactam antibiotics against 868 recent human clinical isolates. most members of the enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to cefoperazone, ceftazidime, moxalactam, n-formimidoyl thienamycin, ceftriaxone, and ceftizoxime. cephalothin was the most active antibiotic against staphylococcus aureus. most strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by ceftazidime, n-formimidoyl thienamycin, and cefsulodin. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was active against all of the species tested.
activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin and cephalosporins against isolates from nosocomially acquired bacteremia.
the in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin was compared with that of seven beta-lactam agents against bacteremic clinical isolates, including gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci, and enterococci. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was the most active antibiotic against all of the gram-positive cocci studied, with the exception of staphylococcus epidermidis, and the only agent active against the enterococci. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was less active than some of the other agents against enterobacteriaceae, except for the strains of serratia and citrobacter studied. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, n-formimidoyl thienamycin was the most active agent (4 micrograms/ml was the lowest concentration that inhibited 90% of the strains tested).
infection in burn patients.
in a recently opened burn unit which used a semi-isolation technique to treat burn patients, burn bacteriology has shown the usual pattern of bacterial cultures i.e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella and proteus; with the first two predominating. comparison with a similar study done in 1974 revealed that streptococcus faecalis was absent in these cultures, e. coli and s. aureus infection had decreased, the number of sterile wounds had increases, there was slight increase in p. aeruginosa infection. a survey of burn wound, throat and stool cultures of patients and attendants over a 2-week period revealed pathogenic s. aureus in 3 out of 26 throat cultures. phage typing of these strains did not reveal the same strain in any wound cultures. similar phage type was grown from wounds in two different cabins on two different dates. thus indicating cross infection. persistence of similar phage type was also seen in wounds of one patient. similar aeruginocine typing of p. aeruginosa was seen in wound cultures of two different patients; one of these, type 15, was also grown in stool of the third patient thus indicating transmission of infection from the stool of one patient to the wound of other patient and from the wound of one patient to the wound of other patient.
comparative in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin against gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species and its beta-lactamase stability.
the in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. n-formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. it inhibited methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis. it inhibited beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited listeria. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, serratia, indole-positive proteus, acinetobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. there was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration. n-formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against s. aureus, s. faecalis, and many pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae. it was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.

fundamental and clinical studies of ceftizoxime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic,  in children led to the following results. 1. ceftizoxime compared favorably with cefazolin (cez) and cefmetazole (cmz) for in vitro activity against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus (31 strains), escherichia coli (29), klebsiella pneumoniae (30) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (16). while somewhat less active against s. aureus than cez and cmz, ceftizoxime was far more active than these 2 cephalosporin antibiotics against the test strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, which included strains resistant to the 2 drugs. ceftizoxime was not particularly active against ps. aeruginosa, but this seeming disadvantage was offset by the absolute ineffectiveness of the 2 reference drugs on this obstinate organism. 2. the time course of mean serum ceftizoxime levels in 3 pediatric patients of 5--10 years old given a single intravenous dose of 20 mg/kg was as follows: 45.4 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 40.4 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 22.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 10.4 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 2.9 micrograms/ml at 4 hours and 0.9 microgram/ml at 6 hours. the mean serum half life was 1.12 hours. the mean urinary levels of ceftizoxime at serial 2-hour collection intervals were as follows: 2,477 micrograms/ml for 1--2 hours, 1,235 micrograms/ml for 2--4 hours and 462 micrograms/ml for 4--6 hours. the mean urinary recovery up to 6 hours was 61.0%. 3. the clinical response of 28 children with infection to ceftizoxime treatment was 'excellent' in 22 children, 'good' in 4, and 'poor' in 2. these children comprised 11 with acute pneumonia, 3 with acute bronchitis, 4 with acute pyelonephritis, 2 each with acute purulent arthritis and acute enterocolitis, and 1 each with acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent lymphadenitis, furunculosis, subcutaneous abscess, subdural abscess and sepsis. the overall rate of effectiveness was 92.9%. successfully eradicated strains in the bacteriological sense consisted of 4 strains each of h. influenzae and e. coli, 1 strain each of p. morganii, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, 1 of the 2 strains of s. enteritidis, and 1 of the 3 strains of s. aureus. the overall rate of bacteriological effectiveness was 81.3%. no clinical side effects were observed. changes in laboratory test findings included slightly and transiently elevated got and gpt in 1 child and got alone in another child.
antibacterial activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin in comparison with cefotaxime, lamoxactam, cefoperazone, piperacillin gentamicin.
the in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk 0787), a new stable derivative of thienamycin was compared with that of lamoxactam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, piperacillin and gentamicin against 410 clinical isolates of common bacteria. in comparison with the other agents, mk 0787 was more or equally active against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., and serratia spp. it inhibited all isolates at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l, but was less active than cefotaxime and lamoxactam against proteus mirabilis and less active than cefotaxime, lamoxactam and cefoperazone against beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae. strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to n-formimidoyl thienamycin than to other antibiotics.
new anthracycline antibiotics produced by interspecific recombinants of streptomycetes. iv. antimicrobial activity of iremycin.
the in vitro antimicrobial activity of iremycin (10-(alpha-l-rhodosaminyl)-gamma-rhodomycinone) was determined in comparison to that of doxorubicin, a 14-hydroxy-derivative of daunorubicin, which exhibited a strong antitumor activity and is useful in chemotherapy of human tumors. the mic values determined by means of a standardized agar diffusion plate test indicated a lower antimicrobial activity of iremycin in vitro in comparison to that of doxorubicin. in contrast to doxorubicin, iremycin was highly active against mycobacterium smegmatis, but five-fold less active than doxorubicin against staphylococcus aureus, seven-fold less active against bacillus subtilis, and twenty five-fold less active against commamonas terrigena. furthermore, iremycin was hundred-fold less active against a highly sensitive permeation mutant of pseudomonas aeruginosa. no inducing activity on prophages in lysogenic e. coli cells was demonstrable for iremycin and no growth inhibition in the repair test was observable. in contrast, iremycin inhibited the multiplication of gamma-phages in the bip test, but the mic values of violamycin bi, doxorubicin and iremycin in this test system indicated that iremycin is two hundred fifty-fold less active than violamycin bi and ten-fold less active than doxorubicin. no serum binding was demonstrable for iremycin.
in vitro antimicrobial activity evaluation of cefodizime (hr221), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin.
cefodizime (hr221) is a new alpha-methoxyimino cephalosporin developed by hoechst-roussel with a reported serum half-life of over 2 h. in vitro susceptibility studies showed that the cefodizime spectrum includes all those enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, streptococcus spp., haemophilus spp., and neisseria spp. normally susceptible to cefotaxime (hr756) or ceftizoxime (fk749) or both. cefodizime was less active (two- to eightfold) than cefotaxime or ceftizoxime against some enteric species, but was the most potent drug against some strains of morganella spp. and proteus vulgaris. enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and most pseudomonas spp. were resistant to cefodizime (median minimum inhibitory concentrations, greater than or equal to 64 microgram/ml). acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains required cefodizime concentrations of 32 microgram/ml to inhibit 50% of tested strains. cefodizime was very stable to hydrolysis by richmond-sykes type i, ii, iii, and iv beta-lactamases, as well as the enzyme derived from bacillus cereus. the reference padac and nitrocefin substrate hydrolysis by a type i beta-lactamase was markedly inhibited (greater than 80%) by cefodizime at concentrations 0.4 to 4% of substrate concentration. cefodizime was active against 43% of bacteria which were resistant to cephalothin and cefamandole and against 58% of those resistant to aminoglycosides.
the in-vitro activity of ceftazidime against clinically important pathogens.
a total of 1414 strains of gram-negative bacilli and 250 strains of gram-positive cocci were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the broth dilution method. the strains were clinical isolates from 26 hospitals in the rhein-main area. all the strains were tested against ceftazidime and ten other cephalosporin antibiotics. ceftazidime was found to exhibit an in-vitro activity against enterobacteriaceae similar to that of cefotaxime, moxalactam and other new members of the cephalosporin class, but was more active against acinetobacter species. ceftazidime shows extremely high activity both against carbenicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. similarly, ampicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae are susceptible to ceftazidime. the activity of ceftazidime against staphylococcus aureus is limited and, like other cephalosporins, it is inactive against streptococcus faecalis.
ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8 mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.
ceftazidime: comparative in-vitro study.
ceftazidime showed moderate activity against staphylococcus aureus and a high activity against haemophilus influenzae and the streptococci except against the enterococci. ceftazidime inhibited 90% of the 830 enterobacteriaceae tested at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l and 99% at 8 mg/l, an activity very similar to that of cefotaxime. against pseudomonas spp. ceftazidime proved to be the most active beta-lactam antibiotic studied. it inhibited 67% of the 141 ps. aeruginosa strains at 2 mg/l, 84% at 4 mg/l, 98% at 8 mg/l and 100% at 16 mg/l. the inhibitory and the bactericidal concentrations were very close and there was only a minor effect of the inoculum. ceftazidime retained its high activity against microorganisms with acquired as well as with natural resistance to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
ceftazidime: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases compared with that of cefotaxime, moxalactam and other beta-lactam antibiotics.
the in-vitro antibacterial activity of ceftazidime was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria and also against reference strains that produced known beta-lactamases. the compound was active, though less so than cephaloridine against staphylococci and streptococci with mics mostly 0.12-2 mg/l for streptococci and 8 mg/l for staphylococci, but enterococci (mics > or =64 mg/l) and methicillin-resistant staphylococci (mics 16-32 mg/l) were resistant. penicillin-resistant pneumococci (mics 2-4 mg/l) were much less sensitive than other pneumococci (mics 0.12-0.25 mg/l). ceftazidime was also active, but slightly less so than cefotaxime or moxalactam, against enterobacteria (mics mostly 0.12-0.25 mg/l). its activity was also inferior to that of cefotaxime against neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly 0.03-0.06 mg/l) and haemophilus influenzae (mics mostly 0.06-0.25 mg/l). however it was about eightfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics mostly 1-4 mg/l), and it was also more active than these compounds against other pseudomonads. ceftazidime was less active than cefoxitin against bacteroides spp. (mics mostly 16-64 mg/l for bact. fragilis and 2-8 mg/l for other bacteroides) and less active than ampicillin or cefoxitin against other anaerobes. the compound was highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases including oxa-1 and the enzymes from klebsiella 1082e and proteus vulgaris pc37 which hydrolyse cefuroxime and cefotaxime. however, it was hydrolysed slowly by the enzyme from a highly ampicillin-resistant isolate of bact. fragilis.
regrowth of pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria after the bactericidal action of carbenicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics.
exposure of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus to bactericidal concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics in broth culture resulted in a decrease in viability over the first 6--8 hr, followed by regrowth which was not due to the selection of resistant variants or loss of antibiotic potency. during incubation, bacteria adhered to the surface of the culture vessel and multiplied despite the presence of bactericidal concentrations of antibiotic in the medium. it is concluded that the phenomenon of "regrowth" results from such adhesion and the subsequent dispersal of some of these cells into the culture medium. the significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the treatment of infection, the determination of minimal bactericidal concentrations, and the phenomena of tolerance and persisters.
microbial flora of in-use, display eye shadow testers and bacterial challenges of unused eye shadows.
we surveyed 15 different brands of eye shadow on display for customer use in different retail stores for microbial contamination. this was the first reported microbial surveillance of in-use eye shadow display testers in retail establishments. cultures were obtained at each retail store. sterile dacron swabs were rolled and rubbed over the entire used surface of each shadow, and each inoculum was streaked onto the surfaces of blood agar plates. of the 1,345 individual samples obtained, 67% were contaminated with one or more species of microorganisms representing the genera staphylococcus, micrococcus, corynebacterium, acinetobacter, bacillus, and moraxella. we also purchased two different brands of water-miscible eye shadows in replicate unit containers. each brand was challenged separately with a few hundred to several thousand colony-forming units of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or acinetobacter calcoaceticus. both brands permitted growth of p. aeruginosa but not growth of s. aureus. a. calcoaceticus was inhibited after inoculation into one brand. with the other brand, the inoculum of acinetobacter multiplied in one of the two different lots tested. this experimental challenge procedure can serve as a useful model system for studying the behavior of microbes in eye shadows and similar matrices.
increased serum antibacterial activity after turpentine-induced acute inflammation.
an acute inflammatory response was induced in rabbits by an intramuscular injection of turpentine. after this injection serial serum samples were obtained and serum haptoglobin levels were monitored. in addition, increased antibacterial activity was measured using a viable plate and photometric growth assay. as early as 4 hrs after turpentine challenge an increase was noted in serum antibacterial activity towards staphylococcus aureus. at 48 hrs pronounced killing activity was demonstrated against s. aureus and s. epidermidis but not against escherichia coli or other gram negative bacilli. by five days another serum bactericidal activity was present against bacillus subtilis. enhanced serum antibacterial activity persisted for 2 weeks. partial characterization of these factors indicates that they are probably beta lysins.
comparative in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephalosporins.
minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined against 662 recent clinical isolates for eight cephalosporins representing first, second and third generation compounds. all four third-generation cephalosporins tested (cefoperaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and moxalactam) were significantly more active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria than the older compounds (cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime). cefotaxime and moxalactam were most active against enterobacteriaceae with extremely low mic-values. ceftazidime was definitely most active against pseudomonas aeruginosa with more than 90% of strains inhibited at 4 micro g/ml. mic-values for cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus were for all strains 1-2 micro g/ml, slightly higher for cefoperazone, while the effect of ceftazidime and moxalactam was more limited. all third generation cephalosporins demonstrated efficiency against streptococcus pyogenes, cefotaxime being most active and moxalactam least active, but were essentially ineffective against streptococcus faecalis. moxalactam demonstrated higher activity against bacteroides fragilis than other second and third generation cephalosporins including cefoxitin. previous studies have demonstrated a very high activity of all third generation cephalosporins against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains.
beta-lactamase stability and antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365), a  novel cephalosporin.
cefmenoxime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, has been shown to be stable to a staphylococcus aureus penicillinase and r plasmid-mediated type i and type iv penicillinases. it was also resistant to hydrolysis by most cephalosporinases, but was susceptible to hydrolysis by a proteus vulgaris beta-lactamase. cefmenoxime was active against cephaloridine-resistant species, except pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was moderately resistant to cefmenoxime. cefmenoxime was an inducer of p. vulgaris beta-lactamase biosynthesis, but 1 microgram or more of the drug per ml, which inhibits most of the clinical isolates of p. vulgaris, was required for the production of detectable amounts of the enzyme. cefmenoxime was a strong competitive inhibitor of beta-lactamases of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, p. aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, but it did not inhibit penicillinases in spite of its resistance to hydrolysis.
antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of s. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less than 0.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less active than cefoperazone against pseudomonas aeruginosa. presence of serum, alteration of ph, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels. bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some enterobacter, proteus, and bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.
antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365).
the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the enterobacteriaceae. the mic(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for s. aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. cefmenoxime was very active against haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis with mic(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., respectively. mics for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. in addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. the combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the enterobacteriaceae and 100% of p. aeruginosa strains tested. development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial mics but more rapid for those with higher initial mics. cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or s. aureus but was less effective against p. aeruginosa.
comparative in vitro studies of ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative.
the in vitro activity of ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative, was compared with the activities of cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against 591 clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. the spectra of activity and potency of ro 13-9904 and cefotaxime were quite similar; they were the most active agents against enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis. moxalactam was only slightly less active against these organisms. ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam were approximately equal in activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa; concentrations of 50 to 100 microgram/ml inhibited over 90% of the strains tested. cefamandole and cephalothin were the most active drugs tested against staphylococci. moxalactam demonstrated the highest intrinsic activity against bacteroides fragilis; a concentration of 1.6 microgram/ml inhibited over 50% of the strains. all six of the antibiotics were essentially inactive against group d streptococci. the action of all of the antibiotics was bactericidal, with minimal bactericidal concentrations generally being no more than twofold greater than minimal inhibitory concentrations. the only exception to this was found when large inocula of staphylococcus aureus were tested. increased inoculum size generally sharply reduced the activity of ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa.
in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin in comparison with cefotaxime, moxalactam, and ceftazidime.
the in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (n-f-thienamycin) was compared with the activities of other b-lactam antibiotics, using over 500 clinical bacterial isolates. n-f-thienamycin inhibited 90% of the isolates of the common enterobacteriaceae between 0.006 and 2 microgram/ml, regardless of their resistance to amoxicillin, ticarcillin, or cephalothin. it was, however, fourfold less active than moxalactam and ceftazidime and eightfold less active than cefotaxime. n-f-thienamycin was nearly as active as ceftazidime against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mean minimal inhibitory concentration, 3.0 microgram/ml) and eightfold more active than cefotaxime and moxalactam. in contrast to cefotaxime, moxalactam, and ceftazidime, n-f-thienamycin was highly active against enterococci (mean minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.3 microgram/ml) and staphylococci. the oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus were inhibited between 0.03 and 0.12 microgram/ml, and the oxacillin-resistant s. aureus were inhibited between 0.12 and 2 microgram/ml. the high activity of n-f-thienamycin against both of the most important gram-positive and gram-negative organisms makes it a very promising new antibiotic.
in vitro activity of ro 13-9904, a new beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of ro 13-9904 against 245 clinical isolates was determined by an agar dilution method. the activity of ro 13-9904 against most enterobacteriaceae was similar to that of cefotaxime; it was slightly more active than cefotaxime against proteus mirabilis, providencia species, and serratia marcescens, but slightly less active against klebsiella species. ro 13-9904 was twofold more active than cefotaxime and threefold more active than ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a mean mic of 7.2 micrograms/ml; isolates highly resistant to ticarcillin were inhibited by a mean mic of 17.2 micrograms/ml. ro 13-9904 was fourfold more active than ampicillin against susceptible haemophilus influenzae and was equally active against beta-lactamase-producing isolates. ro 13-9904 was highly active against pneumococci and moderately active (mic, 4 micrograms/ml) against staphylococcus aureus isolates, whether they were susceptible or resistant to penicillin g. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus and streptococcus faecalis were completely resistant to ro 13-9904 (mic, greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
[bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa in serum and bronchial secretion in  patients under continuous infusion of azlocillin].
the azlocillin level and killing activity in serum and bronchial secretions against 10 strains of p. aeruginosa were studied in 7 intubated or tracheotomized patients with severe bronchial infection who were receiving the drug as continuous i.v. infusion. in 5 out of 7 patients azlocillin was absent or present only in traces in bronchial secretions in spite of plasma levels ranging between 170 to 340 micrograms/ml. in the other 3 patients azlocillin levels of 23 and 39 micrograms/ml and moderate bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa could be detected in bronchial secretions. penicillinase producing strains of staph. aureus were isolated from the sputum of the 5 patients with extremely low azlocillin level in bronchial secretions. the strain of staph. aureus isolated from one patient was shown to destroy azlocillin rapidly. in bronchopulmonary infections, staph. aureus may not only be directly pathogenic but also interfere with the action of beta-lactamase unstable drugs against other microorganisms.
[about the antimicrobial activity of substituted aromatic aldehydes (author's transl)].
the mic-values and the antimicrobial activity in the paper disc diffusion method  of 86 resp. 79 substituted aromatic aldehydes have been investigated. antibacterial activity has been tested against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and klebsiella pneumoniae, the antifungal activity against trichophyton mentagrophytes, aspergillus niger and candida albicans. 13 classes of substituents have been investigated. the most active compounds are substituted with nitro-, hydroxy- and halogen groups.
antibacterial and antifungal activities of benzimidazole and benzoxazole derivatives.
the in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of six benzimidazole and benzoxazole derivatives were tested against standard strains and 59 clinical isolates. of the six compounds, only compounds ii and iii (both benzoxazoles) were active, whereas the rest were devoid of any activity. considerable growth inhibition of all of the standard strains, including fungi and gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, resulted when they were treated with these compounds. fifty-nine clinical isolates of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were tested for susceptibility to the two compounds. the most susceptible were the s. aureus isolates. the two compounds were of comparable activity against all of the isolates, with compound iii showing a slightly higher activity than compound ii. their respective minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% inhibition of s. aureus were 25 and 50 microgram/ml. the gram-negative bacteria were resistant to the two compounds and required minimal inhibitory concentrations of 200 microgram/ml for a similar degree of inhibition.
the control of burn wound sepsis.
this presentation reviews the course of burn wound sepsis in a group of 621 acute patients treated at the shriners burns institute, cincinnati unit, between 1970 and 1976. during this period of time, the overall mortality rate fell from 14% in 1970 to 3 and 5%, respectively, in 1975 and 1976. staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly recovered organism from the burn wound, colonizing 85% of the burn patients. beta hemolytic streptococcus represented a potential threat despite the fact that it was recovered from only 5 to 10% of the patients. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a decrease in colonization during the period of this study, from 50% of the wounds in 1970 to 21% in 1976. candida albicans was the fungal organism most commonly recovered from the burn wound and from the blood stream. fifteen deaths occurred in this group as a result of invasive infection, one from s. aureus, five from p. aeruginosa, two from klebsiella-enterobacter, and one from escherichia coli, as well as six fungal deaths, five from candida albicans and one from mucormycosis. therapeutic measures used to control burn wound sepsis consisted of prevention of contamination from exogenous sources, control of burn wound pathogens, early recognition of invasive burn wound sepsis, aggressive management of the burn wound, and optimal nutritional support. during this period the extent of burn associated with a survival of 50% has risen from 50% in 1970 to 80% in 1976. this improvement in survival is directly related to progressive improvement in local and systemic measures available for the control of infection.
origin and spread of pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus and klebsiella during twenty years in an infectious hospital.
bacteriological examinations carried out in an infectious hospital revealed that  the occurrence of pseudomonas and proteus grew 4-fold, and the rate of klebsiella positive cultures 3.5-fold between 1958 and 1977. on the other hand, the occurrence of staphylococcus aureus decreased to the half since 1961. the occurrence of gram-negative facultative pathogens started to increase in the surgical wards in the fifties and the rise lasted until the mid-sixties. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent among them. in contrast, escherichia coli dominated and p. aeruginosa was the least frequent in the non-surgical wards. here the gram-negative facultative pathogens showed a more rapid increase and the incidence of p. aeruginosa and proteus kept rising throughout the whole examination period. when gram-negative facultative pathogens of hospital origin were colonizing, the proportion of sick persons versus symptomless carriers was significantly higher than in the case of extrahospital colonization on the basis of the records of 300 p. aeruginosa, 300 proteus and 300 klebsiella positive patients. this proportion changed parallel with the rate of the strains of hospital origin. the number of patients who acquired p. aeruginosa, proteus or klebsiella extrahospitally, kept continuously rising between 1958 and 1971. thus, the advance of gram-negative facultative pathogens is due not ony to nosocomial causes.
facilitating quality control of the antimicrobial susceptibility test.
standard reference strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were suspended in sterile deionized water and tested daily via disk agar diffusion for their antimicrobial susceptibilities. inocula of e. coli and p. aeruginosa yielded acceptable results for up to 32 days; however, results on s. aureus were unacceptable due to loss of viability of the organism in water. e. coli and p. aeruginosa inocula, in water, can be used daily for quality control of the disk gear diffusion test.
in vitro comparison of three new cephalosporins: ly-127935, cefotaxime and cefoperazone.
the comparative in vitro activity of three new cephalosporin antibiotics ly-127935 (ly), cefotaxime (ctx) and cefoperazone (cfp) was examined. ly, ctx and cfp had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis while cfp was less inhibitory than ly or ctx against klebsiella spp.; indole + proteus and gentamicin (gm)-susceptible serratia. ly and ctx were effective while cfp was inactive against enterobacter spp. and gm-resistant serratia. cfp was more active than ly or ctx against gm-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa but was the least active agent against gm-resistant isolates. bacteroides fragilis were more susceptible to ly than ctx or cfp. combination studies against p. aeruginosa with cephalosporin-gm pairs demonstrated synergy.
ci-867, a new semisynthetic penicillin: in vitro studies.
ci-867, a new semisynthetic penicillin, has exhibited broad-spectrum activity in  vitro against gram-positive cocci, except penicillin g-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and against gram-negative bacilli. it was especially active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and as active as mezlocillin and piperacillin against klebsiella pneumoniae. ci-867 was bactericidal against most organisms. its activity was greatly reduced when the inoculum was increased from 10(5) to 10(7) organisms per ml.
antimicrobial activity of street heroin.
street heroin and injection paraphernalia have been implicated as sources of bacteria causing infections in drug abusers [1]. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus are common etiologic agents. in a previous study of the microbiology of street heroin and injection paraphernalia, bacillus species was the predominant isolate [2]. we did not find s. aureus, but one study reported isolates of identical phage type from heroin powder and from an infected patient [3]. to reconcile the results of our recent investigation among drug abusers with panophthalmitis, we theorized that the drug mixture might have an antibacterial effect. of the samples of street heroin tested, all except one were bactericidal against s. aureus. the single sample with no heroin content was not bactericidal against one isolate of s. aureus and was the only sample that exhibited some degree of inhibitory and bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa. all samples were bactericidal against the two isolates of b. cereus tested. quinine exhibited bactericidal activity against s. aureus and b. cereus but was ineffective against p. aeruginosa. our findings indicate that most samples of street heroin have antibacterial effects against s. aureus and b. cereus but no activity against p. aeruginosa. such activity may be due to the quinine content of the mixture. the apparent lack of recovery of s. aureus from street heroin may be partially explained by this phenomenon.
compound a49759, the 3-o-demethyl derivative of fortimicin a: in vitro comparison with six other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
o-demethylfortimicin a (compound a49759) was tested against 445 bacteria, and the results were compared with those obtained with fortimicin a, amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin. a49759 was found to be active and bactericidal against the enterobacteriaceae, nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, and staphylococcus aureus. a49759 was two- to fourfold more active than fortimicin a against most species tested, but generally fourfold less active than amikacin against this population of pseudomonas aeruginosa (85% inhibited at less than or equal to 16 microgram of amikacin per ml and 85% inhibited at less than or equal to 64 microgram of a49759 per ml). only amikacin and a49759 were resistant to most aminoglucoside-inactivating enzymes and also had significant antipseudomonal activity. amikacin was inactivated by aminoglycoside 6'-acetyltransferase, and a49759 was inactivated by aminoglycoside 3-acetyltransferase. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of all tested aminoglycosides were increased by augmenting the inoculum size.
comparative antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a, a derivative of fortimicin a.
the in vitro antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a (odmf), a derivative of fortimicin a, was compared with those of fortimicin a and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. all three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus, with odmf most active against proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus, and providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. activity of each of the antibiotics against group d streptococci was poor. the overall activity of odmf was superior to that of fortimicin a for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. both odmf and fortimicin a were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the exception of 3-n-acetyltransferase-i. odmf and fortimicin a showed similar rapid bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin g. the combination of carbenicillin with odmf, fortimicin a, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested. inactivation of odmf and fortimicin a when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. odmf, fortimicin a, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, s. aureus, or p. aeruginosa. gentamicin was the most active, followed by odmf and fortimicin a. the superior in vitro activity of odmf compared with fortimicin a against p. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.
in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin g, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. all of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. more than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of staphylococcus aureus and 80% of s. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by n-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. it inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than ticarcillin. all 16 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. the marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it a promising new antibiotic.
comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against salmonella typhi.
piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of salmonella typhi. piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. the relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. in addition, piperacillin was assessed in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. this investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae, neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. s. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) cfu, and inocula of 10(2) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) cfu. piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. combinations of piperacillin with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against pseudomonas and serratia isolates. less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against klebsiella and indole-positive proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.
[fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case, the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime, a new cephalosporin.
cefotaxime, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative, showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against clinically isolated strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. this cephalosporin was slightly less active than cefazolin against staphylococcus aureus but 4 to 300 times as active as carbenicillin against gram-negative organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens. cefotaxime was the most active compound against members of the enterobacteriaceae and 20- to 100-fold more active than cefoxitin against the indole-positive proteus group. the minimal bactericidal concentrations of the compound were identical to, or two times higher than, the minimal inhibitory concentrations against escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa and four times higher against s. marcescens. a reduction of inoculum size decreased greatly the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of cefotaxime against e. coli p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens. the antibiotic was very stable to penicillinase and cephalosporinase produced by gram-negative bacteria, including proteus vulgaris.
antibacterial activities of a new stabilized thienamycin, n-formimidoyl thienamycin, in comparison with other antibiotics.
the in vitro activity of a new crystalline derivative of thienamycin, n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787), was tested against 46 laboratory reference strains and 2,158 clinical isolates of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobes, and compared with cefoxitin, cefaxolin, carbenicillin, and amikacin. mk0787 was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against most bacteria tests. mk0787 was 16- to 500-fold more active than the other antibiotics against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and group a and group b streptococci, inhibiting most isolates at concentrations less than 0.031 micrograms/ml. the inhibition concentration against over 90% of 156 strains of streptococcus faecalis was 1 micrograms/ml. mk0787 had slightly less activity than carbenicillin against haemophilus influenzae. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of mk0787 against strains of enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., serratia marcescems. pseudomonas aeruginosa, and clostridium difficile that are resistant to currently available antibiotics were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. the only species found resistant to mk0787 was pseudomonas maltophilia, which was equally nonsusceptible to the other reference antibiotics.
gr 20263, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin with anti-pseudomonal activity.
gr 20263 is a new broad-spectrum injectable cephalosporin which is stable to most beta-lactamases. its in vitro activities were of the same order as those of cefotaxime against most gram-negative bacteria, were clearly inferior to cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus, but were significantly more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against the 25 strains used, gr 20263 was significantly more active than any of the other agents tested: piperacillin, azlocillin, gentamicin, amikacin, and carbenicillin. gr 20263 protected mice against experimental infections with p. aeruginosa more effectively than other beta-lactam antibiotics; its general effectiveness in this test was comparable with gentamicin. studies on human volunteers showed that it produces high, long-lasting blood levels, with much of the antibiotic being recovered in the urine. intramuscular and intravenous injections were well tolerated by the volunteers, and there were no untoward side effects.
uk31214, a new aminoglycoside and derivative of kanamycin b.
the in vitro activity of uk31214, a kanamycin b derivative, was studied against 250 recent isolates and compared with other aminoglycosides. against the enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii) uk31214 and amikacin had similar degrees of activity (mode minimum inhibitory concentration [mic], 1 microgram/ml). proteus mirabilis and p. stuartii strains were four- to eight-fold more susceptible to amikacin than to uk31214. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were equally susceptible to both amikacin and uk31214 (mode mic, 4 microgram/ml), but tobramycin was the most active antimicrobial agent tested (mode mic, 0.25 microgram/ml). the gentamicin-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa were equally susceptible to uk31214 and amikacin. strains of staphylococcus aureus were more susceptible to gentamicin or tobramycin than to uk31214 or amikacin (mode mic, 0.5 microgram/ml). a synergistic interaction between uk31214 and carbenicillin was demonstrated.
comparison of in vitro activity of moxalactam (ly127935) with cefazolin, amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin against 420 blood culture isolates.
to compare the in vitro activity of moxalactam (ly127935), a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, with cefazolin, amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, each drug was tested against 420 bacterial isolates from the blood of septic patients. standard broth dilution methods were used to determine minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations. ly127935 was as active as the aminoglycosides against aerobic gram-negative organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was at least 10-fold more active than the other beta-lactam agents against these bacteria. ly127935 was the most active agent tested against bacteroides fragilis; its activity against all other anaerobic bacteria and staphylococcus aureus was similar to those of the other agents tested. all streptococci, however, grew at higher concentrations of ly127935 than any other drug, and streptococcus faecalis and listeria monocytogenes were not inhibited at the highest concentration tested (minimum inhibitory concentration, > 64 microgram/ml). although a greater proportion of blood culture isolates were susceptible to ly127935 than to any other drug tested, ly127935 does not have a sufficiently broad spectrum of in vitro activity to be recommended safely alone for empirical treatment of sepsis of unknown etiology.
inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa slime production by staphylococcal extracellular product.
staphylococcus aureus produced an inhibitory factor that suppressed slime formation by psuudomonas aeruginosa but had little effect on the growth of the organism. the inhibitory factor was not found in broth cultures but could be extracted from cultures grown on solid agar. the inhibitory factor moderately inhibited gram-negative bacteria in addition to inhibiting a variety of gram-positive bacteria. the inhibitory factor was found to have a low molecular weight, as judged by its diffusibility, and it could be partially purified by gel filtration on sephadex g-50. it was observed to be heat labile; however, its activity was stable within a wide ph range. the factor was resistant to deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, and lipase, but sensitive to trypsin. the role of the inhibition of slime production in pathogenicity is discussed.
activity of the cefotaxime (hr756) desacetyl metabolite compared with those of cefotaxime and other cephalosporins.
the desacetyl metabolite (des) of cefotaxime (hr756) is formed in vivo to a significant extent. the in vitro activities of des, the parent compound, and cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime were compared against 70 bacterial isolates. des was found to possess approximately 1/10th the activity of the parent compound against the common enterobacteriaceae, but was somewhat more active than the other three compounds tested. des had no useful activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and was less active than cefotaxime or cefoxitin against staphylococcus aureus or bacteroides fragilis. because des may accumulate in renal failure or be concentrated in the biliary tract, its antimicrobial activity may have considerable clinical significance.
bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
the bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. no bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. the total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 candida albicans. of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. a higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. more isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. the rate of isolation staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and propionibacterium acnes increased, and the rate of isolation of escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.
effect of irgasan on bacterial growth and its adsorption into the cell wall.
isolated cell walls and whole cells of e. coli, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were  shown to adsorb irgasan, with p. aeruginosa adsorbing the greatest amount of irgasan per microgram of cell wall and whole cell tested. the drug uptake displayed by both cell walls and whole cells appears to be by diffusion. although p. aeruginosa revealed the highest affinity for the bisphenol of the three organisms tested, it was most resistant to its antibacterial action. these results indicated that the lipid content of the cell wall may be responsible for the degree of adsorption and resistance since p. aeruginosa showed the most adsorption, resistance and the highest cell wall lipid content of the three micro-organisms tested.
antimicrobial activity of heparin.
single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. at heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 u/ml, the effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. all 10 isolates of s. aureus and all 10 of s. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 u/ml. three e. coli, four p. aeruginosa, and nine c. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 u of heparin per ml. none of the k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 u/ml. heparin inhibition of s. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 u of heparin per ml could be quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. these data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.
[fosfomycin, a new antibiotic: in vitro activity compared with mezlocillin, cefuroxime and gentamicin].
in vitro investigations with fosfomycin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and gentamicin  against staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae an pseudomonadaceae were carried out by agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar. the fosfomycin breakpoint for the low dosage of 2-3 times 3 g per infusion daily was defined with 16 micro g/ml and for the high dosage of 2-3 times 5 g fosfomycin per infusion with 64 micro g/ml. at a concentration of 16 micro g/l fosfomycin more than 90% of the cultures of staph. aureus (penicillin-resistant), e. coli, proteus mirabilis an proteus vulgaris examined were inhibited. at a concentration of less than 64 micro g/ml fosfomycin 80 toi 100% of the cultures of serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morgani et rettgeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gentamicin sensitive and resistant) were inhibited. fosfomycin showed an absolute stability against many beta-lactamases of different bacterial species.
in vitro antibacterial activity of moxalactam, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic.
the antibacterial activity of moxalactam was studied in vitro against 229 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms using the agar dilution technique. mueller-hinton agar was used as growth medium. the results were compared to those obtained with cefamandole. all isolates of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by moxalactam at a concentration of 8 microgram/ml or less. the concentrations of cefamandole with which the same effect was obtained were 0.5 microgram/ml and 2 microgram/ml respectively. moxalactam was highly inhibitory against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus morganii - 90% of the strains were inhibited by 0.125 microgram/ml. moxalactam was highly superior against proteus rettgeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are usually resistant to cefamandole: the mic100 and mic90 were 0.25 microgram/ml and 8 microgram/ml respectively. high sensitivity was found in strains of salmonella species, nine of which were salmonella typhi: the mic90 was < 0.063 microgram/ml versus the eightfold higher concentration of cefamandole. the broad-spectrum activity and unusual mic patterns of moxalactam - eight or manyfold higher concentrations of cefamandole were needed to inhibit 90% of most gram-negative strains studied - make moxalactam an unusual and promising antibiotic.
in vitro activity of piperacillin compared with that of ampicillin, ticarcillin,  azlocillin, and mezlocillin.
the antibacterial activity of ampicillin, ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin and piperacillin was investigated in 1112 fresh clinical isolates using the microdilution technic. ampicillin was the most active agent against enterococci and ticarcillin against staphylococcus aureus, 91% of the latter being inhibited by 32 mg/l. 95% of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were susceptible to piperacillin and 90% to ticarcillin and azlocillin. piperacillin was still active against half of the azlocillin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. against the enterobacteriaceae, mezlocillin and piperacillin were equally active: 31% of these strains were resistant to both drugs. amongst the various strains the percentage of resistance was highest in klebsiella (60%). analysis of resistance patterns of enterobacteriaceae showed almost completely parallel resistance between these two drugs the difference being less than 3%. piperacillin, however, had the broadest spectrum of all the penicillins tested.
pseudomonas cepacia resistance to antibacterials.
reproducible growth rates of pseudomonas cepacia were obtained. p. cepacia had a  markedly different resistance pattern to single and combined antibacterials from that characteristic of pseudomonas aeruginosa. benzalkonium and chlorhexidine were more active against log phase p. cepacia than against log phase p. aeruginosa, but polymyxin b sulfate was inactive against log phase p. cepacia at all concentrations tested (smaller than or equal to 16 units/ml). antagonism of antibacterial activity between edetate disodium-benzalkonium and edetate disodium-chlorhexidine combinations was marked with 16-hr p. cepacia and with 16-hr staphylococcus aureus. phenylethanol-benzalkonium and phenylethanolchlorhexidine combinations had no more than additive activity against log phase p. cepacia. these results have relevance to hospital disinfection and preservation of pharmaceutical solutions.
ly127935, a novel oxa-beta-lactam: an in vitro comparison with other beta-lactam  antibiotics.
the in vitro activities of ly127935 (ly) were compared with those of other beta-lactam antibiotics. ly was highly active (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic] range 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml) against the common enterobacteriaceae (including providencia stuartiia, enterobacter, and serrati marcescens), 8 to 16 times more active than cefoxitin, cefuroxime, or cefazolin, and from one-half to one-eighth as active as cefotaxime (hr756). the activity of ly against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 4 and 64 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of test strains, respectively) was essentially similar to that of cefotaxime, but was only one-half as active as cgp 7174/e. ly, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime were essentially equally active against bacteroides fragilis--each was more active than cefuroxime and cefazolin. against staphylococcus aureus, ly (50% mic and 90% mic of 4 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively) was less active than cefotaxime, cefoxitin, or cefuroxime and one-eighth as active as cefazolin. the composition and ph of the culture medium had little effect on the activity of ly, although 7.2 appeared to be the optimum ph.
comparative activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefoperazone, a piperazine cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of 7-[d(-)-alpha-(4-ethyl-2,3-dioxopiperazino-carbonylamino) -p-hydroxyphenylacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl)-5-tetrazolylthiomethyl] -delta(3)-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (cefoperazone), a cephalosporin analog of piperacillin, were compared with the activities and stabilities of other cephalosporins and cephamycins. the compound was less active than cephalothin or cefamandole in inhibiting staphylococcus aureus; it was as active as cefamandole and cefoxitin against most of the enterobacteriaceae but less active than cefotaxime. it was more active than carbenicillin or piperacillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in general, the compound was not active against bacteroides. it was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamases of some escherichia coli which hydrolyzed cefamandole, but was stable to most plasmid-mediated, chromosomally mediated, inducible beta-lactamases in the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas.
diffusion disk susceptibility testing with cefotaxime.
the diffusion disk susceptibility of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime was determined. a 30-mug disk provided data for the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa, but yielded extremely large zones of inhibition against enterobacteriaceae. a 5-mug disk seemed to provide the most useful susceptibility data for s. aureus and enterobacteriaceae.
antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin--hr 756: comparison with cefamandole and ceforanide.
hr 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin that is beta-lactamase resistant, was tested against 271 bacterial isolates. both agar and broth dilution testing were employed, using two media and two inoculum sizes of bacteria. antibacterial activity of the drug was compared to that of cefamandole (cfm) and ceforanide (cfn). in agar, hr 756 was more active than cfm and cfn against all bacteria tested except isolates of staphylococcus aureus, which were better inhibited by cfm. hr 756 exhibited some antipseudomonas activity in agar, although a marked inoculum effect was apparent. a comparison of median minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations in broth showed again that hr 756 was the most active of these three drugs. hr 756 demonstrated enhanced antibacterial activity compared to cfm and cfn against bacteria sensitive to all three drugs as well as against more resistant isolates of serratia marcescens, enterobacter species, and indole-positive proteus. as with other cephalosporins, results for most bacteria were affected by inoculum size, medium, and type of dilution test employed in in vitro studies.
phosphonopeptides as antibacterial agents: mechanism of action of alaphosphin.
the novel antibacterial peptide mimetic alaphosphin (l-alanyl-l-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid) selectively inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. it induced accumulation of uridine diphosphate-n-acetyl-muramyl-tripeptide in gram-positive organisms and significantly reduced the intracellular pool levels of d-alanine. alaphosphin was actively transported into bacterial cells by stereospecific peptide permeases and was subsequently hydrolyzed by intracellular aminopeptidases to yield l-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid. this alanine mimetic rapidly accumulated inside susceptible cells to yield a concentration which was 100- to 1,000-fold in excess of that of the precursor peptide in the surrounding medium. in the case of susceptible gram-negative organisms, it was shown that 1-aminoethylphosphonic acid was incorporated into a metabolite which was tentatively identified as uridine diphosphate-n-acetylmuramyl-aminoethylphosphonate. the primary intracellular target site of 1-aminoethylphosphonic acid was alanine racemase (ec 5.1.1.1), which was reversibly and competitively inhibited in the gram-negative organisms escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and irreversibly inhibited in a time-dependent manner in the gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. a secondary target site could be uridine diphosphate-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine synthetase [ec 6.3.2.8(b)]. the mechanism of action of alaphosphin may be regarded as involving at least three stages: (i) active transport by peptide permeases; (ii) intracellular peptidase cleavage; and (iii) action of l-1-aminoethylphosphonate on alanine racemase.
[antibacterial effect of ankerplast spray].
the diffusion test yielded no satisfactory results. in the tube test, both the spray and the solvent (in a dilution of 1:4 and 1:8, respectively) proved to be bacteriostatically active against enterococci, staphylococcus aureus, escheria coli, proteus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. these germs were killed within 30 minutes in the test for bactericidal activity, whereas the reference substance (1% phenol) required 1--2 hours, except against the last-named germ. even the copolymer exerted a bactericidal effect, it is true, but only within 8 or 24 hours. the following results were obtained from the spray test with agar plate cultures: streptococcus viridans species, streptococci, diplococcus pneumoniae, escheria coli, and proteus were killed, whereas others survived under the plastic film for up to 9 days. klebsiella and pseudomonas aeruginosa had grown through the film within 7 days. in vivo experiments demonstrated a very potent antibacterial activity on the skin under the spray film.
[in-vitro antimicrobial activity of 2 aminoglycoside antibiotics: tobramycin and  gentamycin].
it has been determined the in vitro antibacterial activity of two antibiotics on  409 bacterial stocks isolated from several pathologic materials and composed by e.coli,propeus,salmonellae,pseudomonas,staphylococcus aureus. the tobramicin has shown to have activity against all stocks of e.coli(82),pseudomonas aeruginosa (62) and salmonellae (21) and to have a better activity in comparison with gentamicin also against proteus and staphylococcus aureus.
hr 756, a new cephalosporin active against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
the in vitro activity of hr 756, 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-(z)-(methoximino)acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, was investigated against 659 isolates. hr 756 inhibited neisseria and haemophilus species at concentrations similar to those needed with ampicillin. it inhibited beta-lactamase-producing n. gonorrhoeae and h. influenzae. hr 756 was the most active compound tested against members of the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella, enterobacter, and shigella at concentrations of less than 0.1 mug/ml. it was twice as active as carbenicillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibited bacteroides fragilis as well as cefoxitin. hr 756 killed e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, and p. aeruginosa at rates similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
a prospective controlled investigation of prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in hospitalized granulocytopenic patients.
oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smz) therapy was investigated in the prophylaxis of infections in granulocytopenia. hospitalized granulocytopenic patients were allocated at random to receive tmp/smz (group 1) or to a control group (group 2). the percentage of febrile granulocytopenic days was significantly reduced in group 1, 19 per cent compared to 39 per cent in group 2 (p less than 0.01). in group 1, there were no bacteremias in 59 episodes of granulocytopenia (909 days). in group 2, there were nine bacteremias in 52 episodes of granulocytopenia (796 days)(p = 0.001). disseminated candidiasis developed in two patients in each group. candida occurred in similar numbers in surveillance cultures in both groups; staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were slightly decreased, and enterobacteriaceae resistant to tmp slightly increased in group 1. this study suggest that oral prophylactic tmp/smz therapy is an effective, well tolerated, easily administered alternative to "gut sterilization" with nonabsorbable antibiotics.
piperacillin (t-1220), a new semisynthetic penicillin. ii. in vitro antimicrobial activity and synergy comparison with carbenicillin and gentamicin.
piperacillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin, was found to have potent antimicrobial activity against nearly all (405) tested bacterial species. piperacillin was consistently 4 approximately 16-fold more active than carbenicillin against the enterobacteriaceae, 16 approximately 32-fold against pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas species, and 16-fold against streptococcus faecalis. carbenicillin and piperacillin were equally effective against staphylococcus aureus, but inactivated by beta-lactamase. a 38% overall synergy rate for the piperacillin-gentamicin combination was identified, a finding similar to that for carbenicillin-gentamicin. highest incidences of synergy were found for both antibiotic pairs tested on gentamicin-resistant isolates (ps. aeruginosa and providencia). in vitro findings suggest that piperacillin alone or in combination with aminoglycosides may be highly efficacious in the treatment of most serious bacterial infections.
antibacterial active components in human urine after administration of penicillins.
four-hourly urine from volunteers and patients who had received penicillins orally or intravenously was investigated by means of thin layer chromatography and bioautography. antibacterially active metabolites were not detected with only two of 12 penicillins, namely amoxicillin and mezlocillin. in the case of the other penicillins the metabolites possessed variable antibacterial activity as could be demonstrated using different test microorganisms. after administration of carbenicillin esters three antibacterially active spots were detected, one of which corresponded to penicillin g; the other two were active against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the bioautogram after treatment with azlocillin showed two components which were active against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli; only the rapid moving component was active against p. aeruginosa, however. the formation and chemical nature of these additional active components is still to a large extent not understood. it is quite possible, however, that they affect the bio-availability of an antibiotic.
in vitro investigations with fosfomycin on mueller-hinton agar with and without glucose-6-phosphate.
determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration of fosfomycin in the agar dilution test on mueller-hinton agar showed that the addition of glucose-6-phosphate to the nutrient medium potentiates the action of fosfomycin against escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter and staphylococcus aureus, sometimes by as much as 256-fold. such a potentiation of action was not detectable with serratia marcescens, the individual proteus species, pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococci. fosfomycin is very effective against most medically important bacterial species on mueller-hinton agar containing 25 micrograms/ml glucose-6-phosphate. over 90% of the cultures of e. coli, citrobacter, enterobacter, s. marcescens,proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and enterococci examined were inhibited by less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml fosfomycin.
serotypes and antibiotic susceptibilities of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from single sputa of cystic fibrosis patients.
a phenotypic characterization of pseudomonas aeruginosa from single sputum samples of 21 typical cystic fibrosis patients indicated a high frequency of heterogeneity among isolates on the basis of differences in antibiotic resistance, colony morphology, pigmentation, and serotype. two or more isolates with different but stable susceptibilities to carbenicillin, gentamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim were detected in 38% of the sputa. differences generally were independent of the mucoid state of the strain. o-antigen group determination with the difco typing set showed that two or more serologically distinct strains were present in 10/21 sputum specimens. nonmucoid derivatives of mucoid isolates almost always retained both the antibiotic susceptibilities and serotype of their parent strain. these data suggest that cystic fibrosis patients may be cocolonized/coinfected by different strains of p. aeruginosa more frequently than generally believed. alternatively, phenotypically distinct strains from a single patient might arise as phenotypic dissociants from a single infecting strain. because of the frequency and multiplicity of phenotypically distinct p. aeruginosa isolates which we obtained from our cystic fibrosis patients, it is important to select multiple isolates from sputum cultures for antimicrobial susceptibility testing so as to assess adequately the susceptibility of this organism to antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis. we recommend that several colonies of each distinguishable colony type of p. aeruginosa be pooled for the antibiogram.
clavulanic acid, a novel inhibitor of beta-lactamases.
clavulanic acid, z-(2r,5r)-3-(beta-hydroxyethylidene)-7-oxo-4-oxa-1-azabicyclo-[3,2,0] heptane-2-carboxylic acid, has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of the beta-lactamases of the richmond types ii, iii, iv, and v. inhibition is a time-dependent reaction and is irreversible. clavulanic acid had poor antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, with minimal inhibitory levels greater than 25 mug/ml. it did inhibit the majority of neisseria gonorrhoeae at 0.1 mug/ml and haemophilus influenzae at 6.3 mug/ml. clavulanic acid acted synergistically with penicillins and cephalosporins to inhibit beta-lactamase-producing s. aureus and enterobacteriaceae. clavulanic acid combined with ampicillin inhibited beta-lactamase-producing n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, and shigella sonnei.
in vitro activity of hr 756, a new cephalosporin compound.
the in vitro activity of hr 756, a new cephalosporin, has been determined against recent clinical isolates and compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the geometric means of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) for different isolates of escherichia coli (100 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (84), pseudomonas aeruginosa (121), proteus mirabilis (52), indole-positive proteus species (9), salmonella species (19), staphylococcus aureus penicillin-sensitive (29) and penicillin-resistant (39) were: 0.095, 0.124, 11.1, 0.095, 0.0107, 0.078, 1 and 0.95 mcg/ml, respectively. its activity was affected by rise in inoculum against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa but not against k. pneumoniae and e. coli. bactericidal activity was determined by membrane filtration method. hr 756 was found to be bactericidal to e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and proteus species. although the mics of the tested s. aureus strains were 1 mcg/ml, 5 mcg/ml of hr 756 failed to kill 99% of the inoculum within 24 hours.
comparison of the in vitro activity of bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new antipseudomonal broad-spectrum penicillins, with other beta-lactam drugs.
bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new substituted ampicillins, were compared with  other beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbenicillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and cefoxitin, against a wide range of gram-positive and -negative organisms. bay k 4999 and piperacillin were extremely active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml), being about 16-fold more active than carbenicillin. bay k 4999 was the most active drug against escherichia coli (50% inhibited by 0.5 mug/ml) and klebsiella spp. (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml). piperacillin and bay k 4999 were equally active against proteus spp., and piperacillin had high activity against bacteroides fragilis (50% inhibited by between 1 and 2 mug/ml).
comparison of silver sulfadiazine and gentamicin for topical prophylaxis against  burn wound sepsis.
daily prophylactic application of either 1.0% silver sulfadiazine cream or 0.1% gentamicin cream was compared for effectiveness in preventing bacterial colonization of burn wounds and sepsis. pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized the wounds of 37% of the 38 patients treated with silver sulfadiazine and 30% of the 33 patients treated with gentamicin; gentamicin-resistant p. aeruginosa colonized the wounds of 21% of the patients treated with gentamicin. staphylococcus aureus colonization occurred in 55% of the patients treated with silver sulfadiazine, whereas colonization with candida species occurred in 58% of the patients treated with gentamicin. although gentamicin-resistant organisms caused no deaths their repeated appearance resulted in discontinuation of prophylaxiz with gentamicin cream. the next year p. aeruginosa strains resistant to gentamicin were isolated from burn wounds of only two patients who had not previously received parenteral therapy with gentamicin or tobramycin. gentamicin cream should be reserved for treating patients with wounds infected by gentamicin-sensitive p. aeruginosa and those allergic to sulfa drugs. for most patients with burn wounds silver sulfadiazine is safe and effective as an antibacterial agent for topical prophylaxis.
in vitro activity of 5-episisomicin in bacteria resistant to other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
eighty-seven isolates of pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae, and staphylococcus, chosen because of their resistance to other aminoglycosides, were tested for susceptibility to 5-episisomicin. tests were performed in mueller-hinton agar and also, with 38 of these isolates, in mueller-hinton broth. of enterobacteriaceae, 85 and 95.5% were inhibited by 5 and 10 mug of 5-episisomicin per ml, respectively. amikacin inhibited 74 and 91% of the strains at 10 and 20 mug/ml, respectively. fifty-four percent of p. aeruginosa were inhibited by 5-episisomicin and amikacin. eighty-three percent of s. aureus were inhibited by netilmicin and amikacin, whereas only 50% were inhibited by 5-episisomicin. isolates resistant to 5-episisomicin were most often resistant to the other aminoglycosides and occurred in gram-negative bacilli that did not carry aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. five of 23 isolates that carried a 6'-n-acetyltransferase (aac-6') and one of two that carried an aminoglycoside 3-acetyltransferase were resistant to and acetylate 5-episisomicin. strains carrying other aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes were inhibited by 5-episisomicin. thus, 5-episisomicin is a promising aminoglycoside not attacked by most aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. resistance will probably most often be based upon nonenzymatic mechanisms which will also affect other aminoglycosides.
activity of 5-episisomicin compared with that of other aminoglycosides.
5-episisomicin, a semisynthetic aminoglycoside, has been shown to inhibit many members of the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. at a concentration of 3.1 mug/ml, more than 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, citrobacter, indole-positive proteus, and providencia were inhibited. 5-episisomicin had activity against s. aureus, e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, and citrobacter similar to gentamicin and netilmicin. it had activity similar to amikacin and netilmicin against many gentamicin-resistant bacteria. the activity of 5-episisomicin was greatest at an alkaline ph and in medium of low magnesium content. synergy of 5-episisomicin and carbenicillin was found to occur most often against pseudomonas.
[diminution of the antibacterial activity of antibiotics in cultures and in experimental mixed infections].
we have studied interactions between staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the absence and the presence of four different antimicrobials in mixed cultures and experimental infections. these two bacterial species, in addition to having different properties, are known to be opportunistic pathogens often present in human microflora. two main aspects have been investigated and they are related to modifications in two species affecting their equilibrium in the mixed bacterial population and also their pathogenicity markers. our results indicate that individual growth of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa is not modified in vitro in mixed cultures in the absence of antimicrobials; in vivo, in mouse peritoneal cavity, there is a synergism favorable to s. aureus. in the presence of rifamycin sv and three cell wall inhibitors, pencillin g,d-cycloserine, and vancomycin, we have observed that p. aeruginosa protected s. aureus against the inhibitory effect of these antimicrobials in vitro and in vivo. such results were obtained in different conditions of culture, stationary, shaken, and in special apparatuses, an "ecologen" and a "chemostat." when any one of the antimicrobials was allowed to be in contact for 6 to 8 h with p. aeruginosa cells in a culture, we observed a decrease in their inhibitory effects against s. aureus. these results were supported by microscopical observation. it seems that the inhibitory effects of the antimicrobials have hindered the formation of toxic products of s. aureus, e.g., alpha toxin, and that it was not restored in the presence of p. aeruginosa. conversely, p. aeruginosa remained apparently unchanged through all these experiments. our observations may imply that the inhibitory effect of an antimicrobial towards a bacterial species may be significantly decreased in the presence of another species, sometimes present in human microflora.
sce-129, antipseudomonal cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
sce-129 [3-(4-carbamoyl-1-pyridiniomethyl)-7beta-(d-alpha-sulfophenylacetamido)-ceph-3-em -4-carboxylate monosodium salt], a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, shows potent in vitro antibacterial activities against pseudomonas aeruginosa and some gram-positive bacteria, whereas it shows lower activity against many gram-negative rods. against clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa this cephalosporin exhibited higher activity than did carbenicillin, and against the strains of staphylococcus aureus, sce-129 had similar activity to carbenicillin. variations in ph, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had no significant effects on the activity of the cephalosporin; however, the inoculum size had some effect on the activity. sce-129 is an effective bactericidal agent against p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. the protective effects of sce-129 in mice infected with p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were more potent than those of carbenicillin. the protective effects of sce-129 on pseudomonas infection in mice varied according to the dosage schedule and the challenge dose. in a multiple dose schedule, a smaller amount of sce-129 was necessary than that in a single dose schedule. the effects of sce-129 after subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration were more potent than were those by intravenous administration. no protective effect was observed by oral administration.
[resistance of pyogenic bacteria during a period of five years (author's transl)].
the bacteriological results of 4113 clinical specimens (wound-swabs) were analysed. in 40 per cent of positive findings staphylococcus aureus was isolated, furthermore, in decreasing frequency staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci and haemolysing streptococci. during this study a considerable quota of the examined strains was observed to show large fluctuation in sensitivity, but more than half of the isolates demonstrated increasing resistance against the chemotherapeutics tested. in order to reduce the development of resistance, our results ascertain the necessity for a scientific antibacterial therapy as well as the strict observance of hospital hygienic measures.
possible beta-lactamase activities detectable in infective clinical specimens.
biological beta-lactam antibiotic-inactivating activities were detected in bacteriuria and suppurating pleural fluids. clinical specimens were sterilized with membrane filters and the amounts of ampicillin and/or cephalothin which were being inactivated by 1 ml of each filtrate were determined. in general, filtrates which originally yielded klebsiella sp. tended to show activity against ampicillin; whereas those yielding enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed activity against cephalothin.
ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against klebsiella pneumoniae (p less than .001), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than .001) and aeromonas hydrophilia (p less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for staphylococcus aureus (p less than .001), streptococcus agalactiae (p less than .001), staphylococcus epidermidis (p less than .001) and streptococcus viridans (p less than .005). significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli.
antibacterial sensitivity patterns of bacteria isolated from dogs with otitis externa.
from january, 1973, to december, 1975, the most prevalent microorganisms isolated from ear swab specimens taken from 323 dogs with otitis externa were staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus spp. comparison of the antibiograms of these isolants to those reported from england in 1961 and from the united states in 1970 suggested emergence of a greater proportion of bacterial strains with resistance to antibacterial agents commonly used to treat otitis externa of dogs.
effects of membrane-energy mutations and cations on streptomycin and gentamicin accumulation by bacteria: a model for entry of streptomycin and gentamicin in susceptible and resistant bacteria.
several mutants of escherichia coli affecting aerobic energy generation and energization of the bacterial membrane have been examined for their effect on streptomycin and gentamicin accumulation and susceptibility. a heme-deficient mutant (k207) and two mutants (cj-8 [colicin k insensitive] and nr-70) associated with defective aerobic active transport were associated with decreased transport of streptomycin and gentamicin and increased resistance to those antibiotics. these mutants also exhibited increased resistance to several other aminoglycoside antibiotics, but not the aminocyclitol spectinomycin. the same observations were made with a ubiquinone-deficient mutant, but a stra derivative of this mutant was shown additionally to be saturable for streptomycin accumulation at a concentration four or more times lower than that required for saturation of the parent. a mutant uncoupled for adenosine 5'-triphosphate synthesis from electron transport and membrane mg-adenosine 5'-triphosphatase deficient was hypersensitive to those aminoglycosides tested and spectinomycin, and showed enhanced transport of streptomycin and gentamicin. a variety of compounds structurally related to streptomycin were examined at high concentrations for inhibition of streptomycin uptake in a stra mutant of e. coli k-12 sa 1306, but no evidence for competition was detected, suggesting the absence of a common transport carrier. four different divalent cations were shown to inhibit streptomycin and gentamicin accumulation in e. coli k-12 sa 1306. divalent cations were shown to inhibit uptake of these two drugs in two bacterial species with distinct cell wall structures, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and to inhibit streptomycin uptake in spheroplasts of streptomycin-susceptible and -resistant e. coli. however, calcium had almost no inhibitory effect on streptomycin uptake by the ubiquinone-deficient mutant e. coli an66. these and previous findings have been used to formulate a model for aminoglycoside entry into bacteria using a low-affinity membranous complex involved in membrane energization that includes respiratory quinones, which probably act to bind and transport aminoglycosides across the cell membrane. this phase of transport is associated with the lowest accumulation rate (termed energy-dependent phase i) that is rate limiting for susceptibility. it is further proposed that subsequent association of the membrane-bound aminoglycoside with higher-affinity binding sites on membrane-associated ribosomes carrying out a normal ribosomal cycle and protein synthesis results in a more rapid transport rate (termed energy-dependent phase ii). the increased rate could result from a state of membrane energization analogous to that causing enhanced aminoglycoside transport rates seen in the uncoupled mutant, an120. how this model explains the mechanism by which enzymatically modified aminoglycosides render cells resistant to unmodified aminoglycosides is also discussed.
clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from streptomyces clavuligerus.
a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from streptomyces clavuligerus atcc 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. this compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. the cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae p99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. coli are less well inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, k. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and e. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.
azlocillin: in vitro studies of a new semisynthetic penicillin.
the activity of azlocillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin, was determined against 582 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. over 75% of the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at a concentration of 12.5 mug or less per ml. azlocillin is also active against indole-negative and -positive proteus spp., inhibiting 98 and 71%, respectively, at a concentration of 12.5 mug or less per ml. isolates of klebsiella spp. and enterobacter spp. showed less susceptibility than isolates of escherichia coli and serratia spp. gram-positive cocci except penicillin g-resistant staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to azlocillin. azlocillin failed to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacilli when large inocula were used. it was more active in alkaline ph, but the type of medium used had little effect on its activity. azlocillin was more active than mezlocillin, ticarcillin, and carbenicillin and as active as blp-1654 against isolates of p. aeruginosa. it was not as active as mezlocillin against the majority of the other gram-negative bacilli.
mode of action of the protein, sp127, which enhances the activity of macrolide antibiotics against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
antibiotics, the activity of which enhanced against pseudomonas aeruginosa by sp127, were restricted to the basic macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, maridomycin and oleandomycin, the neutral macrolide antibiotics such as lankamycin and lankacidin c, vancomycin and enramycin. synergistic activity of sp127 with the above antibiotics was found against pseudomonas aeruginosa and several strains of escherichia coli, but not against proteus vulgaris and macrolide-resistant staphylococcus aureus. sp127 had extremely weak proteolytic but no lytic activity. from the isotopic experiments, the action of sp127 was partially attributed to the promotion of antibiotic penetration to cells of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
mezlocillin: in vitro studies of a new broad-spectrum penicillin.
mezlocillin is a new semisynthetic penicillin that inhibited 71% of the isolates  of serratia marcescens, 67% of escherichia coli, 50% of enterobacter spp., and 49% of klebsiella spp. at a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml. it is also active against both indole-positive and -negative proteus spp. and gram-positive cocci, except penicillin g-resistant staphylococcus aureus. at a concentration of 100 mug/ml, it inhibited 94% of the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. it is more active than ampicillin, carbenicillin, and cephalothin against some gram-negative bacilli.
synthesis and biological activity of some new furan quaternary salts.
a series of new n-(5-substituted 2-furfuryl)-n,n-dimethyl-n-aryloxyalkyl quaternary ammonium salts relating to general structure iv has been synthesized by reacting 5-substituted 2-(n,n-dimethylaminomethyl)furans iia-d with appropriate aryloxyalkyl bromides iii. the resulting compounds are tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity. a simpler synthesis of 5-nitro-2-(n,n-dimethylaminomethyl)furan (iid) involving the reduction of n,n-dimethyl-5-nitro-2-furamide (ib) with diborane is described. a new compound, 5-bromo-2-(n,n-dimethylaminomethyl)furnan (iic), is prepared in a similar way. many of these compounds (22, 28, 34, 37-42, 44, and 45) indicate high activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and are more active than nitrofurantoin, compounds 22, 34 and 41 exhibit the highest in vitro antibacterial activity in the series. some of these quaternary salts (22, 25, 37, 37-41, and 60) possess appreciable activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv. none of these compounds show significant antifungal activity. eight compounds (18, 21, 22, 26-28, 32, and 34) have high in vitro antibacterial activity were inactive when tested for anthelmintic activity in rats against nippostrongylus brasiliensis and hymenolepis nana.
in vitro activity of netilmicin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
the in vitro activity of netilmicin (sch 20569), a new semisynthetic derivative of gentamicin, was compared with that of gentamicin and amikacin. one hundred and ninety-two clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were tested using both agar and broth dilution techniques. netilmicin was comparable to gentamicin, with the following exceptions: (i) for serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa, gentamicin was more active than netilmicin; (ii) all strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, and citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to gentamicin, were susceptible to netilmicin; (iii) some strains of s. marcescens, indole-positive proteus, and providencia, which were resistant to gentamicin, were susceptible to netilmicin. netilmicin was more active than amikacin for all enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus and equal to amikacin in activity against gentamicin-susceptible strains of p. aeruginosa. all strains of p. aeruginosa, resistant to gentamicin, were also resistant to netilmicin but were susceptible to amikacin. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) obtained with broth and agar showed no significant differences except for p. mirabilis, where broth mics were twofold greater than agar mics, and for p. aeruginosa, where agar mics were twofold higher than broth mics. the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) was either identical to or within one twofold dilution of the mic for the strains tested. a 100-fold increase in inoculum size produced less increase in mic and mbc with netilmicin than with gentamicin or amikacin.

mice were protected against a lethal dose of pseudomonas aeruginosa by a previous sublethal infection with staphylococcus aureus. under similar conditions, staphylococcus epidermidis afforded only slight protection. the following characteristics of this increased resistance that we have observed are (1) survival of mice, and decrease of the number of viable units of p. aeruginosa in the peritoneal cavity of the same mice infected with s. aureus coagulase-positive strains, either from our laboratory collection or from hospital cases, when the time interval between the injection with staphylococci and that of p. aeruginosa was between 4 and 96 h; (2) absence of a net inhibitory effect in vitro on p. aeruginosa with serum from mice infected with a sublethal dose of coagulase-positive s. aureus; (3) changes in the appearance of peritoneal exudate cells after infection with a sublethal dose of s. aureus; p. aeruginosa injected afterwards in the peritoneal cavity of mice was eliminated; when p. aeruginosa was injected alone, "activated macrophages" were not observed and bacterial cells were present in large numbers in the exudate. the immunostimulation induced by a previous sublethal injection of s. aureus coagulase-positive strains seemed to be inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide, since mice were no longer protected against a lethal dose of p. aeruginosa. cell immunity may intervene in such infections with opportunistic species and check the invasiveness of a gram-negative bacterium superinfecting a host already exposed to coagulase-positive s. aureus.
[the effect of ear surgery to the immunologic defense system of the middle ear during chronic otitis media (author's transl)].
alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-2-macroglobuline are very important proteinase inhibitors for the healing process in chronic otitis media, because they can inhibit numerous bacterial and leukocytic proteinases: alpha-2-macroglobuline can block the malignant proteinases of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and proteus vulgaris. in 58 cases in the middle ear secretion was examined and the level of alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-2-macroglobulin investigated pre- and postoperatively. by these investigations we could demonstrate that the postoperative level of these two inhibitors is higher than preoperatively. in a couple of cases with cholesteatoma the postoperative concentration of alpha-2-macroglobuline was nearly three times higher than prior to the tympanoplasty. we believe that one of the causes for this high inhibitor level is the liberation of alpha-2-macroglobuline by injuring blood vessels during a tympanoplasty. it is our opinion that the increase of the inhibitor level in the postoperative phase is one of the prerequisites for the healing process in chronic otitis media.
in vitro study of netilmicin compared with other aminoglycosides.
netilmicin (sch 20569) is an ethyl derivative of gentamicin c(1a) that is active  against most enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus isolates. among 342 clinical isolates tested, all staphylococci; 92% of escherichia coli, 93% of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 92% of enterobacter were inhibited by 0.8 mug or less of netilmicin per ml, but only 78% of p. aeruginosa were inhibited by 3.1 mug or less per ml. most clinical isolates of enterococci, serratia marcescens, and providencia were not inhibited by 3.1 mug of netilmicin per ml. like other aminoglycosides, the netilmicin in vitro activity was markedly influenced by the growth medium used, with activity decreased by sodium, calcium, and magnesium. netilmicin was more active at alkaline ph. addition of magnesium to pseudomonas or serratia pretreated with netilmicin produced inhibition of killing. netilmicin was more active than gentamicin, sisomicin, tobramycin, or amikacin against e. coli and k. pneumoniae. netilmicin inhibited growth of all gentamicin-resistant isolates of klebsiella and citrobacter tested, but only 73% of e. coli; pseudomonas and providencia were resistant to netilmicin. most serratia (95%) and indole-positive proteus (83%) isolates were resistant to netilmicin but were inhibited by amikacin.
synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of substituted 5,6-dihydro-5-nitrouracils.
reaction of 5-nitrouracil derivatives with sodium borohydride in methanol-water,  followed by neutralization of the product with acid, has produced 5,6-dihydro-5-nitrouracil (5) 5,6-dihydro-6-dihydro-6-methyl-5-nitrouracil (7), 5,6-dihydro-5-nitro-1-(4-nitrophenyl)uracil (10), and 5,6-dihydro-5-nitro-1(beta-d-ribofuranuronic acid ethyl ester)uracil (12). in assays for antimicrobial activity using strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and trichophyton mentagrophytes, significant inhibition of growth was not found.
laboratory findings of tobramycin and their relation to clinical response.
the susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to tobramycin were studied, and the applicability of these data to clinical situations was evaluated. the bactericidal nature of tobramycin was confirmed by killing curves, and the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 500 common pathogens were used to define its spectrum. isolates inhibited by less than or equal to 5 mug/ml were considered to be sensitive to tobramycin. the clinical response of some patients was examined in relation to the minimal inhibitory concentration for the infecting organism and the serum and urine levels of tobramycin. the activity of tobramycin was compared with that of gentamicin against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. tobramycin was at least twice as active as gentamicin against p. aeruginosa. the effectiveness of tobramycin against s. aureus and e. coli was compared with that of other commonly used antibiotics, and its clinical role as an alternative to gentamicin in the "best guess" treatment of septicemia was considered. lincomycin is often added to counter the ineffectiveness of tobramycin against streptococci and anaerobes such as bacteroides species, but this combination was antagonistic against e. coli when tested in vitro by the checkerboard technique and its graphical display, the isobologram. tobramycin was essentially similar to gentamicin in laboratory characteristics and clinical application but was more active against p. aeruginosa in general and against gentamicin-resistant strains in particular.
[further researches on antimicrobial agents involvement in urine bacteriological  analysis (author's transl)].
a further investigation on about 2700 urine samples for testing the presence of antimicrobial drugs (spot-test) has been carried out. bacteriostatic agents were present in 35% of all samples analysed, of these, 47% were urines producing no growth on culturing, 10% had a bacterial count of 10(4) and 43% of 10(5) or more. the frequency of the spot-test positive samples was correlated to the origin from the different hospital departments. gram-positive bacteria were the most represented in the samples without antimicrobial agents, while the frequency of pseudomonas aeruginosa rised in samples with antimicrobial drugs. under both conditions no significant variation in the antibiotic-sensitivity pattern was noted in organisms isolated from the urines. only indole-positive proteus appeared to be more sensitive when isolated from samples containing no antimicrobial agents.
the antibacterial activity of chloroxylenol in combination with ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid.
the bactericidal activity of rba 777 has been found to vary with both the cultural and environmental test conditions against pseudomonas aeruginosa and to a lesser extent against staphylococcus aureus. these variations may explain certain anomalies in earlier work regarding the activity of chloroxylenol-based products. the addition of edta to rba 777 has brought about an improvement in the performance against p. aeruginosa and this activity is confirmed in vivo. previous reports have already illustrated this potential and the evaluations of the new antibacterial agent da 136 confirms and extends these results to its performance under adverse conditions, often associated with the hospital environment.
in vitro studies with sisomicin and gentamicin.
sisomicin and gentamicin were tested in vitro against 222 clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria using the ics agar dilution procedure. the two drugs were comparable in terms of overall activity although statistical analyses of the data revealed significant differences in their activity against several genera. sisomicin was significantly more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.001), proteus mirabilis (p less than 0.005), and escherichia coli (p less than 0.01); gentamicin was significantly more active against klebsiella (p less than 0.001). in most instances, 4.0 mug/ml of either drug was inhibitory for 90% or more of the isolates of each genus tested.
["in vitro" determination of bacterial sensitivity to tobramycin (author's transl)].
the authors report the tobramycin minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 264 strains (dilution in mueller-hinton agar). staphylococcus aureus (96 strains) have a mic of 0.02 mcg/ml, 80 % being inhibited by 0.07 mcg/ml. most enterobacteriaceae (70 strains) are sensitive to 0.7 mcg/ml ; providencia are the most resistant (mic 11.88 mcg/ml). among pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains, mic : 11.57 mcg/ml) 50 % are inhibited by 0.30 mcg/ml, 80 % by 18.8 mcg/ml. relationships of mic to zone diameters with the use of 10 mcg (d 10) and 30 mcg (d 30) tobramycin discs allow to draw the regression line which is respectively : y = -- 0,331 x + 6,64 and y = -- 0.263 x + 7,68. the strains are sensitive with an inhibition diameter greater than or equal to 16 mm (d 10) or greater than or equal to 18.5 mm (d 30).
tobramycin: a review of its antibacterial and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
synopsis: tobramycin is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum in vitro, and pharmacokinetic properties similar to those for gentamicin. tobramycin is more active than gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and active against many gentamicin resistant strains, but is not active against enterobacteriaceae resistant to gentamicin. theoretically, tobramycin has an advantage over gentamicin against infections caused by p. aeruginosa, but any advantage in clinical practice has yet to be adequately demonstrated. clinical experience with tobramycin is considerably less than with gentamicin. whilst tobramycin appears to offer no clear advantages over gentamicin against sensitive organisms it is indicated in infection caused by strains of p. aeruginosa which are resistant to gentamicin, but sensitive to tobramycin. like gentamicin, tobramycin acts synergistically with corbenicillin and the cephalosporins. the efficacy of the tobramycin-carbenicillin combination has been shown in endocarditis caused by p. aeruginosa which was unresponsive to gentamicin plus carbenicillin. ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity similar to that seen with other animoglycosides have been encountered in therapeutic trials with tobramycin and wider clinical experience is necessary to determine the relative incidence of these side-effects with gentamicin and tobramycin used under similar conditions. antimicrobial activity: in comparative studies, in vitro, tobramycin is more active than gentamicin against clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. similarly, the inhibitory index, which is the ratio between the serum concentration attained at usual therapuetic doses and the minimum inhibitory concentration, for pseudomonas aeruginosa is higher for tobramycin than for gentamicin. against gram-negative bacteria other than pseudomonas spp. the spectrum of activity of tobramycin is similar to that of gentamicin. for most species the activity of tobramycin is slightly less than that of gentamicin. gentamicin is consistently more active than tobramycin against serratia marcescens. like other aminoglycoside antibiotics, tobramycin is active in vitro in low concentrations against staphylococcus aureus. tobramycin is essentially inactive against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). maner aminoglycosides and of other antibiotics against various bacteria in vitro, but comparisons between studies cannot always be interpreted literally because the activity of many antibiotics in vitro, including tobramycin, is influenced by the nature of the culture media and the presence of certain salts. the sensitivity of p. aeruginosa to tobramycin is influenced by the magnesium, and calcium content of the culture media whilst that of all species is reduced by sodium ions. wide variations in the concentration of these ions may result in divergent mic values and an inappropriate choice of antibacterial agent to treat pseudomonas infection...
[comparison of the antibacterial activity of amikacin (bb-k8) with other aminoglycosides against pathogens recently isolated from clinical materials (author's transl) ].
we determined the antibacterial activity of amikacin against 1,277 strains of pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical materials during 1974, including beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter, serratia, proteus morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and compared the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of this drug with gentamicin, dibekacin, tobramycin and kanamycin. 1)antibacterial activity of amikacin against beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci was as weak as the other four aminoglycosides, but against staph. aureus, staph. epidermidis, various groups of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed amikacin the good antibacterial activity as gentamicin, dibedacin and tobramycin, and also showed the good activity against kanamycin resistant strains. 2) amikacin has the similar antibacterial spectrum as gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin, but its antibacterial activity is generally weakest among these four drugs. 3) on many strains tested the cross resistance is observed between amikacin and one of gentamicin, dibekacin and tobramycin, but several strains of proteus morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa which have rather large mic against gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin showed rather small mic against amikacin.
the varying sensitivity to antibacterial agents of micro-organisms in pure vs. mixed cultures.
in this study the disc sensitivities of five organisms growing in pure cultures (staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans) were first determined against each of seven antibacterial agents (penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, silver nitrate, sulfamylon, and betadine). then the sensitivity of each organism growing in combination with one of the others (10 combinations) was tested against each of the same antibacterials. significantly increased and decreased sensitivities were found in 30 percent of the cultures with decreases largely predominating. total obliteration of all sensitivity occurred 10 percent of the time. the changes in sensitivity were not distributed randomly but rather were associated more with particular agents and organisms. sulfamylon, was associated with decreases 70 percent of the time with sensitivity obliteration in 50 percent of the tests. streptococcus led all the organisms, being associated with decreases in half of the tests. it is possible that mixed-culture sensitivities could provide the most valid information when mixed infections exist, since they more closely simulate the real clinical situation. therefore it is suggested that both mixed and pure culture sensitivity testing be done for all mixed infections.
in vitro determination of the antimicrobial properties of two cyanoacrylate preparations.
isobutyl and trifluoro cyanoacrylates showed varying degrees of inhibition for lactobacillus casei and staphylococcus aureus when tested by the spread plate technique. candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. the results tend to support the view that inhibition of growth was due to the vapor effect and not the diffusibility of the cyanoacrylates.
correlation of human in vivo and in vitro cutaneous antimicrobial factors.
the presence of antimicrobial substances on human skin was investigated. staphyloccus aureus (10-4 colony-forming units) was applied on the forearm of 50 subjects and covered with a semiocclusive device for 24 hr. in 54% of the subjects the organisms persisted, and in 34% s. aureus was inhibited on the skin. subjects with persistent s. aureus also had persistent candida albicans, and vice persa. this correlation was not noted with streptococcus pyogenes. skin lipids from the two groups of subjects were extracted with acetone and assayed against s. aureus, s. pyogenes, and c. albicans. the percentage of s. aureus or c. albicans recovered was higher (79% and 55%, respectively) in subjects with persistent microrgamisms on their skin than in those without (47% and 28%, respectively). subjects with persistent s. aureus and c. albicans had higher counts of normal flora (average, 9.2 times 10-3) than those on whose skin these organisms did not persist (average, 7.4 times 10-2). coagulase-negative staphylococcus and micrococcus were found in higher proportions in subjects with persistent test organisms than in those without. subjects with lower counts of their normal flora had a higher proportion of diphtheroids (34%) than the high-count group (12%).
in vitro studies with cefazolin.
susceptibilities of 259 isolates of pathogenic bacteria to cefazolin were measured by broth and agar dilution procedures. beta-hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 0.25 mug/ml, whereas staphylococcus aureus and alphahemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 2.0 mug/ml. enterococci were resistant to less than 32 mug/ml. wide variation was seen with gram-negative species. most isolates of klebsiella species and proteus mirabilis were inhibited by 4.0 or 8.0 mug/ml. escherichia coli were less susceptible, and most isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia species, and enterobacter species were resistant to 128 mug/ml.
reversal by pseudomonas aeruginosa of rifamycin sv inhibition of staphylococcus aureus in vitro and in vivo.

interaction of clindamycin and gentamicin in vitro.
the minimal inhibitory concentrations of clindamycin and gentamicin alone and in  combinations were determined by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic clinical isolates. all 77 strains of staphylococcus aureus, diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and anaerobic bacteria (except for three strains of clostridium) were inhibited by 1.6 mug or less of clindamycin per ml. gentamicin did not interfere with the activity of clindamycin within the range of concentrations tested (0.1 to 100 mug/ml); for some strains combinations were synergistic. sixty-two (94%) of 66 strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 6.2 mug or less of gentamicin per ml. combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 29 strains and synergistic for 33 strains. all 20 strains of enterococcus, three strains of clostridium, three strains of escherichia coli, and one strain of proteus rettgeri were resistant to both clindamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml) and gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml). combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains. except for clindamycin-sensitive isolates, synergy was usually observed only at concentrations of one or both drugs which are not readily obtainable in vivo. antagonism was never observed.
minimal inhibitory concentrations of twenty antimicrobial agents to animal pathogens.
minimal inhibitory concentration (m.i.c.) values as determined by an agar-plate-dilution method for 60 bacterial isolates, consisting of salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus of animal origin against 20 antimicrobial drugs are presented. of all the drugs, gentamicin had the best in vitro antibacterial activity in terms of m.i.c. when considering all the species of organisms together, while spectinomycin had the least activity.an inoculum replicator was a convenient tool in carrying out the agar-plate-dilution method.a comparison of the m.i.c. values of 42 isolates of s. typhimurium with the results obtained by low level method and the bauer-kir-by method showed that with few exceptions, there is a general agreement.
two new inhibitory activities in blood of mice with delayed hypersensitivity, after challenge with specific antigen.
in addition to the activities associated with migration inhibitory factor and type ii interferon, two other inhibitory activities have been found in the sera of mice infected intravenously with bcg and 3 weeks later challenged intravenously with old tuberculin. growth of three bacteria, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one yeast, candida albicans, was inhibited in vitro by a factor or factors in the serum. also, hematopoiesis of mouse bone marrow cells in a soft agar medium was suppressed by the serum.
anti-gamma globulins and chronic infection: comparative studies of the immune response to various bacteria and gamma globulin preparations.
a study of the relationship of clinical states associated with prolonged infection (bacterial endocarditis and osteomyelitis) and generation of serum anti-gamma globulins was made with particular reference to quantitative amounts of staphylococcal protein a in various infecting strains. no correlation between individual strain amounts of protein a and presence of anti-gamma globulins was detected. thirty-eight rabbits were immunized intravenously with various strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, streptomyces viridans, pneumococci, pseudomonas, and escherichia coli) for periods of 6 weeks, and antibacterial as well as anti-gamma globulin antibodies were assayed. no single group or strain of bacteria stood out as being more prone to produce anti-gamma globulins than others tested. most rabbits developed anti-gamma globulins reacting with human gamma globulins, whereas the specificity for rabbit gamma globulin appeared more restricted. in 16 rabbits immunized with eight different strains of s. aureus, quantitative elevation of serum gamma globulin above 2.5 g per 100 ml often seemed to be correlated with presence of detectable serum anti-gamma globulins. by contrast 15 rabbits immunized with autologous or isologous rabbit gamma globulins in many instances developed extremely high titers of anti-gamma globulins showing primary specificity for human rather than rabbit gamma globulin. these studies further amplify the remarkably heterogeneous anti-gamma globulin reactivity associated with various types of immune response.
in vitro evaluation of tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic.
one hundred fifty-two strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella-enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 mug of tobramycin/ml in a broth-dilution method and showed zones of inhibition of 16 mm or more around a 10-mug tobramycin disc in the kirby-bauer method. tobramycin was most active against s. aureus, 100% of strains being inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. all strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and indole-positive proteus species, and 80% of enterobacter species were inhibited by 0.8 mug of tobramycin/ml, whereas only 48% of p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by this concentration. tobramycin was approximately twice as active as gentamicin against s. aureus, four times as active against p. aeruginosa, slightly more active against e. coli and enterobacter species, equally active against p. mirabilis, and slightly less active against k. pneumoniae. the minimal bactericidal concentrations of tobramycin and gentamicin were the same as or twice the minimal inhibitory concentrations for all strains except those of p. aeruginosa, against which greater concentrations of both gentamicin and tobramycin were required for bactericidal activity. tobramycin sterilized cultures of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa, but the rate of bactericidal action was faster with a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin than with either antibiotic alone in the same concentrations. tobramycin retained potency in the presence of 200 to 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml for at least 6 hr of incubation at 37 c, but lost potency in the presence of 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml by 24 hr of incubation and in the presence of 800 mug/ml by 2 hr of incubation.
evaluation of a new cephalosporin antibiotic, cephapirin.
cephapirin sodium, a parenterally administered derivative of cephalosporanic acid, was tested in vitro against 150 stock cultures of enterobacteriaceae and 30 stock cultures each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. both broth- and agar-dilution techniques were employed with two sizes of inocula of organisms. at a concentration of 7.5 mug or less/ml, cephapirin inhibited and killed 100% of strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis and more than 80% of klebsiella species when tested against an inoculum of 10(5) bacterial cells/ml. however, even at 100 mug/ml, only a few isolates of other enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas were inhibited. a 100-fold increase in the inoculum resulted in decreased susceptibility of organisms. all penicillin-susceptible as well as penicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates were inhibited and killed by 5 mug or less of cephapirin/ml when tested with an inoculum of either 10(4) or 10(6) organisms/ml. the drug also was studied in various doses in the treatment of 77 patients with diverse infections. cephapirin was effective in the treatment of 27 of 32 patients with pulmonary infection, as well as in 6 of 7 patients with staphylococcal or streptococcal soft tissue infection. of 25 patients with urinary-tract infections, 19 developed a negative culture during therapy. a single 4-g intramuscular dose of cephapirin was effective in only 2 of 11 patients with gonococcal urethritis or endocervicitis. two patients with gonococcal urethritis treated with multiple injections were cured. the drug was well tolerated except for pain at the site of injection in 14 patients and phlebitis in 4 patients. no abnormalities in renal or hepatic function could be attributed to cephapirin. in addition, no abnormalities were found in the renal tubules of rabbits challenged with 500 mg of cephapirin/kg. if further studies document that cephapirin is well tolerated by the parenteral route, it may have advantages over cephalothin or cephaloridine.
evaluation of the in vitro activity of tobramycin as compared with that of gentamicin sulfate.
the in vitro activity of tobramycin was quantitatively compared with that of gentamicin sulfate against 195 bacterial isolates from clinical material. tobramycin was found to be twice as active as gentamicin against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. conversely, gentamicin proved fourfold more active than tobramycin against isolates of serratia marcescens. both drugs were of comparable activity against isolates of staphylococcus aureus and the majority of the enterobacterial isolates other than s. marcescens. on the basis of the obtained data, the following criteria are proposed for the interpretation of diffusion susceptibility tests with 10-mug discs of gentamicin and tobramycin. enterobacteriaceae and isolates of s. aureus are designated as susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin if the zones of inhibition measure 15 mm or more in diameter; zones of 14 mm or less are indicative of resistance. pseudomonadaceae are interpreted as sensitive to tobramycin and gentamicin if the inhibition zones measure at least 15 and 12 mm in diameter, respectively.
in vitro activity of coumermycin a1.
the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) was compared with that of novobiocin, ampicillin, and minocycline. coumermycin was found to be the most active antibiotic of the four against staphylococcus aureus. it was about 50 times more active than novobiocin or minocycline against the strains tested. coumermycin also showed good activity against group a streptococci and pneumococci, moderate activity against escherichia coli, indole-positive proteus species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against klebsiella-enterobacter and enterococci. against p. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. the new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.
broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of a new triazenoimidazole.
methyl-5(or 4)-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)-imidazole-4(or 5)-carboxylate was shown  to have in vitro antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, filamentous fungi, and algae. preliminary studies with mice, experimentally infected with staphylococcus aureus, have shown that this new antimicrobial agent has in vivo chemotherapeutic activity comparable to that observed with penicillin.
