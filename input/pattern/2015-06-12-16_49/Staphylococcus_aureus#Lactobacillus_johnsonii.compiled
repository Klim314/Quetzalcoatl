TI  - Screening of Lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. Recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. A study was conducted to evaluate probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or cloacae of domestic geese. Among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16S-23S regions of rDNA, dominated Lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by Lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and Lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). All lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, and Riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. In the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to Lactobacillus was observed in R. anatipestifer and P. multocida, and the lowest in E. coli and S. aureus. The ability to produce H(2)O(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus sp. All lactobacilli showed resistance to pH 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. The data demonstrate that Lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. The antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. The selected Lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and were also resistant to low pH and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Peptidoglycan from lactobacilli inhibits interleukin-12 production by macrophages induced by Lactobacillus casei through Toll-like receptor 2-dependent and independent mechanisms.
AB  - We previously showed that Lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion can stimulate macrophages to induce large a quantity of interleukin-12 (IL-12). In this study, we examined the influence of lactobacilli and bacterial cell wall components on IL-12 production by macrophages that was induced by Lactobacillus casei, which has a rigid cell wall. Easily digestible lactobacilli such as Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus plantarum or their intact cell walls (ICWs) weakly or very weakly induced IL-12 production by macrophages, and inhibitedL. casei-induced IL-12 production. While the ICW of L. casei was resistant to intracellular digestion and did not inhibit L. casei-induced IL-12 production, its polysaccharide-depleted ICW, i.e. intact peptidoglycan, was sensitive to intracellular digestion and inhibited L. casei-induced IL-12 production. Furthermore, the peptidoglycans of L. johnsonii, L. plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus also inhibited L. casei-induced IL-12 production. Peptidoglycans from lactobacilli suppressed L. casei-induced expression of IL-12p40 but not IL-12p35 mRNA. Inhibition of IL-12 production by peptidoglycan was mitigated in Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-deficient macrophages compared with the inhibition in wild-type macrophages. A derivative of the minimal structural unit of peptidoglycan (6-O-stearoyl-muramyl dipeptide) recognized by nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) could also suppress L. casei-induced IL-12 production. These findings demonstrate that easily digestible bacteria and peptidoglycan suppress IL-12 production through pattern recognition receptors such as TLR2 and NOD2. IL-12 production in the gut may be negatively regulated by the simultaneous inhibitory actions of various resident bacteria that are susceptible to intracellular digestion.
TI  - Characterization of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  - Lactobacillus spp., referred to as IJ-1 and IJ-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. According to the analyses of 16S rDNA sequence, Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 showed greater than 99% homology with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016(T), and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 had greater than 99% homology with the L. gasseri ATCC 33323(T) and L. johnsonii ATCC 33200(T). The pH changes in the culture media of Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. Their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. Neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. Both strains inhibited the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Salmonella enterica KCTC 12401, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Staphylococcus aureus KCTC 3881, and Bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.
TI  - spr1630 is responsible for the lethality of clpX mutations in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The Clp protease ATPase subunit and chaperone ClpX is dispensable in some bacteria, but it is thought to be essential in others, including streptococci and lactococci. We confirm that clpX is essential in the Rx strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae but show that the requirement for clpX can be relieved by point mutations, frame shifts, or deletion of the gene spr1630, which is found in many isolates of S. pneumoniae. Homologs occur frequently in Staphylococcus aureus as well as in a few strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. In each case, the spr1630 homolog is accompanied by a putative transcriptional regulator with an HTH DNA binding motif. In S. pneumoniae, the spr1630-spr1629 gene pair, accompanied by a RUP element, occurs as an island inserted between the trpA and cclA genes in 15 of 22 sequenced genomes.
TI  - Enolases from Gram-positive bacterial pathogens and commensal lactobacilli share  functional similarity in virulence-associated traits.
AB  - Enolase occurs as a cytoplasmic and a surface-associated protein in bacteria. Enolases of the bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as of the commensal lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus johnsonii, were purified as His(6)-fusion proteins from recombinant Escherichia coli. The fusion proteins were compared for putative virulence-associated functions, i.e., binding of human plasminogen, enhancement of plasminogen activation by human plasminogen activators, as well as binding to immobilized laminin, fibronectin and collagens. The individual enolases showed varying efficiencies in these functions. In particular, highly and equally effective interactions with plasminogen and laminin were seen with lactobacillar and staphylococcal enolases.
TI  - Adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Five Lactobacillus plantarum strains and two Lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from African traditionally fermented milk products or children's feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. The relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to HT29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the L. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to HT29 cells. Four L. plantarum and two L. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to HT29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. The two L. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the intestinal pathogens Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028. The L. plantarum BFE 1685 and L. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with HT29 cells in a strain-dependent way. These two potential probiotic strains also significantly increased interleukin-8 (IL-8) chemokine production by HT29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), did not occur. Altogether, our results suggested that L. plantarum BFE 1685 and L. johnsonii BFE 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.
TI  - Identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - Screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kDa protein. Analysis of the 3010-bp DNA insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encodes LysA, a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages Lj928 and Lj965 from Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lp1 and Lp2 from Lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage Phiadh. The immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated ORF downstream of lysA which has similarity to glutamyl-tRNA synthetases. The N-terminus of LysA has sequence similarity with N-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the C-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial SH3b domains. C-terminal bacterial SH3b domains were identified in the majority of Lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. LysA was expressed in Escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different Lactobacillus species and against Lactococcus lactis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that LysA is 2 and 8000 times more active against L. fermentum than L. lactis and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.
TI  - The prophages of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533: comparative genomics and transcription analysis.
AB  - Two non-inducible, but apparently complete prophages were identified in the genome of the sequenced Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC 533. The 38- and 40-kb-long prophages Lj928 and Lj965 represent distinct lineages of Sfi11-like pac-site Siphoviridae unrelated at the DNA sequence level. The deduced structural proteins from Lj928 demonstrated aa sequence identity with Lactococcus lactis phage TP901-1, while Lj965 shared sequence links with Streptococcus thermophilus phage O1205. With the exception of tRNA genes, inserted between DNA replication and DNA packaging genes, the transcription of the prophage was restricted to the genome segments near both attachment sites. Transcribed genes unrelated to phage functions were inserted between the phage repressor and integrase genes; one group of genes shared sequence relatedness with a mobile DNA element in Staphylococcus aureus. A short, but highly transcribed region was located between the phage lysin and right attachment site; it lacked a protein-encoding function in one prophage.
TI  - Lytic and nonlytic mechanism of inactivation of gram-positive bacteria by lysozyme under atmospheric and high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - A different behavior was observed in three gram-positive bacteria exposed to hen  egg white lysozyme by plate counts and phase-contrast microscopy. The inactivation of Lactobacillus johnsonii was accompanied by spheroplast formation, which is an indication of peptidoglycan hydrolysis. Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to lysozyme and showed no signs of peptidoglycan hydrolysis, and Listeria innocua was inactivated and showed indications of cell leakage but not of peptidoglycan hydrolysis. Under high hydrostatic pressure, S. aureus also became sensitive to lysozyme but did not form spheroplasts and was not lysed. These results suggested the existence of a nonlytic mechanism of bactericidal action of lysozyme on the latter two bacteria, and this mechanism was further studied in L. innocua. Elimination of the enzymic activity of lysozyme by heat denaturation or reduction with beta-mercaptoethanol eliminated this bactericidal mechanism. By means of a LIVE/DEAD viability stain based on a membrane-impermeant fluorescent dye, the nonlytic mechanism was shown to involve membrane perturbation. In the absence of lysozyme, high-pressure treatment was shown to induce autolytic activity in S. aureus and L. innocua.
TI  - Activation of human NK cells by staphylococci and lactobacilli requires cell contact-dependent costimulation by autologous monocytes.
AB  - NK cells are instrumental in innate immune responses, in particular for the early production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and other cytokines necessary to control certain bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections. NK cell-mediated effector functions are controlled by a fine balance between distinct receptors mediating activating and inhibitory signals; however, little is known about activating receptors on NK cells and their corresponding ligands. Several studies have shown that commensal lactobacilli isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract activate human mononuclear cells and are potent inducers of IFN-gamma and monocyte-derived interleukin 12 (IL-12). NK cell activation was shown for Lactobacillus johnsonii La1. In this study the cellular mechanisms of in vitro NK cell activation by gram-positive bacteria were analyzed. Staphylococcus aureus- and L. johnsonii La1-mediated activation of CD3(-) CD16(+) CD56(+) human peripheral blood NK cells, including expression of the activation antigen CD69 and secretion of IFN-gamma, required cell contact-dependent costimulation by autologous monocytes. S. aureus- and L. johnsonii-preactivated monocytes retained their capacity to induce NK cell activation. In contrast, cytokine-primed monocytes completely failed to induce NK cell activation unless bacteria were present. This suggests that phagocytosis of bacteria provided additional coactivation signals on accessory cells that may differ from those induced by tumor necrosis factor and IFN-gamma. Blocking of costimulatory molecules by B7.1, B7.2, and IL-12 but not CD14 monoclonal antibodies inhibited S. aureus- and L. johnsonii-induced effector function of NK cells. Our data suggest an important role for accessory cell-derived signals in the process of NK cell activation by gram-positive bacteria.
