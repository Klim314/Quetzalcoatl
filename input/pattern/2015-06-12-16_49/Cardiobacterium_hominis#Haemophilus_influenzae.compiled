TI  - Identification of HACEK clinical isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is a rapid and accurate tool for the identification of many microorganisms. We assessed this technology for the identification of 103 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae (HACEK) clinical isolates and 20 Haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates. Ninety-three percent of HACEK organisms were identified correctly to the genus level using the Bruker database, and 100% were identified to the genus level using a custom database that included clinical isolates.
TI  - Identification of Neisseria spp., Haemophilus spp., and other fastidious gram-negative bacteria with the MicroScan Haemophilus-Neisseria identification panel.
AB  - The Haemophilus-Neisseria identification (HNID) panel (American MicroScan, Sacramento, Calif.) is a 4-h microdilution format system for identification of Haemophilus and Neisseria spp., Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis. The HNID panel was evaluated by using 423 clinical isolates and stock strains of these organisms, and HNID identifications were compared with those obtained by conventional methods. In addition, 32 isolates representing six genera not included in the HNID data base were tested to determine whether these organisms would produce unique biotype numbers for possible inclusion in the data base. The HNID panel correctly identified 95.3% of 86 Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 96% of 25 G. vaginalis strains, and 100% of 28 Neisseria lactamica strains and 48 B. catarrhalis strains. Only 64.7% of 68 Neisseria meningitidis isolates were identified correctly owing to false-negative or equivocal carbohydrate and/or aminopeptidase reactions. Among the Haemophilus spp., 98.8% of 83 H. influenzae strains, 97.1% of 34 H. parainfluenzae strains, and 80% of 15 H. aphrophilus and H. paraphrophilus strains were correctly identified. Eight strains of Neisseria cinerea, a species not included in the data base, produced profiles identical with those for B. catarrhalis and N. gonorrhoeae. Isolates of other species not included in the data base, including Eikenella corrodens, Kingella spp., and Cardiobacterium hominis, produced unique biochemical reaction patterns on the panel. Modification of interpretative criteria for certain tests, expansion of the data base to include other species, and suggestions for additional confirmatory tests will increase the accuracy and utility of the HNID panel.
TI  - The use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  - Despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus aprophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Listeria monocytogenes. Oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. Ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. paraphrophilus, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli. Oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating S. aureus endocarditis. Carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against P. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. The cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. There have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. They have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.
