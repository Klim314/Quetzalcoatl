TI  == [brain abscess in retroperitoneal perforated colonic diverticulitis].
AB  == the most frequent complications in diverticular disease are local abscess, perforation with peritoneal sepsis, fistula and ileus. extraabdominal manifestation is an actual rarity. a haematogenous bacterial spread via portal vein with formation of liver abscess has seldom been described. but a complicated diverticular disease as a cause for a brain abscess is an absolute rarity. our case presents a patient with brain abscess caused by asymptomatic, retroperitoneal perforated colonic diverticulosis. we discuss diagnostic steps both in diverticular disease and brain abscess and different surgical options in  the treatment of colonic complicated diverticular disease.
