TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of faropenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against 405 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue infections from animal and human bites.
AB  - Faropenem, a new oral beta-lactam agent with a penem structure, was very active against 405 aerobic and anaerobic bite isolates. It inhibited 232 of 236 (98%) aerobic isolates, including all Pasteurella spp. and Eikenella corrodens at < or = 0.25 mg/L, and 164/169 (97%) anaerobic isolates, at < or = 1 mg/L. The 10 isolates that required > or = 2 mg/L for inhibition were one strain each of Acinetobacter lwoffi, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Bacteroides ovatus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Peptostreptococcus tetradius, plus Corynebacterium 'aquaticum' (two strains) and Veillonella sp. (three strains).
